1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Some humans are willing to break all the rules to contact extraterrestrial life.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,100
 And then we take a look at the interesting phenomenon known as cellular memory.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:17,100
 And that's the idea that if you get an organ transplant, you may gain parts of the donor's personality.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,600
 You might be a lifelong smoker that all of a sudden quits,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,900
 or you could be a vegetarian who's now craving a juicy hamburger.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,100
 But sometimes those cravings are much, much worse.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,700
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:38,400
 [Music]

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,300
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,600
 I'm doing another one of those.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,200
 Just came in the door.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,500
 This time I took my shoes off, but just came in the door episodes.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,700
 No downtime.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,500
 Let's see how this goes. The last one worked out.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 I don't remember which one that was.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
 And let's also thank our latest Patreon.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
 Thank you guys so much.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,700
 This is Mellow Rooze.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
 Mellow Rooze.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,700
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,000
 Keeping us Mellow in her underroos.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
 Do they still make underroos actually?

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
 I remember those. I used to wear those all the time.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,400
 Yeah, I'm sure they probably still make underroos, but it's nothing I want to research.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,300
 And let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,500
 Thank you again so much for that.

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,700
 So the first topic we're going to talk about,

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,100
 it's really interesting because I've run into people like this before.

31
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,900
 People who really believe in this stuff.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,700
 Now, we can quibble all we want about alien life.

33
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,500
 I'm sure it's out there, you know, but if it's out, I, I, I, here's the thing.

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,300
 I like my science other than like science fiction other than like fictional stuff.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,200
 I like my science fiction ideas to stay in the realm of science fiction.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,000
 And then fantasy can stay in the realm of fantasy.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,700
 So let's, for example, say this, let's say the military wants to do experiments on telepathy.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,800
 And you could have someone write a paper saying, you know, brain, brain waves are simply waves.

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,100
 I'm not saying this is real science, but brain waves are real waves and waves move in patterns.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,200
 So if you can figure out the pattern scientifically,

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,600
 you can build a device to read the brain waves as they're emanating from the skull,

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,800
 like stink lines off of that stinky kid from peanuts.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
 What was his name? Dirtbag?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,600
 It wasn't Linus. He was the blanket boy.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
 Uh, Mudslinger?

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,100
 Uh, Pudpuddle. No, wait, it was something like that. It was Pigpin, Pigpin.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,500
 Yes, that had nothing to do with where I'm going, but, so you can read brain waves like Pigpin stink lines.

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 But then people go, oh no, no, telepathy is like touching into the ether and you have this crystal and blah, blah, blah.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,000
 No, keep telepathy in the realm of like science.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,100
 Don't build a device that can read auras.

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,900
 You see what I'm going at? Like I want my science to stay in the realm of science.

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,200
 So when people tell me about UFOs and they say, you know, if you concentrate on the sky,

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,600
 you can make UFOs appear. We actually have a guy up here like that.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,500
 There's a guy near Hood River. I think it's by Mount Chastis.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,400
 So technically in, no, Mount Adams, sorry, technically in Washington,

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,000
 but he has these camps that you can go out to and you just stare up at the sky and go,

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,100
 "UFO, come to me. I want to see UFO. I want to see UFO."

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,000
 And you concentrate. It's a little more involved in that. We'll get into that in a second,

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,900
 but you concentrate, you think about a UFO and then you see a UFO.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,200
 And so you're using your astral being to contact these things.

61
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,500
 I think that's absolute rubbish, absolutely ridiculous, because I like my science to be scientific.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,800
 But, but, but I'll give myself some wiggle room here.

63
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,500
 Let's take a look at one of these processes that these people do.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,700
 There's a group called the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
 Also, SETI, it's C-SETI.

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 Now SETI is real. They're the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
 And then you have this group that believes in magic.

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,200
 It's run by a guy named Steven Greer, Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,800
 And they're all into this.

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,200
 Basically, it's for people who can't afford high-powered telescopes or are very impatient.

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,100
 They can't just wait for a UFO to fly by. They have to try to attract these things.

72
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,300
 These, so C-SETI is basically one voodoo doll away from just being full-blown magicians,

73
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
 or thinking they're magicians.

74
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,600
 They talk about the opening yourself up, making UFOs appear and stuff like that, but whatever.

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,900
 So, which begs the question, if you can do this one, there'd be UFOs everywhere,

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
 because the military would just be like, "Sick 'em, boys!"

77
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,900
 And you'd just have like a bunch of military dudes out in the desert going, "Come to me, UFOs, and UFOs would be fine."

78
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,800
 All over the place.

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,400
 And two, why is it that people just driving down the road happen to see these things,

80
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
 who are just driving down the road?

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,100
 They're not meditating on any of this stuff.

82
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
 But I could poke holes in it all day long.

83
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,600
 Let's actually take a look at what they believe in before I keep knocking this down.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,500
 For C-SETI, this is called "Coherent Thought Sequencing."

85
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
 So this is what you do.

86
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,900
 First thing you do is you have to set up some lights to signal the UFOs to your areas.

87
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,000
 So like, flares, don't burn anything down.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,100
 You don't have to use flares.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,300
 But like lights, you can get a bunch of flashlights, whatever it is.

90
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,700
 You have to build a landing area or a place where the aliens can notice you.

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,000
 Then you have to play tones.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
 Now, where do you get those tones at?

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,700
 Here's an interesting little quote that I learned from these lunatics.

94
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
 "The teams..."

95
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,300
 These are the teams that are the people out in the woods hanging out.

96
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,500
 "The teams broadcast tones over radio that were originally recorded during a contact event in a crop circle."

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 So right there, crop circles are man-made.

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,600
 So I know I'm coming down really hard on these guys, but don't worry.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
 This isn't just me debunking this stuff.

100
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,500
 This goes someplace really interesting.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,400
 Let me start over.

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,300
 "The teams broadcast tones over radio that were originally recorded during a contact event in a crop circle."

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,800
 So basically what they recorded was college students going,

104
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,300
 "Hehehe, I can't believe these guys actually believe this is an alien as they're drawing these geometric lines."

105
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
 That's not in the quote.

106
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,400
 That was me adding it.

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 Okay, let me continue.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,200
 "The tones are a part of their technology that we have recorded and are sending back to them."

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,300
 Imagine if...

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,200
 I love this part.

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 I love this part here.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 Imagine if you went into someone's home.

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,500
 And now I want you to actually imagine this, by the way, as I read this.

114
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,000
 Imagine if you went into someone's home and they had a wall of pictures.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 How interested would you be?

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
 Mildly, maybe.

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,900
 What if you noticed your picture on the wall?

118
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
 Would that pique your interest?

119
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,500
 Transmitting their own technology back to them is our attempt to put their picture on the wall.

120
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,000
 Now, speaking personally from experience, when I go to someone's house and they have a wall of pictures,

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,600
 the first thing I do is go, "Oh, is there anyone hot in any of these pictures?

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,100
 Is there an attractive woman in any of these pictures?"

123
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,700
 And, you know, there may or may not be.

124
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
 But that's my first thing.

125
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,600
 Okay, let me back up here.

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,200
 I don't stalk people's houses.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,500
 I'm like, "Oh, I hope they invite me over tonight.

128
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 I need to find some beautiful women."

129
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,300
 But generally, my eyes are drawn to attractive women.

130
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,100
 So if I'm in a house and they have a bunch of pictures, I will look around and go, "Oh, she's hot.

131
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 Okay?

132
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,800
 Now, so that might be a little too revealing."

133
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,900
 But if I walked into someone's house and I never met before,

134
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,300
 because that's the aliens in the example, it's a house that you've never met these people before.

135
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,400
 If I walked into a house of people I've never, ever met before,

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,300
 and there was a photo of me, a blurry photo of me walking down the street,

137
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,800
 that would pique my interest.

138
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,300
 It would also pique my paranoia and my fight-or-flight response.

139
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,800
 So I get their point, but that might be the worst analogy.

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,000
 If I ever walk into someone's house and I saw a photo of me, I am not going to turn around and go,

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
 "I am feel welcome here.

142
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 I want to turn around and start looking for any sharp and/or heavy object to fight my way out of the house."

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
 So, tones.

144
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,800
 You play the tones.

145
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,000
 The aliens go, "Oh, that is the song that we recorded in a crop circle."

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,900
 And they're like, "Yeah, I remember when we were getting in the crop circle saying we were college students."

147
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
 And they're like, "Yeah, that was pretty funny."

148
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,200
 Then you sit and you meditate on the existence of aliens.

149
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
 You sit there and you really focus your mind on the fact that aliens exist.

150
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,700
 You feel your essence start to go up.

151
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 Some of you are catching on what's going on here too.

152
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,000
 And this is actually a real thing, coherent thought sequencing.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,900
 You meditate.

154
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,000
 Your spirit goes up and it goes to a UFO and you wait to be invited into the UFO.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And then when you go into the UFO, you are able to interact with the aliens and you give them a map back to your home.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,700
 Not your home.

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,400
 Well, where you're at, you can do this at home.

158
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,000
 It doesn't matter.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You have to have the lights.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,700
 You have to have the tone.

161
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,800
 You want to meditate.

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,300
 You enter their UFO with their permission and then you guide them back to your location.

163
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,900
 So, think about this.

164
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:02,300
 If you replace the lights with candles, you replace the tone with chanting, you replace the meditate.

165
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,600
 You don't have to replace the meditation.

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
 It is normal.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,300
 Or the tones would be an invocation.

168
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,600
 The meditation is simply the meditation you would do with, yes, a spell.

169
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
 The idea of an astral travel leaving your body to this other realm,

170
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:23,100
 waiting, asking for permission to engage these powerful spirits and then bringing them back to your little area,

171
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,800
 that is 100% a spell.

172
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,700
 Now, they're not saying light a circle of red and black candles alternate the colors.

173
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,500
 And on a full moon, they're just saying, "Put some lights up, play this tone, meditate, ask for permission."

174
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,400
 All that stuff.

175
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,700
 It's a spell.

176
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,000
 And this is why it might work.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So as much trash talking as I was doing earlier, this is why it might work.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
 But I don't think they're calling aliens.

179
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,900
 Let's go back to the year 1918.

180
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,500
 We're hopping the Jason Jalopy so we can keep undercover.

181
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,700
 We're both wearing dapper clothes.

182
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,400
 I'm wearing one of those little bowler hats with like the rounded top and a tie.

183
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
 I have an old-timey mustache.

184
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,000
 You are dressed the way you're dressed.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
 Well, you're dressed exactly how you're dressed right now.

186
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,700
 So hopefully you have some clothes.

187
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,800
 You're like, "Jason, why can't I get awesome clothes like that?

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,500
 I'm like honking the horn really loud so I can't hear you."

189
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,900
 Silently giggling.

190
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,000
 People are thinking you're a witch and we're driving around.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
 I'm driving super slow just so people can get a good look at you.

192
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,200
 You're like, "Jason, I'm listening to this episode in the shower."

193
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
 I'm like, "Yee-hee-hee."

194
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,000
 So we're driving through town and we're going to meet a dude named Alistair Crowley.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,400
 Now, Alistair Crowley is probably the most recognizable man in the dark arts in occultism.

196
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,900
 There, you could say Anton LeVe is up there.

197
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,500
 But I think Alistair Crowley is probably the most recognizable name.

198
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,400
 And anyway, he's also the name of the bad guy on Supernatural.

199
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,300
 I think I don't know if he's still around on that show, but anyways, he was when I stopped watching it.

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,300
 So Alistair Crowley comes to America and he starts really getting into occult activities.

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,300
 And he meets up with this woman named Roddy Miner.

202
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,900
 Roddy Miner, not Roddy Miner.

203
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,600
 That would be like hilarious.

204
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,500
 No, wouldn't actually.

205
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,600
 Sad Miners are all dying in caves and they're like, "Ugh, maybe someday Jason will make a joke about me."

206
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 And it'll all be worth it as they rot away.

207
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,500
 Anyways, Alistair Crowley and Roddy Miner, they start performing sex magic.

208
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
 They get really into the occult.

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,300
 They start doing all of this really weirdo stuff.

210
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,800
 And they start on this path called Alumtra Working.

211
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,100
 And it was this path that they wanted to go on.

212
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,300
 And a path, a magical path is like, I'm trying to think of the best way to explain it.

213
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,800
 It's basically like a series of steps. They're working towards a specific goal using magic.

214
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,300
 It's basically they go, "This is our end goal, but we just can't do it today. We have to do all these little steps."

215
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,000
 So they're doing this and they're also doing copious amounts of drugs.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
 So they're super high.

217
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
 They're banging all the time and they're just calling it magic and they're working on this stuff and they're meditating.

218
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
 And they end up through the course of this working.

219
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,400
 They meet a king, not in real life, like in the astral plane.

220
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,200
 They meet a king, they meet a small boy, and they meet a wizard named Amlitra, which is why I said it.

221
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
 But I pronounced it differently a second ago.

222
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,300
 That's why they called it Amlitra Working.

223
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
 And Amlitra gave them a directive.

224
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,800
 He said, "Find the egg."

225
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,300
 So they were looking for this egg forever, right?

226
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,900
 It's the ultimate Easter egg hunt.

227
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,700
 They're like, "I can't find the egg. I think we have to bang more."

228
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,100
 They keep banging. They're looking, turning over the couch and no egg. Have sex.

229
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
 This goes on and on.

230
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:37,200
 But through the course of their sex drug fueled magic, they meet an entity known as Lamb, L-A-M.

231
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 When you look at drawings of Lamb, it looks almost identical to what we describe as a gray alien.

232
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,500
 The only difference is the size of the eyes.

233
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,700
 Lamb has kind of normal eyes, but it has this giant head, tiny little mouth, tiny little nose.

234
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,900
 Looks like a gray alien except for the size of the eyes.

235
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,200
 Now remember, this is happening back in 1918.

236
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,900
 The idea of what a gray alien looked like, forget ancient aliens because that's all made up.

237
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:08,500
 But when we look at ideas of gray aliens, those really weren't talked about until the 1950s.

238
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 So this way precedes that stuff.

239
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,600
 And Alistair Crowley's drawing pictures of this Lamb guy.

240
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,500
 He actually says, "These aren't pictures. These are like portraits."

241
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,800
 This is exactly what they look like. I guess portraits are pictures.

242
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,200
 He's saying, "These aren't pictures or portraits. These are basically photographs.

243
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,000
 These are exactly what he looks like. There's no artistic license in Lamb's head."

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,500
 But now we're going to jump ahead to the year 1972.

245
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,300
 So Alistair Crowley is gone at this point. He's dead.

246
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:43,400
 And the group he set up, the OTO, the Ordo Templi Orientus, has fractured.

247
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,500
 Because you know, that's usually what happens. Some guy starts a cult.

248
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,300
 He passes away. There's no real chain of command or there's no chain of secession afterwards.

249
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,200
 So it splits up and people have this power struggle and stuff like that.

250
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 This one guy sets up the Typhonian Order Templi Orientus, or Orntes, Orntes, right?

251
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
 And he comes up with a way to contact Lamb.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
 He wants to go back to the old ways.

253
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,400
 He wants to follow the footsteps of Alistair Crowley and talk to Lamb again.

254
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,800
 And he came up with this thing in 1972 called the Lamb Statement.

255
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
 These are the steps.

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,100
 Have a picture of Lamb. Concentrate on it. Silent repetition of the name.

257
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,500
 Lamb, Lamb, Lamb.

258
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 Lamb Chop shows up singing a song. You're like, "No, not you."

259
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,100
 If you have a positive feeling, you can enter the egg.

260
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
 So Lamb's floating around this egg.

261
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,100
 And if you feel positive, you can enter the egg and you can interact.

262
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,500
 You actually see through Lamb's eyes.

263
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,600
 You're now in this other plane of existence.

264
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,300
 But if you have a negative feeling, then the ritual is not going to work.

265
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,500
 And you just come back to your immortal body.

266
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,900
 After you spend some time inside a Lamb, hanging out,

267
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,800
 you can then close your eyes and then you leave Lamb and then you do a banishing ritual.

268
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,100
 And it's over with.

269
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,700
 Now, there's a key step left out of this because he's doing a banishing ritual at the end.

270
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,300
 So at the beginning, you also do a protection ritual,

271
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,900
 circular protection is what it's called, which involves candles and an area that's safe for you.

272
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,600
 So, and that's not included in the steps because that's just a given for any type of spell.

273
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,700
 So what we have is the spell that the Center for the Search of Extraterrestrial Intelligence is using.

274
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,200
 And if you think that's a stretch, the Lamb statement was written in 1972.

275
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence came out with their coherent thought sequencing in 1973.

276
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,300
 It is stolen directly from that.

277
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:45,500
 So either Alistair Crowley found a way to contact an alien using the power of his mind and dark magic.

278
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,700
 Or you have a bunch of people in the woods, a bunch of borderline hippie dudes thinking that they can look them in the sky

279
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,100
 and concentrate and see a UFO and be one with the universe.

280
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,500
 And they're not contacting aliens as we know them.

281
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:09,100
 They're practicing dark magic and contacting something that influenced one of the most influential occultists of all time.

282
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,400
 Basically, don't go hang out with those guys because you know what's going to happen.

283
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,300
 For all you know, it's the cosmic equivalent of Charlie Charlie plus a Ouija board.

284
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,000
 Like just don't do that stuff.

285
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,700
 Because who knows, what if that's like a...

286
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,800
 That'd be an interesting story.

287
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,600
 Like there's a bunch of demons out there and they're pretending to be space aliens.

288
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,000
 That's a really common idea, but they actually have to have humans want them to cut...

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,100
 Oh, never mind, that's stupid.

290
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 Okay, so let's go ahead and...

291
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
 That's basically every Annabelle movie ever.

292
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,900
 Let's go ahead and move on with our next story here.

293
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,700
 Now, I...

294
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,000
 So I recently had a cat put in my tooth.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
 I've talked about that before.

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 And I have some bone loss up in my upper jaw.

297
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's not a lot, but it just happens, you know, bad hygiene stuff.

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
 I mean, I brush my teeth, but it's one of those things like you're supposed to floss and do all that other stuff.

299
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,800
 But anyway, so I have lost a little bit of bone up there and I had some gum issues.

300
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,600
 And when they put the cap in, they said,

301
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,100
 "We're going to come back in six months and if the bone grows back, you're kosher.

302
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,600
 But if it doesn't grow back, we'll fill it in."

303
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,300
 And I saw, of course, I go, "Well, what are the chances of it growing back?"

304
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,400
 And the dentist was like, "It's most likely going to grow back.

305
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,700
 I don't see a problem with it, but it's just a procedure we do."

306
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,600
 But of course, I went home and started researching this because I found that fascinating.

307
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,700
 Like, I didn't really know bone grew back like that, but then I thought,

308
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,000
 "Well, that's what happens with the broken ankle."

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So it's kind of thinking about it, if...

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
 Because, you know, he was saying it may not.

311
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,000
 But if your bone of your mouth, your jaw, what...

312
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,300
 The bone in your mouth, that's the best way to put it, because that's the way I already put it.

313
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,500
 If it doesn't grow back, they can do a bone graft.

314
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,300
 Now, there's three different ways they can do it.

315
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,700
 One, they can take bone from your hip, but that's very expensive because there's two surgery sites.

316
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,600
 They can take bone from a cow and put it in there.

317
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,200
 Or they can take bone from a cadaver and put it up in there.

318
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
 And I was like, "Ugh."

319
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,200
 And I thought it was kind of interesting because although a human body replayed,

320
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,500
 no single cell in your body is the same it was seven years ago.

321
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,600
 Your body's constantly regenerating and dying off, regenerating and dying off.

322
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
 Even though I don't actually have the same body,

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,900
 I don't have a single cell that existed back when I was 35.

324
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,400
 You know, go further back.

325
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,700
 Like, by the time you're seven, you're basically a from every atom up, you're a completely different person.

326
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,800
 I've never had another person like inside of me.

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
 I've never had like parts of other people and that's not a sex joke.

328
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,000
 Like, I've never...

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,600
 The idea of having a part of my body like having another person's part, I can't think of it.

330
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,900
 I know it keeps sounding like a sex thing, but taking other people's stuff and put never mind.

331
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
 You guys get the point, right?

332
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,600
 And even a cow, like it would just be weird.

333
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
 And I talked to the dentist about that.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,100
 It was actually the orthodude, endocronist, whatever.

335
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,700
 The endodude, he goes, "It's like Encino Man except he does teeth."

336
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,900
 He said, "Here's the thing, Jason."

337
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,400
 He goes, "Yes, it does sound weird, but what happens is they scrape off all of the cellular material."

338
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,800
 So it's basically just, it's just the mineral.

339
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,500
 He goes, "There's actually nothing left of the cow or the cadaver.

340
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,700
 It's just the minerals that make up the bone that we put in your mouth."

341
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,600
 And I go, "Well, you know about cellular memory, right?"

342
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,900
 And he's like, "I've heard of cellular memory. I have, but there's no cellular material in this."

343
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,400
 So whatever he goes, I go, "What would you chose?"

344
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
 I go, "Between the two."

345
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
 Because I'm not going to pay for two surgeries.

346
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
 I go, "What would you choose?"

347
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 And he goes, "I wouldn't care. I really wouldn't care.

348
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
 If it was a cow or if it was a cadaver, it wouldn't matter to me."

349
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,400
 But let's talk briefly about cellular memory because it's going to take us to a really cool place there.

350
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,700
 Maybe not cool.

351
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,800
 Quite tragic.

352
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,300
 But cellular memory is this idea or theory, however you want to put it.

353
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,800
 You get a heart transplant.

354
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
 You get it put in.

355
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
 The previous owner of the heart loved to gamble

356
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,400
 or loved to smell a pork or has a smoking problem.

357
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,900
 And you do none of those things, but all of a sudden you have this new part in you

358
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
 and you start to develop a craving for nicotine

359
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,000
 or you start to develop a need to go to Vegas

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,300
 or you start to develop something for the second example I gave.

361
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,900
 And there's a ton of examples for this, but it's one of those things that

362
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,800
 there's a ton of examples of cellular memory.

363
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:21,000
 But there's, let's say there's hundreds of thousands of organs donated back and forth

364
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
 a year or a decade.

365
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,800
 It may not be 100,000 a year, but let's say there's 10,000, just for example,

366
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,000
 10,000 organ donations a year.

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,100
 And then every so often you read a story about someone having cellular memory.

368
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,100
 If cellular memory was actually a thing, you would see it 70% of the time

369
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,700
 or 50% of the time and it may be and people just aren't reporting it.

370
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,000
 It may not be so wacky like our next story, but if it was an actual thing,

371
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,900
 one, you think it would be reported more and two, it would be very easy to test.

372
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
 You would just be like, let's see if this works.

373
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
 You take a heart and you put it in someone else and he's like, no,

374
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,400
 no, I love my heart, but you put it in and you could test it.

375
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,700
 It's an easy theory to test.

376
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,300
 It'd be inhumane to test, but you could test it.

377
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,100
 See if there is any actual proof of that.

378
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,500
 But a cellular memory, whether or not it's true, I actually find quite fascinating.

379
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,700
 It's one of those things that I really, really enjoy to read about.

380
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,200
 So let's take a look at one of the most bizarre stories I've come across

381
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,900
 involving cellular memory.

382
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,600
 The year is 1995.

383
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,500
 We're still in the Jason Jalopy.

384
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,000
 We're leaving.

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
 Where were we before?

386
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
 I don't remember that last story.

387
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
 I don't remember what we were talking about.

388
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,500
 Oh, UFOs.

389
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,000
 New York.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,900
 So we're leaving New York City.

391
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,000
 We're driving down to South Carolina.

392
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
 That's quite the trip.

393
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,200
 It'll be fun though.

394
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,300
 It'll be allow you to change your clothes into a period of appropriate clothes,

395
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,600
 but we're in the year 1995.

396
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,300
 So just got to wear like a flannel jacket and then another set of flannel tied around your waist.

397
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,000
 We'll cut the sleeves off your flannel.

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,600
 I'm still wearing my dapper suit because I am iconoclast.

399
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,300
 Is that the word?

400
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,900
 I don't know if I'm using it appropriately.

401
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,400
 I'm fashionable no matter what I wear.

402
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
 So we're driving through town with Jason Jalopy.

403
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,800
 We're going to Monk's Corner.

404
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,300
 And there we meet a couple, Terry Cottle and Cheryl Sweatt.

405
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,400
 They're pretty young, pretty young couple.

406
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,100
 They were previously married to other people.

407
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
 They cheated on their spouses.

408
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,200
 They ended up getting together and they have horrible marital problems.

409
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,900
 There's much problems going on.

410
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,800
 And one day Terry Cottle is like, I can't handle this.

411
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,600
 And Cheryl just was like throwing her ring over the fence and they're having this big argument.

412
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,300
 And then the next day in the bathroom, Terry shoots himself and goes into a coma.

413
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,600
 Pulls out a revolver, shoots himself and they take him to the hospital.

414
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 Four days later, Terry dies.

415
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,700
 Well, to be specific, Cheryl has the plug pulled on Terry.

416
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,000
 But Terry had an organ donor card.

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,700
 So Terry's heart was donated to an older man.

418
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,200
 He's 57 years old named Sunny Graham.

419
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,400
 Sunny, Sunny Graham.

420
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,000
 Sunny Graham, 60 miles away, gets Terry's heart and he's doing great.

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 He's doing great.

422
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,700
 He has the heart transplant he needed.

423
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,900
 He had some congenital defect or something like that.

424
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,900
 Maybe he wasn't congenital.

425
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,300
 Maybe he was just bad, bad diet.

426
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
 But it doesn't matter.

427
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 Got a new heart.

428
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,300
 He ends up making contact with Cheryl.

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,100
 He wants to find out a little bit about the person he got the heart from.

430
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,700
 Maybe pay some respect to the family.

431
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,000
 Immediately falls in love with Cheryl.

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,100
 Sunny's married.

433
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,800
 Sunny boy is married.

434
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,700
 Cheryl is married to another person.

435
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,900
 Then she marries another person, but eventually she does marry Sunny boy.

436
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,400
 Relationship's a total mess.

437
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,500
 He goes into debt.

438
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 He actually had more.

439
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
 He was doing fine before he met Cheryl.

440
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,900
 He bought her a house while he was trying to woo her.

441
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,000
 Buys her a house, right?

442
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,400
 For her and her three kids.

443
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
 But by the time they get together, he's super in debt.

444
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
 And one day things weren't working out.

445
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,700
 Sunny goes out to the shed, sits down.

446
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
 I don't know if he sat down.

447
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,000
 Walks in the shed, stood up.

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,900
 Doesn't matter.

449
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,000
 Grab the 12-gauge shotgun, puts it to his neck, kills himself.

450
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
 And at that point, no one wanted that heart.

451
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,300
 People...

452
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,300
 There was about a 10-year time span between when Terry died and then he got the heart.

453
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,800
 Sunny got the heart pretty quickly.

454
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,600
 They don't let him sit on a shelf.

455
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,900
 And then about 10 years later, 12 years later, he shoots himself in the neck.

456
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,800
 He dies.

457
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,500
 It's really interesting because this is considered one of the most unusual cases of cellular memory.

458
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,700
 Because he did start to get a craving for hot dogs.

459
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,500
 That was something that he never had a craving for until he got the heart.

460
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 So he started to enjoy hot dogs.

461
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,300
 He started to love beer.

462
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,700
 He started to drink a lot of beer.

463
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
 And his minister said, you know, it was really weird.

464
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,300
 After he got the heart transplant, he seemed...

465
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,000
 He didn't...

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's not like he seemed completely different.

467
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,900
 But he seemed restless.

468
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,200
 He seemed...

469
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,400
 I don't want to put words into the minister's mouth, but just restless was the term he used.

470
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
 So I'm thinking maybe a little agitated.

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,700
 Maybe he felt a little out of place.

472
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,200
 The minister did notice a change in him after the heart transplant.

473
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,300
 And I came across this story because I was looking into cellular memory because I found out about my possible little bone replacement in there.

474
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:02,200
 And I'm reading this and I go, yeah, that is an interesting case of cellular memory, but I have some questions.

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 So I dug a little more, like a little gopher.

476
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,700
 Got my little paws into the internet and moving dirt around, which is really just typing in words into Google.

477
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,400
 Let's take a look at some of the facts of this case.

478
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,900
 When Terry died,

479
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,600
 Cheryl said, "My son came running up to me and said, 'Terry shot himself, Terry shot himself.'

480
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,300
 And I went and I kicked open the kitchen door, not the kitchen door, and I didn't kick it open.

481
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,900
 I walked into the bathroom and saw Terry with a revolver lying next to him."

482
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,200
 But then later,

483
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,000
 she says that she was actually able to run into the room as he was getting ready to pull the trigger.

484
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,500
 Not huge, not a huge thing.

485
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 Now, apparently Terry had made comments about killing himself to close friends and family before this happened.

486
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,400
 But he shoots himself in the head and goes into a coma for four days and Cheryl has the plug pulled.

487
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
 Now I'm going to start using the word "allegedly."

488
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,600
 So, allegedly, remember how I said how Cheryl had a couple of relationships before she ended up with Sunny, the person who got Terry's heart?

489
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 At least one of them.

490
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,400
 At least one of them and maybe both of them,

491
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,200
 because I only wrote down on my notes one of them, but I'm pretty sure both of them complained about this.

492
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,000
 Very volatile, violent relationship, allegedly,

493
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,500
 and one of them said, "She threatened to shoot me on multiple occasions."

494
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,300
 If you, allegedly, shot somebody in the head and realized they don't die immediately

495
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,500
 and it's possible that they're going to be in a coma for a while

496
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,100
 until you make the decision to pull the plug,

497
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,000
 wouldn't you possibly learn from your mistakes and think,

498
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,800
 "Hmm, next time I will use a bigger gun."

499
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,100
 A revolver was the first time.

500
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,400
 Now I'm going to use a 12-gauge shotgun and I'm going to go for the neck

501
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,700
 because it's really hard to survive a neck wound.

502
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,600
 Barless skull, far more fragile part of the body.

503
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,100
 It's possible when we look at the theory of cellular memory

504
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,400
 that Sunny got the heart of Terry and that a heart was burdened with something

505
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,200
 on a cellular level, the memories were still there, the pain and the torment was still there.

506
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,700
 And that may have been why he fell in love with Cheryl in the first place.

507
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:24,200
 And so when things weren't going right, that essence, that spirit, whatever you want to call it,

508
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,800
 infused Sunny's body, overrode his better judgment

509
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,400
 and one day he took the way out that he knew would work

510
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,200
 because it worked for the previous owner of that heart.

511
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,500
 It's possible.

512
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,800
 But sometimes you have to look at not what's possible, but what's more likely.

513
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,100
 You could have somebody gaining the memories, personalities

514
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,000
 and eventually the same demise as the previous owner of the heart.

515
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,600
 Or you could have something that happens every single day, cold blood and murder, for an easy way out.

516
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,400
 I think the idea of being murdered because finances weren't working out

517
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,900
 or the marriage wasn't working out sucks.

518
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
 I think that's a horrible way to go.

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,900
 But that would be a lot better than spending 12 years with the heart of a man who killed himself,

520
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,800
 fighting for control of your body.

521
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,500
 One is unfortunately an everyday occurrence.

522
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,000
 The other one is living a horror movie, fighting an eventually losing battle

523
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,900
 between what you know is right and that darkness growing inside of you.

524
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,200
 Now, at the end of the day, I'm a man of science

525
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
 and whether I need to get bovine bone in me or cadaver bone in me

526
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 or no bone at all in a heels on its own, I'm like the dentist dude.

527
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
 I don't care.

528
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,500
 It's all just gunk.

529
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
 They can stick in me, do whatever.

530
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,700
 But what if this bone came from a mad cow?

531
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,000
 What if this bone came from a mad man?

532
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,500
 What if I am the unlucky recipient of the bone shavings of not only a man who killed himself

533
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,900
 but a cannibal, a bloodthirsty cannibal?

534
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,700
 That's not going to keep me from getting a bone graft.

535
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:23,700
 But from time to time, from time to time, it may keep me up at night thinking,

536
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,200
 who is in my mouth?

537
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,500
