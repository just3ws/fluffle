1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 Between 1970 and 1971, an alien was spotted multiple times in the country of Finland.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
 And we'll discover why they never returned to that country.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,160
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy that the country of Finland doesn't exist at all.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,640
 Is there any truth to the rumor that the entire world has been deceived by Russia and Japan

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
 to hide up the best fishing location in the world?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:40,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so let's just jump right into it.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,640
 This is the episode I wanted to do yesterday to kind of go off of the Fino Korean hyper war

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
 segment I did, I think it was on Monday.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,560
 We didn't have an episode on Monday, but anyways, I wanted to have this episode come out yesterday.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,160
 I was just too beat, but we're doing all Finland.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,560
 We're going all in on the Finanese, the finish, the finish, that's the word I'm looking for.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,160
 So hop on board the carpenter copter.

17
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,640
 We are going to a small little village in Finland.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,160
 It is no, and I gotta warn you, if you're a long time listener of the show,

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
 I'm not going to be able to pronounce any of this.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,480
 All of this stuff is really, really hard to pronounce.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,120
 We are going to Imjarvi.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,400
 Imjarvi.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
 We're going to Imjarvi, and it's in southern Finland.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,200
 Okay?

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,960
 Finland's not that big to begin with.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,680
 I don't even know why they bother having a southern part of it.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,440
 It's basically just a blob of land in between a bunch of other countries.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,920
 But anyways, we're going to Imjarvi.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,400
 The year is 1970.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,840
 It is a cold, blustery, January morning.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,160
 Now, there's two dudes, Skeen.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,480
 One of them is named...

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,960
 This is...

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,160
 Okay, I don't know if the article listed this as his occupation or his first name,

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 but I'm pretty sure it's his first name.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,720
 His name is Woodman Hainonen.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,280
 Woodman Hainonen, which was a dope...

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,120
 I mean, that's a dope name, just Woodman.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,440
 Oh no, call me Wood for short, please.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,080
 Woodman and then his buddy, Escovijo, which sounds like the name of a buddy.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
 Sounds like that guy was born, his parents named him that,

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,560
 knowing he would just be a sidekick.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
 Escovijo, that's a sidekick's name.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,200
 Woodman is like this powerful leader guy, and Escovijo is like his little goblin friend in the

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,520
 background going, "Yes, Woodman! Yes!"

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,120
 He was destined to be a toadie.

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,480
 So anyways, Woodman and Esco are skeeing through Imjarvi, southern Finland, right?

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
 And then they're like, "Oh, I'm getting tired."

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
 "Yes, master! Time to rest! Yes, master!"

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,880
 So they take a break, and as Esco is preparing Woodman's food for him,

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,120
 just the way he likes it, they start to see a light in the sky.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
 I'm like, "Hey, look at that."

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's just the light in the sky, right?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,320
 Obviously it was unusual enough to capture their attention.

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,520
 It wasn't a star or the moon, and it was kind of getting dark.

56
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,480
 It wasn't the middle of the day, but it wasn't noon either.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,920
 So anyways, that's the build up.

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
 And they start to hear a buzzing noise.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,480
 Now like, that's a weird combination of things.

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,880
 Bright light, no buzzing noise, don't even think about it.

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,560
 Buzzing noise, no bright light.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
 Maybe I just invented a cell phone and it's ringing in my pocket for the first time ever.

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,000
 But it was a combination of those two, and as the light gets closer, the buzzing gets louder,

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,640
 and then they see a disc-shaped ship.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
 Fine saucer.

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
 But this has an interesting component to it.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,320
 I won't waste your time with boring UFO stories.

68
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,840
 I think you've picked up on that by now.

69
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
 Anyways, Red Grey Mist is coming out of this craft, or appearing around the craft would be more apt.

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,800
 And the ship was so low to the ground that Woodman said,

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,320
 "I could have touched it if I had reached up with my ski stick."

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,960
 It's a ski pool, dummy, but we get your point.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,680
 They said it was about 12 feet off the, I think it's a ski pool.

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,320
 Maybe the terminology is different, but they said it would, that's really low for a UFO that hasn't landed.

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,960
 I mean, I know, but just any aircraft that's hovering 12 feet off the ground, it's incredibly low.

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,600
 At that point, it's not right over them.

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,680
 It's not like floating right over the heads, but it's nearby.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,040
 At that point, there's like this protrusion, there's like this tube sticking out of the bottom of it,

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
 and this bright light shoots out of the tube and goes, and it's like hits the ground.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,800
 So they're basically looking at this UFO hovering in front of them on this cold, cold day,

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 and then a beam shoot out of the bottom of it.

82
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,440
 And Woodman's looking at it, and he says he felt something from behind.

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
 Grab him and pull him backwards.

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,800
 And he's never been able to explain what that force was,

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
 but he said he felt like someone wrapped their arms around his waist and pulled him

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
 backwards so he's not so close to the beam.

87
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,680
 And the light starts going, like pulsating, and then being an alien shows up.

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,720
 Now this alien's described as being three feet tall, which is typical of what we describe as

89
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,680
 greys or generally very short, but all of these other descriptions aren't typical of what we know

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
 of as gray aliens.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,720
 Three feet tall, dressed in a green overall type suit, where the skin was exposed, you could see

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
 pale flesh.

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520
 So I'm imagining it's like wearing some Oshkosh bagash stuff, like his shoulders are bare,

94
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
 or it's like marky marketing, he has one, just one shoulder hanging off.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,320
 But he's wearing like these green overalls, thin arms and legs, and oddly enough green boots on.

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,280
 Well I guess, I don't know, I guess the idea I think why I find that weird is,

97
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,720
 I don't know, the idea of having skinny legs and wearing boots at the same time.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,520
 I just imagine you're like Spinelli from Recess where she has those little tiny legs,

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080
 those Doc Martens, I guess the visual is that the boots are there, but they're way too big for the

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
 aliens feet.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
 Wearing a helmet, so they don't see its face, it has a conical helmet on.

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
 Basically a big old dunce cap.

103
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,400
 So they can't see its face, it's wearing this suit, it appears out of the beam,

104
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,960
 and it's holding this black box that seems to have a yellow glow around it.

105
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,640
 And without really any input or any action by Woodman and Esco, the alien turns towards Woodman,

106
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,280
 points the box, just kind of holds the box in his direction.

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
 Woodman says, "It felt like he was pointing a weapon at me."

108
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,200
 And then all of a sudden, sparks.

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,240
 I know this sounds really cheesy and sci-fi and the little Buck Rogers, but

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
 sparks shoot out of the ground in front of Esco and Woodman.

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
 So it's not like a beam shot out of the box, just all these sparks, these multi-colored sparks,

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
 shoot out of the snow right in front of them.

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
 They're like shielding their eyes.

114
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
 They didn't take any damage, they were totally fine, they had immunity to alien sparks.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,040
 And at that point, the red-grey mist started to appear again, started to envelop them,

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,560
 and then the mist disappeared, the UFO disappeared, the alien disappeared, the event was over.

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,360
 Woodman was paralyzed on the right side, Esco actually had to help him get home.

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,200
 "Yes, master, me carry you."

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,520
 So he, Esco carries Woodman back.

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,200
 Woodman's just reading a book as Esco's carrying him through the snow.

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,120
 But eventually, the promises went away.

122
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
 The story gets reported, becomes a huge news story.

123
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
 A journalist, an interpreter who could notice how to speak Finnish,

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,760
 a photographer and Esco and Woodman go back to the location where this happened,

125
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,440
 and they said, the reports go, when they got back there, the three people who hadn't been there before,

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,560
 photographer, interpreter, and the journalist, their hands started to glow red when they got

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
 to the location, and Woodman started having a headache and they left.

128
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,640
 Now, it could just be that Woodman needed to take a little Tylenol, and that doesn't necessarily mean

129
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,720
 that he was having some alien things.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,400
 And people, so this story was really popular when it came out,

131
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,720
 but people really started to dispute it or think that it was a hoax,

132
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,760
 because Woodman kept talking about other encounters he was having with aliens afterwards.

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,480
 And they really thought he was just making stuff up until I get back in the news.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,600
 And one of them, he told people, he's like, "Oh yeah, I was talking to this blonde woman,

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,680
 and I was pretty sure she was an alien, so I pulled my camera out to take a picture and she

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
 disappeared." Put me in your newspaper.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,320
 And people were like, "Maybe the woman just didn't want to be photographed."

138
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,440
 And he'd be like, "Uh..."

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,200
 So he kept telling these other encounters he had with these alien people coming down,

140
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,320
 which one, the blonde woman, now that I think about it, she's not running around in green

141
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,520
 suit with a cone head.

142
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,920
 Like, why would he, if you're going to make up the story, make up a story that builds on the

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,960
 mythology of your original story? As far as it being a hoax, I mean, Esco's going to go along

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,720
 with anything that Woodman says anyways. He's totally going to back him up if Woodman just

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
 goes, "You know what would be funny if we made this story up."

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,920
 But that's not where our story ends. Could be a hoax, but we're going to look at some

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,080
 other, okay, some other strange accounts that happened around the same time in the same country.

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:10,000
 In February 2nd, 1971, two women are driving through Kimiki. Sounds very cute. Sounds like a

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
 city you could date. Actually, that's a county, but it sounds like a county you could date.

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,600
 Kimiki. And they're driving through Kimiki, and it's about three hours. It's in the general

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
 region of where the last sighting was. So that one took place, the first one took place in

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,040
 January 1970. Now we're February 1971, February 2nd, 1971. Two women are driving through Kimiki,

153
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,240
 and they see an alien run across the street. They described it as being three foot tall,

154
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,920
 wearing a helmet, with a brown green suit. They're saying the suit wasn't completely brown,

155
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,320
 it had some green elements in it, but it still matches up enough to the other encounter. But

156
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
 Jason, didn't you just say that the first story got a bunch of press? Could be hoax? And it's fine.

157
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,720
 They could be piggybacking off of that, but it's a year later. His story is already gone from the

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,320
 newspapers. If you're going to jump on the bandwagon, you would assume they would do it earlier.

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
 And that's all their story was. They were driving around Kimiki, and they saw an alien run across

160
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,040
 the street. So again, if you're going to hoax, if you're going to make something up, have them say,

161
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,520
 "You must save the planet from carbon stuff and like pollution's bad," and you just make up all

162
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,560
 the environmental nonsense. Don't just say, "If you're making it up, you'll make up something

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,600
 more interesting then." I almost, I saw an alien run across the street. It's a weird thing to make up.

164
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,200
 But this is where we get into why I want to talk about this story. I think the box shooting the

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:44,800
 sparks is cool and all, but this story shows the world how close encounters should actually go.

166
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,840
 All that stuff was the appetizer. This is the main course, ladies and gentlemen.

167
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:57,040
 February 5, 1971. Three days after the alien was spotted running across the street.

168
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,520
 And there's no, I couldn't find the location for where this took place, but again, Finland's not

169
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,800
 that big of a country. They could be on the northern tip and it'd be across the street.

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,040
 So I don't have the location for where this story took place. We just have, which I know is super

171
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,400
 suspicious, but this story is so awesome. I will put aside my skepticism for this one.

172
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,080
 Three days after the women spotted the alien running across the street,

173
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,760
 we have two lumberjacks. We have Peter, Ali Ranta, and Esko Snek.

174
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,640
 Really, what is it? In Finland, if you have a sidekick name, you have to be friends with someone

175
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,440
 with a more powerful name. Peter and Esko. Who has the last name Snek? That's the sound effect that

176
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,760
 Wolverine's claws make. I don't get it. Why could I? If my last name was Snek, I would not name him

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,880
 Esko. But that's so, don't name your kids names, don't name your kids names that make them sidekicks.

178
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,600
 Just don't do it. Or worse, comedic sidekicks. Like Esko is not as bad. What was the first name here?

179
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,680
 What? His name was Esko too? What? I didn't even pick up on that. Both of these guys' names are Esko.

180
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,680
 That's weird. I'm going to have to make sure that I didn't miswrite those names here. Hold on

181
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:33,920
 one second. Because that's bizarre. Is Esko a popular name over there? No way. That would be

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,400
 bizarre. I think I mistyped it. So let's see here. How are you guys doing today? Oh, oh yeah, here, hold on.

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,960
 Yeah, dude, Esko. And I did realize where it took place. Canula. So it was about three hours away

184
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,160
 from the sighting of the dude running across the street, little alien man running across the street.

185
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,320
 Both of their names are Esko. That is totally correct. Kimiki is halfway between Canala and

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,760
 Imjarvi if I'm reading these maps right, which there's a good chance that I'm not. But both of

187
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,680
 these people's names is Esko. I swear to God, these guys were, it was a, there was an entire family

188
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,600
 of people who just named their kids after. They wanted their kids to be lackeys. That all aside,

189
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:27,280
 that all aside. So Esko, this Esko 2 we'll call him. And Peter, Petar, maybe P-E-T-T-E-R, Pet,

190
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,240
 Petar, Petar, we'll just call him Peter. Petar, sorry, Peter. This episode is going off the rails.

191
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,400
 There was also five minutes of just me clicking my mouse as I was having to look that stuff up.

192
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,600
 Peter and Esko 2 are hanging out. They're actually not hanging out. They're lumberjacks.

193
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
 They're doing their job. But the sky starts to get overcast and Peter turns to his lackey and says,

194
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,720
 "Job's done for the day. We can't keep cleaning up. We can't keep jobin' entries. That's your

195
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,920
 actual job. Let's start cleaning up." And Esko is like, "Yes, Master. We shall do that." And then

196
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,240
 Peter's like, "Silence." Esko 2 gets all shy and he's like, "Did I disappoint my Master?" Anyways,

197
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,720
 they start cleaning their stuff up, ready to go home. And so Peter's put away all the stuff. He

198
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,080
 has to shut down his chainsaw. I don't think it was running the whole time he was giving those

199
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,760
 orders, but he's holding his chainsaw and he sees out in the sky a disc-shaped object.

200
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:31,920
 And it has four little landing legs and they come out of the ship and

201
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,920
 lands. No big deal. It's just UFO flying around. Well, I mean, it's a big deal. To us, we hear about

202
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,000
 these stories all the time. But to Peter, he looks at this thing and he sees a circular door kind of

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,680
 open up on it. And Esko is still putting his stuff away. He doesn't see any of this, but Peter has

204
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,760
 the eyes of a hawk. He has the will of a hunter and the body of a lumberjack and he's watching all

205
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:04,640
 this stuff happen. And out of the UFO jumps a three-foot-tall alien. One piece green suit. Now,

206
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,440
 this one, the suit covers him up completely. The suit covers him up completely. Has a helmet on

207
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,840
 and has a faceplate like a scuba diver. Now, we have different descriptions of what the suit looks

208
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,640
 like. Conical helmet on the first one. The other guy is just described as having a helmet. This one

209
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,560
 has more of a rounded helmet because they drew pictures of what the dude looked like. Imagine

210
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,960
 for this story, you asked a four-year-old to draw a picture of an astronaut. That's what they look

211
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,800
 like. The suits are super bulky. There's no fingers visible. It's just basically like a giant

212
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,880
 marshmallow man that kind of has a rounded head and a little visor in the middle of it. So it's

213
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,080
 like a kid designed an alien and then that species goes, "That's a great suit!" and they built it.

214
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,840
 But we have the same height, the same color. We have no facial features and we they're wearing green.

215
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,600
 I already said that with the color, but you know they have the suit on. So we have three sightings

216
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,200
 over the course of about 11 months describing the same thing. Again, if they were faking it,

217
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,800
 they would all have the overalls and the pale skin from the first story. I think the fact that

218
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,040
 certain details are the same but others are different kind of lend credibility to that the

219
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,000
 story may be real. Anyways, Peter is standing there watching this little guy jump out of a spaceship.

220
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,040
 And he said that he moved mechanically but he thinks it was the limitation of the suit. He said

221
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,120
 the suit seemed to restrict the alien's movements. But what was odd was that he walked like an astronaut

222
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
 on the moon. So he said he would take a step and then he would kind of jump like softly three feet

223
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,200
 in the air and land. Then he would take another step and he would jump about three feet and land.

224
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,360
 And it was just kind of like this slow graceful, not necessarily graceful, but this slow walk

225
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,280
 across the force. So bounce, bounce, just kind of bounce into the force. It would look like it was

226
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,520
 a lot of fun if it wasn't an alien coming towards you. Otherwise you would say like, "Hey, can I

227
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,760
 borrow one of those suits?" But the alien is bouncing towards Peter very slowly, methodically,

228
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,320
 but is getting closer and closer. Esco has no idea any of this is going on until he hears the

229
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,560
 chainsaw start. So Peter as he's watching this three foot tall green dude bounce across the

230
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:30,320
 force silently towards him, he starts, starts of his industrial chainsaw, is there any other kind,

231
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,240
 and begins like revving it. And the alien is still bouncing towards him, bounce, bounce,

232
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,520
 and then he stops. And Peter standing there looking at him with the chainsaw revved up and the alien

233
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,640
 looks at him and slowly turns and starts bouncing back to his ship. Now he's moving fairly slowly

234
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,240
 because he's doing like these long graceful bounces. Peter starts walking towards him with

235
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,840
 the chainsaw, walking through the force, just smoking gas that gas smell that all those gas

236
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,120
 powered chainsaws put out just through the force. Esco at this point turns around real,

237
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,840
 sees this thing and begins following Peter. The chainsaw was enough to startle the alien to leave.

238
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,520
 The close encounter was over, but Peter continues to follow him through the force, just revving this

239
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,240
 thing the whole time, and starts like pointing it at him. So now he's like walking behind this alien

240
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,760
 who sees his ship in the distance and is taking a step, bounce, super slow, and then takes another

241
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,280
 step. It's basically a horror movie where now the villain is the human. This alien sees the ship

242
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,560
 in the distance and it's getting painfully close, but still it's such a slow journey. You hear a

243
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,120
 guy with a chainsaw moving through the force towards you. There's no doubt in my mind if Peter

244
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,320
 had started running. This would have ended very, very badly. But instead, at this point both Esco

245
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:05,280
 and Peter see other aliens in the ship and the ship starts to take off. So the alien's not there yet.

246
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
 You can see people and they'd be like "Hurry up man, get in the UFO, get in the UFO!"

247
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,480
 And the ship is starting to hover off the ground like it's getting ready to take off.

248
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,680
 And the alien is still not there yet, he's still taking those long jumps. And eventually the

249
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,480
 side door opens up on the side of the UFO and the alien goes to jump into the UFO.

250
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:37,600
 Peter grabbed the alien's heel and felt like hot iron on his hand. So he immediately let go and the

251
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,800
 pain was so intense that he was like "Ah, now just a pro tip, if you're holding a chainsaw,

252
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,960
 you probably don't want to hold it one-handed. Maybe not because I'm not a lumberjack,

253
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,440
 but I'm never going to chase someone with a chainsaw and then try to grab them at the same

254
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,640
 time. That just sounds like it's bad, but I guess if you're a lumberjack you can do stuff like that.

255
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 You have special abilities, you've put points in the attributes where you can use one-handed

256
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,080
 chainsaws. Anyways, he tries to grab the alien, he grabs its heel, he feels that horrible pain.

257
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:18,880
 The alien then is able to jump into the UFO, takes off. Now both Esco and Peter said that

258
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,320
 they wanted to leave, but they couldn't because they were both partially paralyzed and they had

259
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,400
 to wait an hour for the symptoms to leave and then they were able to get in their car and go home.

260
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,120
 So again, another interesting comparison to that first story, the partial paralysis.

261
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,640
 So that is the combined story known as the Mjärvi and Kanula alien encounters.

262
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
 Three different groups of people saw them over the course of 11 months,

263
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,440
 all pretty much describing the same creature. It may have been getting some fashion upgrades here

264
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,040
 and there and going from the overalls to a more fashionable puffy suit, but there's enough similarities

265
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,680
 between them that it's either true or everyone made up the same story, which is possible as well.

266
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,800
 But I think that last encounter shows why it was the last encounter. Aliens may want to buzz

267
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,080
 around and pull out boxes and shoot sparks at people, but when it gets real and you landed

268
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,920
 a lumberjack camp, the Finnish people do not mess around. And I think the rest of the world can

269
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,040
 take example from that. None of this "hey we come in peace, shake hands with aliens, learn

270
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,440
 to like balance crystals or alien religions" or whatever. Get a chainsaw, chase them down,

271
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,760
 don't touch them, but make them fear you. But let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now

272
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,520
 that story ran a lot longer than I thought it was going to. So this might be an extra long

273
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,640
 episode. Actually it might be an extra long episode because I've missed so many episodes

274
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,560
 on vacation. This will be the Finnish special. Finnish special. It's an extra long episode

275
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,840
 and all the stuff's about Finland. And this next story is funny. When I did the episode on the

276
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,320
 Finno-Korean hyperwar, I knew that I was going to get a couple people to make jokes about this.

277
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,280
 But the people that talked about this was on YouTube I had Mickey Knox,

278
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,560
 no Mallory, Mickey Knox, Zai Damoka, and then through Gmail I had a cartoon. And they all

279
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,640
 basically made the comment, "Finnolin doesn't exist." And now "Finnolin doesn't exist" is a very

280
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,920
 new conspiracy theory. There's very new conspiracy theory out there. And it's, origins are quite

281
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,520
 simple. It's actually an interesting theory because it's one that we can trace back the

282
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,640
 origins to it. We know who came up with it. Everything like that. It's more about the fact

283
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:50,960
 that this popped up in 2015 and people will say that it's true. It's a very, very recent conspiracy

284
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,960
 theory. But it touches on all the stuff we talk about when I say what makes up a good conspiracy.

285
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,560
 I think that was like episode 10 or 8 or something I did. You have time, you have distance, and you

286
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,960
 have a entity that we don't trust. If you have all three of those things that are a conspiracy

287
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,680
 theory, they're more likely to take off. So we're going back to the mid 20th century.

288
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:19,760
 And Russia realizes that there is this massive sea right at their borders that's full of fish.

289
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
 More fish than you could ever count in your life. Even Dr. Seuss cannot count all these fish.

290
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,920
 And they go, "You know what? Let's exploit this natural resource. We can do this, gentlemen.

291
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,400
 We have the technology." Someone goes, "Yeah, but we hate fishing. I know we hate fishing, but

292
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,240
 I know someone who loves fishing."

293
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,960
 Russia goes and knocks on Japan's door. Japan opens up wearing a little kimono.

294
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,560
 "Hey Japan, you love fishing, right? Yes, I love fishing."

295
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,120
 So Russia and Japan, who have always been friends and never engaged in any sort of warfare,

296
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,280
 for whatever point in this conspiracy, they're friends. Because they actually hate each other.

297
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,120
 But for this conspiracy to work, it requires you not to know anything about history or

298
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,720
 geography, Russia and Japan are friends, best friends. And so Russia goes, "Tell you what,

299
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,840
 we found the greatest fishing spot in the world." And Japan's just sitting there drinking coffee.

300
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,120
 The I heart Japan mug. "Yeah, tell me more, tell me more. I do love fishing." They go,

301
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,600
 "We found this premier fishing spot. Now we know that all the environmentalists, all the

302
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,360
 wackadoodle dudes are saying, 'You can't fish, Japan. You can't, you're over fishing stuff.

303
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,720
 You want to kill whales and stuff like that. We're going to monitor you. We're going to run our

304
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,160
 Greenpeace ships.' And Japan's like, 'Yeah, yeah, quite the headache, quite the headache. So tell

305
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,320
 me more about this fishing spot.'" Russia goes, "Not only can we give you access to this fishing

306
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,040
 spot, all we want is a portion of the fish because we're starving. It's 1950s. Communism is in full

307
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,000
 swing. We have no food." Japan's like, "Yeah, I didn't notice your pants were a little baggy,

308
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,920
 and you were wearing a potato sack for a shirt." And Russia's like, "Yes, it's harsh times,

309
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,960
 harsh times, but they will get better after communism falls." So anyways, Russia says,

310
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,200
 "There's this giant sea next to us, and you'll be allowed to fish there. No one else can fish there.

311
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,040
 You just have to give us a portion of the fish." And Japan goes, "Well, how do you, how will you

312
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,680
 guarantee no one else fish will ever fish there?" And Russia goes, "Because we're going to tell people

313
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,880
 there's no water there. We're going to tell people there is actually a country there, so if they know

314
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,360
 there is a country there, why would you go there to fish? Why would you bring boats there?" Japan's

315
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,040
 like, "Very, very interesting. Very, very interesting." And the way it worked out was they

316
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,600
 basically came up, Russia and Japan got together, and they came up with the name of the country,

317
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,680
 Finland, because secretly that's where they were getting fish from. It was a secret inside joke

318
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,480
 where whenever people talked about Finland, people would go, "Ah, yeah, yeah, they would know. See,

319
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,480
 it was a joke. Why else would you name a country Finland unless you were fishing there?" And,

320
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,560
 and I know your immediate question is, what about all the Finnish people? Wow, there are none,

321
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,040
 according to this conspiracy theory. If you live in Finland, you don't. You live in Russia.

322
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,560
 You just think you live in Finland. It doesn't exist. You might, if you live on the eastern

323
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,480
 border of Finland, you might live in Sweden. Oh, but now, see, now you're saying, won't it Sweden,

324
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,680
 one of the other neighboring countries be able to look out the window and see a vast ocean or sea

325
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,560
 to be more specific? Wouldn't they tell people, "No, no, no, there's actually water to fish there.

326
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,480
 There's not a country called Finland there. I'm on the border of a mass sea." Wow, because see,

327
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,560
 now we get into the global conspiracy. You see, Finland is often held up as the perfect ideal

328
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:51,840
 society with low crime rates and high education and all of these great values that socialists

329
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,560
 like to talk about. It's because no other, no other form of political party cares about education

330
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,200
 or crime, but the socialist Democrats of the world, the leftists, tell people that Finland exists and

331
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,280
 it's this perfect country because it uses socialistic attitudes and government practices and things like

332
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,680
 that. But it doesn't exist so no one can verify it. So they can go, "Oh, the greatest country in the

333
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,080
 world is Finland." They can say, "Finnland is the perfect socialist nation." You know, they can point

334
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,120
 to any government program they want to promote and say, "Well, it works in Finland, but you can

335
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,360
 never verify it because Finland doesn't exist." That's why they go along with the fact that Finland

336
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,040
 is real, that it's really part of a cover-up. It's a cover-up on the fact of Russia and Japan

337
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:44,080
 wanting to eat fish and it's a cover-up from the mainstream media, socialists, globalist elites,

338
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
 because they want to be able to point to Finland and say, "Your country could be as good as this

339
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,120
 country if you followed our rules." Oh, and I also should say part of this component is Nokia is

340
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,160
 Finland's biggest company and Nokia is owned by the Japanese. And this part I wasn't able to,

341
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,520
 well, I wasn't able to verify any of it because it's fake, but I also often see this,

342
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,760
 that Japan's the number one importer of Nokia phones, but Japanese in general don't use Nokia

343
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,840
 phones. I actually had to look into that because that's something I could verify. Nokia stopped

344
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,920
 selling phones in Japan in like 2008 and now they just buy up cell phone towers, cell phone networks

345
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,760
 and stuff like that in Japan and in China. So they still do have a big footprint there,

346
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,000
 they're just not selling phones. But anyways, the idea is that they're importing quote-unquote

347
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,600
 phones to Japan, but really is boxes of fish. So they set up this fake company in a country that

348
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,280
 doesn't exist, so when Nokia boxes are traveling through other countries, you don't know, I mean,

349
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,880
 obviously you'd smell the fish, you'd be like, "That's weird. Why is this Nokia phone? Why is it

350
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,840
 dripping wet? Why is this box dripping wet?" Also, the trans-Siberian railway was supposedly built

351
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,400
 to ship fish from Finland to Japan. Like, the whole thing is ridiculous, but it has so many

352
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:07,520
 components that are quote-unquote believable to someone who doesn't have basic working knowledge

353
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,120
 of geography or world history. I honestly think this conspiracy would be a little more believable

354
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,080
 if it didn't start off in the 1950s or like the early 1900s, because then you have stuff like

355
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,040
 in the history books, like the Finnish Empire, ancient Finnish warlords and stuff like that.

356
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,280
 But anyways, they say that's all made up, the powers that be are making it up, just like mud flood.

357
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,880
 This conspiracy theory is often brought up with stuff when we talk about mud flood, which is

358
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 something I've talked about multiple times. It's a theory where mud covered the entire

359
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,360
 planet in the 1800s and wiped out all these civilizations and historians are trying to

360
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,560
 cover that fact up, like mud covered up the world. People who believe in lost history a lot of times

361
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,640
 will buy into the fact that Finland doesn't exist, because it follows the same lines.

362
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,280
 Something that were told, happened, or exist didn't actually exist. So this one though,

363
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:06,160
 we have a start point of it. In 2015, there was this thread on Reddit where someone goes,

364
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,920
 "What's the one thing your parent told you that as you realized was stupid? Like, what's

365
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,400
 something that your parents told you when you were a kid that you realized was dumb?"

366
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,080
 And one guy goes, "Ugh, okay, you're not gonna believe this, but when I was a little kid,

367
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,680
 my parents told me Finland didn't exist. And he basically laid out the story that I told you."

368
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,800
 And it became a huge hit, and he said, he goes, "Yeah, my parents said that Finland doesn't exist."

369
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,000
 What it seems like now is that his parents were joking with him? Because he says

370
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,880
 that my parents do, later on he said, "My parents do believe that Finland exists."

371
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
 They laugh about it, that it's become so popular, but it was basically a,

372
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,880
 it most likely was a practical joke that her parents pulled on a little kid, and they probably

373
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,640
 just talked about it for a half hour. He said they were watching television and there was news

374
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,440
 report about Finland, and the dad goes, "Well, that Finland doesn't even exist." And the kid's like,

375
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,360
 "What do you mean?" And the dad started saying stuff, and the mom started saying stuff. And I mean,

376
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,000
 parents play practical jokes on kids all the time. So I think that's probably what happened. The dad

377
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,320
 was probably bored one day, and he saw an opening, and he saw how goable his kid was, and just kept

378
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,200
 going with it, and then forgot about it. And the next day he goes, "You do know Finland exists,

379
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,560
 right? Because it was just some stupid joke." And at some point he's probably figuring his

380
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,240
 kids smart enough to figure it out. But then, 10, 15 years later, his son goes, "Yeah, my dad told me

381
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
 that Finland doesn't exist." And then it becomes this huge meme, he goes back to his parents, and

382
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
 they go, "Oh no, we're just joking." They didn't remember saying that to him, they were just joking.

383
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,280
 So that's the origin of this thing. That's the origin of this thing. People today believe Finland

384
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,920
 doesn't exist. And I know that for a fact, because I've talked to people who believe that Finland

385
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,040
 doesn't exist. And now sometimes people will make jokes, and you're kind of like, "I don't know if

386
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,880
 you're joking, if you're just trying to troll me, or just trying to troll people on the internet,

387
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,360
 but then you'll meet people who you know they're not trying to troll at all. They are actually 100%

388
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,080
 believe that Finland doesn't exist." We have, as a society, gotten to a point where a father's

389
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,320
 joke to his son can convince 1% of the population of the planet. I know people are going to say that

390
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,520
 people are dumber. That's why people believe in this stuff, that we as a society, we as a species,

391
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,040
 have become dumber. And I don't believe that's the answer. I think it's the opposite. I think

392
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,960
 people have information overload. And the brain has a natural filtering process that when you're

393
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,280
 presented with all this information, we have access to the world's information, all the combined

394
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,440
 knowledge of humanity on our smartphone. And your brain just can't process that. And it basically,

395
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,880
 it has to work as a filter. Otherwise, you're just going to blow up. You can't constantly process

396
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,320
 all this information. And it's just like, you can look at everything. Your eyes pick up every

397
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,040
 single detail of the room you're sitting in right now. But your brain is only registering and only

398
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,240
 letting you remember certain details. Because otherwise, if I knew the color of the dish soap

399
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,400
 in my sponge and I knew which way my fossa was and I knew what date my calendar was and I knew

400
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,080
 all of what you should know the date on your calendar, but if I remembered every single detail

401
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,680
 in my room all day long, my brain would be overloaded. But my eyes register it, the information's

402
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,160
 in my head, but I don't have access to it. There is a filter in my brain. I think that's the same

403
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,720
 thing. I think that's why conspiracy theories are really, really taking off now. As opposed to

404
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,040
 30, 40 years ago, when it was relegated to a small section of a bookstore. We have so much

405
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,600
 information coming in every single day. We are having to filter out a bunch of information.

406
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,120
 And a lot of times, like my eyes are picking up all the stuff in the room, and my eyes and brain

407
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,640
 is a neutral thing. Don't know what's important or not as I'm just looking at a wall. If I'm looking

408
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,240
 for my poster of Kate Upton, I will, my eyes will go there and knows where it's at. And yes,

409
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,720
 I do have one. But, but if I'm thinking where's my broom, I then have to look for my broom.

410
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,760
 Even though my eyes and my brain know where my broom is because I've been looking at it

411
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,920
 all day long. It blinks that information. I don't need access to that information right now.

412
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,080
 And when it's filtering out information, sometimes it filters out good information,

413
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,080
 like Finland exists. And you remember all the stuff you learned about in high school,

414
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,640
 you start to filter out information. Your brain doesn't care if it's good information or it's

415
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,200
 bad information. It's just facts. It doesn't affect your daily life. I think it's information

416
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,800
 overload. And I think what happens is people don't trust experts or supposed experts, however you

417
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,960
 want to put it. They don't trust government institutions. They don't trust religious institutions.

418
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,800
 They don't trust institutions in general. So they have no source of reference. They trust

419
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,320
 individuals that they know quote unquote on YouTube or podcasts or whatever like that. They'll

420
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,200
 trust them because they seem like a friend. They're not a nameless corporation or an institution or

421
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,800
 anything like that. And that friend may have views that are not true. But just like if you're,

422
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,480
 we're hanging out with your real friend and they go, I don't like Pepsi, it's gross. You may go,

423
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,600
 yeah, I'm not a huge fan of Pepsi neither. Because you didn't really, you had no opinion on Pepsi

424
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,640
 before that conversation. You could take it or leave it. But when you have friends that go,

425
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,160
 oh no, Pepsi is totally disgusting. You're like, yeah, I really didn't care about Pepsi now.

426
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,800
 But now that my friends say it's gross, yeah, it is kind of gross. Because you didn't really care.

427
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,280
 This is the same thing with Finland. Who really even thought about who thinks about Finland other

428
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,600
 than people living in Finland or near Finland? So when someone says it doesn't exist, you go,

429
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 well, you know what, I never really thought about Finland before. But yeah, maybe it doesn't exist

430
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,800
 because it's coming from somebody you trust. And then we get into the problem of the echo chamber

431
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,680
 that once you've filtered out good information that makes you think that's a stupid thing to think.

432
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,720
 That's ridiculous. You filter out good information, you just accept all information good and bad as

433
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,040
 information. You can't, you've lost that ability to kind of go, that's not true. Because you're just

434
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,880
 overloaded. Your brain's overloaded. You can't decide what's good and what's bad is overloaded.

435
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,480
 You're talking to people who are saying that you trust, who are making statements that you really

436
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,360
 didn't care about beforehand. And now you're like, oh, they believe it. I didn't have opinion on it

437
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,960
 before. I'll just go along with him. And then you get stuck in the echo chamber where eventually

438
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,440
 you end up talking to people all the time. It came from the influencer. And now all of your friends

439
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,240
 think that Finland doesn't exist. You go out online, you start telling people Finland doesn't exist.

440
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,240
 Hundred people laugh at you, but one person goes, really? Because they didn't have an opinion on

441
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,600
 Finland anyways. They never thought about it. But someone they trust, i.e., you, not saying you

442
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:50,320
 personally, but the person who believes this stuff, they trust them. Absolutely bizarre world we live

443
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,560
 in right now. The internet interconnects us, it gives us access to all this information. And we

444
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,760
 are seeing some bizarre side effects of it. I don't necessarily see things getting better either.

445
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,320
 I think we're just, I think conspiracy theories are just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger

446
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,160
 to the point where eventually I believe you will start seeing conspiracy theories covered in the

447
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,920
 mainstream media as they are fact. If there's another terror attack, the, if there's another

448
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,000
 terror attack, the idea that it was an inside job is going to be the main story. I think we've just

449
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,480
 gotten to that point where people just question everything. There's a huge explosion in New York.

450
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,240
 The government tries to say it was Al Qaeda. There is going to be at least one major news network

451
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,280
 that is going to dig into it as if it was an inside attack. Mark my words. I hope there's not a

452
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,120
 terrorist attack, obviously. That's my prediction. I think we are at the stage where we are going to

453
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,960
 start seeing conspiracy theories go mainstream and actually become the theory.
