1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 A warning to all you animal lovers/hippie-dippy people out there.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:14,920
 A man--no, sorry, the star of the Matrix films has a bone to pick with the world.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,800
 And then we travel across America.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,080
 In the late 1890s, a series of airships, mysterious ships in the sky, were seen all over the country.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,920
 We're gonna take a look at some of the most interesting ones.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,920
 And yes, it's an interactive adventure, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,600
 [music]

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
 Happy New Year's. This is the official New Year's episode.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
 It is January 1st on the West Coast of the United States.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
 It doesn't matter where you live, this is all that matters.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,360
 It's January 1st here, so happy New Year's people.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,520
 We made it. We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,560
 Actually, before we get started, I've been pitching my Minecraft server for a while.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,080
 And a while back I said there was a secret hidden civilization out in the wilderness.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,840
 And it's been found by Flashman7870. So congratulations on that.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
 If you guys want to join the Minecraft server, it's totally awesome.

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
 You can chat, you can have fun.

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,760
 I am thinking though of starting everything over again and no protection.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,760
 So basically be anarchy. But we'll see. I won't be anarchy.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,040
 I'm gonna be your god, your floating creative god over the field, building whatever I want.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,800
 But I'm thinking about it. So hit me up in the comments, email, whatever.

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,640
 So, but I really like the Minecraft server.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,120
 I think it's the closest we're going to come to having some sort of discord-esque thing for a while.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,280
 Because this is far easier for me to mod than discord.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,200
 So that's just where we're at right now.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,440
 Let's go ahead and get started now with our first story.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,560
 Our first story is going to be really short, but it's important.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,080
 This vet is sitting there in his doctor's office doing some paperwork and stuff.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,160
 He's like, "I love my job. I love saving animals."

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,760
 Then all of a sudden his door gets kicked in.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,480
 And a dude comes in carrying a German Shepherd.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,760
 He throws it on the table and he goes, "Save my dog."

36
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,320
 The dog's like, "Oooh."

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,800
 Okay, just so the dog lives.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,320
 Okay, just cut to the chase.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
 Anyways, you don't know that yet.

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,400
 The doctor's like, "Uh-oh, we don't have time to get in the operating room.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
 Bring me my stuff here."

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,520
 And they cut him open on the desk.

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,520
 And they look, and the vet's like, "Hmm, there was an easier way to do this.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,640
 But the dramatic way is for me to cut this dog open and look.

45
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,360
 You're like, "I don't want to listen to this horrible podcast."

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
 The dog lives. The dog lives.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,280
 Okay, we're just building the narrative of the world's most intense veterinarian.

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,000
 The point, okay.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
 So let's forget that topic where a dog gets cut.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,680
 I don't know why I started with that.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
 Forget it. Forget it.

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,480
 This is the point of the story.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,440
 Dogs totally fine.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,520
 But a bunch of dogs aren't.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,120
 So apparently, dogs, this is where it gets depressing again.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,600
 Guys, you have to have the jokes before you get it.

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,840
 You have to give the sugar before you give the salt, right?

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,920
 Dogs are dying all over the United States.

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
 Some cats too.

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,800
 But it's not really the focus of this.

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
 Dogs dying everywhere.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
 I'm sure you've seen it on the news.

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
 Streets are littered with them.

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,120
 The reason why they're dying is actually very, very stupid.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,640
 Listen, if you want to be a vegetarian, vegan, whatever weirdo diet you want to be on,

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,880
 fine.

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,320
 But when it comes to like babies and animals,

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,360
 just feed them what they would eat in the wild.

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,600
 I.e., great value dog food from Walmart.

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,800
 Just feed them garbage.

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
 Not the kids.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
 Don't feed the kids that.

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,160
 But don't go out of your way to buy fancy,

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,840
 dancy foods for your pets.

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,080
 Because what has happened is that the FDA has said,

76
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,640
 listen, dogs are having heart attacks.

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,800
 And we, this is the reason why.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,760
 We don't know exactly which brands are causing this.

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,000
 But it's what they call "beg foods."

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,520
 Which is kind of ironic because that's what dogs do, to eat beg foods.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,640
 Boutique, exotic ingredients, or grain-free foods.

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,080
 So when you go and you spend $14 for a can of dog food,

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,160
 you feel like, oh yeah, dude, this is totally awesome.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,040
 This was made by like Sherpas and the Himalayas and

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,680
 carbon footprints negative five producing this stuff.

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,040
 It has these exotic ingredients, but it's killing animals.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 What happens is, there's an ingredient or a lack of ingredients in these foods

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,400
 that are making the heart wall of the dogs get thinner.

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,480
 And again, some cats, but they have tiny hearts anyways.

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,840
 I think they start off thin.

91
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,480
 The dog hearts get thinner and thinner and thinner.

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,760
 And then they die.

93
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,440
 It's the reverse of the Grinch.

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,600
 So the point of the story is, don't feed your dogs that stuff.

95
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
 Don't feed your dogs that stuff.

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,480
 The FDA is saying, this is their working theory.

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,680
 The dogs have a lack of taurine, you know, that stuff in energy drinks.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
 Dogs need that, humans might.

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,000
 That's why it gives you wings, but it gives hearts to dogs.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,560
 Don't, okay, do not feed your dog a Red Bull.

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,600
 But apparently, I'm sure the taurine is different.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,240
 But they know that these types of foods don't have this.

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,080
 When they started treating these animals with taurine, their hearts got better.

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,880
 And they said, listen, we know in big breeds of dogs,

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,640
 they have this heart disease thing.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,560
 It's called DCM or dilated cardiomath pathae.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
 Well, I'm not a veterinarian.

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,080
 Also, I think they do operations on their desk.

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,920
 That's another reason why I'm not a veterinarian.

110
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,400
 This is a genetic disease and sometimes big dogs have it.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,240
 But now like little Chihuahuas are having it, little dudes, and they're saying,

112
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
 there's no specific timeline.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,640
 So some dogs may be eating this food for years and years and years and their heart gets thin.

114
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,400
 And they go, we've seen dogs die in as soon as six months.

115
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,920
 You're like, Jason, this is a terrible way to start today's episode.

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
 And you're right.

117
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,400
 So we're going to move on to the next topic.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,560
 I just wanted to let you guys be aware that if you are some homeopathic voodoo weirdo out there,

119
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,720
 who's not feeding their dogs great value food from Walmart, or just buying it at the dollar store,

120
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,760
 I'm not saying that's healthier, but it honestly probably is.

121
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,080
 Because it's full of just pig scrapings and horse nostrils and all sorts of stuff

122
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,200
 that a dog needs to eat, apparently.

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,320
 They need grains.

124
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,360
 They don't need exotic ingredients or boutique foods.

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,680
 And I would argue humans don't either.

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,840
 Just eat stuff off the ground like a normal American human.

127
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,400
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

128
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
 Now, this one is weird.

129
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,520
 And I don't really even know how to like dig into it without giving,

130
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,840
 because this is halfway a dead rabbit recommends and halfway the look into the mind of a troubled man.

131
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,520
 Now, we all remember the movie "The Matrix."

132
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,920
 We all remember the American classic.

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,440
 And in "The Matrix," you had your star.

134
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,120
 And then you had the supporting cast, obviously.

135
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,920
 The star of that movie, really, was in "Kianohu?"

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,960
 "Kian-Hu?"

137
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
 Would have been a better joke.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,760
 But I didn't tell that one.

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,680
 Carrie O'Hurroway Boo.

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,960
 Lawrence Fishburn, more like Lawrence Fishsmell.

141
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,680
 Pewwee.

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,360
 The main star of that movie.

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,560
 The main star of "The Matrix" movie was Marcus Chong, aka Tink, the dude on the Nebuchadnezzar.

144
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,520
 Actually one of the only four remaining surviving characters from "The Matrix."

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,880
 Now, I remember when you saw "Reloaded" because I was peeking through the bushes.

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,560
 You were watching "The Living Room" and I was like, "Yes, enjoy the movie."

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,000
 I remember looking at you and seeing the disappointment on your face.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,200
 When you found out that Marcus Chong was killed offscreen, there would be no tank in "Reloaded" or "Revolutions."

149
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,120
 Humanity rose up and said, "M cat. M cat."

150
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,200
 That means Marcus Chong is tank.

151
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,240
 "M cat."

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,880
 I didn't make that up.

153
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
 We'll get to that in a second.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,640
 "M cat."

155
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,760
 The movies did not do as well financially.

156
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:17,800
 This all is the reality that is presented to you in the short documentary "Must See"

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
 the Marcus Chong story.

158
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,840
 It's on YouTube and this is the part that's a dead rabbit recommends.

159
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
 I really recommend you guys watching it.

160
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,560
 But why?

161
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,240
 Why am I asking you to spend 40 minutes of your time watching a self-made documentary

162
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,680
 about Marcus Chong not getting cast in the movie "The Matrix?"

163
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,640
 Because it is flat out bizarre.

164
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,560
 Here is the story.

165
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,960
 I'm going to keep this brief because I would like you guys to watch the documentary.

166
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
 It's fascinating.

167
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,800
 Marcus Chong was a young actor who did roles in like "Roots," the next generation that was a

168
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,160
 miniseries, it was a sequel to the seminal miniseries "Roots" starring LeVar Burton.

169
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,600
 He was in like some Broadway plays.

170
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,480
 He had done I think like "Little House on the Prayer" or something like that.

171
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
 He had done some television work, right?

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,600
 And then he gets cast to do the role of Tank in "The Matrix."

173
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,400
 And he, according to him, only got paid a couple hundred thousand dollars.

174
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,840
 And I know what you're thinking because I often think the same thing.

175
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,240
 That's fine, a couple hundred thousand dollars.

176
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,680
 But in the world of Hollywood, it's really not a lot of money.

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,920
 He finds out on the set that Joey Pants, the guy who played Cipher, the villain,

178
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,920
 got paid like a million or a couple million dollars and he went to the producers, the directors,

179
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,320
 the Walkowskis, goes up and says, "Hey, you know how come he's getting millions?

180
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
 I'm just gonna come on a thousand dollars."

181
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
 They didn't give him a car.

182
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,120
 He had to walk to the set each day.

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,240
 They gave him a hotel room.

184
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,600
 Like it really makes it seem like they were torturing Marcus Chong.

185
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,520
 And he has this idea too.

186
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,480
 So, back after, right after "The Matrix" was released,

187
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,120
 he begins filming a documentary about how the world is against him,

188
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,320
 specifically the producers of "The Matrix" and the directors, the Walkowskis.

189
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,840
 So, imagine having a bone to pick for 18 years.

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,840
 And that bone starting then and recording phone calls,

191
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,920
 recording phone calls with people to the point where you're talking on the phone

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,080
 and then you're holding your tape recorder up.

193
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,200
 That's how long ago this was.

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,160
 People were just using tape recorders up to the phone

195
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
 so you could get the other point of the conversation and then talking and then holding.

196
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 So, every, which is illegal in the state of California,

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,160
 the other person needs to know that they're being recorded.

198
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,200
 Because I used to be a journalist.

199
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
 I had a look and all that stuff.

200
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,880
 It's so amateurish that this person's trying to provide proof that he's being screwed over,

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,880
 but you miss the first five words of everything the other person's saying.

202
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:57,080
 Must see the Marcus Chong story is a bizarre descent into the world of one man who believes

203
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,320
 to this day that he was completely ripped off.

204
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,160
 But again, that's not the point of the story.

205
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,440
 That's not the point of the segment because that's just a guy.

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,160
 That's just a guy who has a business beef.

207
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,240
 What makes the story weirder is that it's basically in the end,

208
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,280
 because the Wachowski brothers ended up transitioning to the Wachowski siblings.

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,640
 They're two trans women now.

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,120
 Then the documentary basically, I don't want to say says that that's some sort of curse

211
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,080
 or some sort of madness that's been inflicted against the enemies of Marcus Chong.

212
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:43,080
 But the last five minutes of this documentary are jaw-droppingly weird.

213
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,360
 I was actually, I think it was with MythW on the Minecraft server.

214
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,720
 I was hanging out on there and I was talking to him,

215
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,480
 and I'm sorry if this is the wrong person, but I said you got to watch this documentary.

216
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,200
 And they watched it too.

217
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,160
 And when they got to the ending, they were like, what was up with that ending?

218
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,280
 And I'm like, it's weird.

219
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,680
 It's totally a bizarre little documentary because

220
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,720
 it's one man's point of view on this battle that you can go and look up any of this information.

221
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,880
 So maybe it did just turn out to be a dead rabbit recommend.

222
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,280
 But it does start to border in some really weird things at the end,

223
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,120
 where he's like a sexy, virile, young male, and cannery's dated a trans woman,

224
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,960
 and that's some sort of bizarre curse.

225
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
 And if you think that I'm reaching too much on that,

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,480
 he made a second little film that's also in the show notes

227
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,200
 that's set to the Twilight Zone music.

228
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,600
 And it's like, everyone who wronged me will be trapped on the Nebuchadnezzar,

229
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,680
 which is not how you pronounce it, it's Nebuchadnezzar.

230
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,360
 But all the souls who wronged me like cannery's will be trapped on the Nebuchadnezzar,

231
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,000
 floating through October 18, 2000 forever.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,040
 Their souls are trapped.

233
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,720
 So it's definitely some, there's definitely some weird stuff going on here.

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,040
 But I really recommend watching that movie.

235
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last topic.

236
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,040
 I talked way too long about Marcus Chong.

237
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,160
 Hey, that rhymed.

238
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,440
 Let's go ahead and get your numbers ready.

239
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,000
 We're going to do an interactive adventure on airships.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,040
 And I'm going to tell you right now, this episode's probably going to run a little long,

241
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,680
 but that's okay.

242
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,560
 It's our New Year's Day special.

243
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,400
 We're going back to the year 1896.

244
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,440
 We had a ton of airship sightings back then.

245
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,280
 They're basically the old timey version of a UFO sighting.

246
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,720
 We see metallic discs, lights shining, little grays walking around.

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,280
 They saw big old blimps, which is a curious thing.

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,600
 Now some of them, it did appear that they saw some sort of like metallic objects as well,

249
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
 but they never really go into the saucer thing.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 A lot of times these things are like big cigars or blimps with people on them.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
 Literal boats with blimps that are flying around.

252
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,200
 Now, I don't want to get into, we can do a totally different episode on that.

253
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,720
 I'm actually going to write that down as to why people saw blimps.

254
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,600
 I actually have a pretty good theory on that, but we're not going to talk about that.

255
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
 We're not going to talk about my interesting theory.

256
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
 We're going to talk about airships.

257
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,600
 So pick a number between one and five.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,520
 Okay, got it?

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,240
 Okay, let's go.

260
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,320
 First off, we're going back to the year 1896.

261
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:19,160
 This was actually the very first big airship sighting in America was on November 17th, 1896.

262
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,480
 It was in Sacramento, my hometown, Sacktown.

263
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,120
 Now, it's a couple days later, it's November 19th, 1896.

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,520
 We're going to the city of Stockton.

265
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,960
 Murder capital of the world.

266
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,240
 Even back then, old-timey people just getting shot doing old-timey meth.

267
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,000
 We're going to meet a guy named Colonel H.G. Shaw.

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,360
 He's riding in a buggy, which I'm pretty sure was a car.

269
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
 I mean, did it have horses?

270
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,080
 Did they have cars?

271
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,400
 I guess I probably should have looked that up.

272
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,600
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

273
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,320
 He's in some sort of wheeled vehicle, right?

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,760
 Could he just be, he could have just been running on the log for all I care.

275
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,000
 The point is, he's going down the road.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,360
 I'm assuming that's a car, because there's no horses mentioned in the story.

277
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,440
 And then, 150 foot long airship comes flying by.

278
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,200
 Whoa log, he steps off the log and it just moves a little bit more.

279
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,040
 That's how you break the log.

280
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,360
 He gets off and the ship descends down.

281
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,760
 Now, it's not like today when you're like, "Oh no, UFO, hit it!"

282
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,920
 And you're like going 90 miles an hour and the spacecraft's going 120 and you're like,

283
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,760
 "This is like you get off whatever vehicle you're in."

284
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,360
 And then the ship, I mean it's a blimp, right?

285
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,800
 It's a big old blimp.

286
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,600
 It's going to go slow, right?

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,800
 He's checking his watch.

288
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,280
 He's like, "Ah, better invent a watch."

289
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,760
 Invents it and he's like, "Oh yeah, still got a while."

290
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 And then he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

291
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

292
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

293
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

294
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

295
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

296
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

297
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

298
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

299
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

300
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the water."

301
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 And they grab him.

302
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 And this is considered the first published account of an alien abduction.

303
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 And he starts wrestling these guys.

304
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 And they're like, "I'm trying to pull them on the ship."

305
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 And then finally, "Ugh!"

306
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 He breaks free.

307
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 And that scares the aliens.

308
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 And they take off running.

309
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
 And you can imagine as they're running, they're like,

310
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 "Know it's a self.

311
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 Build a tractor beam or figure out a way to paralyze these guys."

312
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,800
 And then their descendants later were three foot tall,

313
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
 slender dudes, and they were like shooting dudes with paralyzing rays,

314
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 which is the grays we have today.

315
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 Now, if you picked number five,

316
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 you are driving down a road in Stockton.

317
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 And you have a big old, timey mustache in mutton chops.

318
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 Doesn't matter male or female.

319
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 You're totally ducked out in the old timey facial hair.

320
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 And you see a giant ship.

321
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 [imitates giant ship]

322
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 Slowly come down in front of you.

323
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 Aliens jump out.

324
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 It's the same ones.

325
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 They all got like fingerprint bruises on their arms from their last battle.

326
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 They're ready this time, though.

327
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 They just totally overpower you.

328
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 They bring a fourth one.

329
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 That's all they needed was one more.

330
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 You're like, "No, no.

331
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 If you pick number five, you are carried aboard the alien starship."

332
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 And, I'll give you something,

333
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 whatever item is directly to your left,

334
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 you're able to grab that before they throw you on the ship.

335
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,800
 So now you spend the rest of your possibly short life

336
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 wrestling seven-foot-tall aliens in a giant gladiator somewhere in space.

337
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 A carved-out asteroid full of old timey aliens.

338
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 They all have like barber poles and like canes and stuff like that.

339
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 'Cause even the aliens would be old timey, 'cause it's 1896.

340
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 And you get to fight aliens.

341
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 And maybe win.

342
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 Maybe you are plucky enough.

343
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 Maybe you're fit enough.

344
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 Maybe you just happen to have a shotgun to the left of you.

345
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 Aliens, we've never seen such technology.

346
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 We've only built Hyperdrive.

347
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 We don't know what a firearm is.

348
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
 So if you pick number five, that is your fate.

349
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 A fate of glorious combat in the alien arena.

350
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 Trust me, I think that's the best fate.

351
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 I would love to fight aliens.

352
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 I would just do it for free in real life.

353
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 I would box aliens, dude.

354
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 And I think that's why I've never seen one.

355
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 I've seen tons of ghosts, seen a couple demons,

356
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 seen some weird stuff, never seen an alien.

357
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 I think it's because even a good one, I'm just going to town.

358
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 I'm going to town.

359
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 Speaking of abductions, I just got abducted to go to work.

360
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 I'm finished recording this episode a couple hours later.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 It's 9, about 9.30 at night.

362
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 Huge storm going on.

363
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 Nice and spooky for the rest of our episode.

364
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 Let's go back to my notes.

365
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 Let's go grab those first before we continue our adventure.

366
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 So we leave behind Stockton, California.

367
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 And we leave all the number fives there.

368
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 You have to shut off the episodes.

369
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
 You can't listen to anything.

370
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 You can't until you defeat 10 alien warlords.

371
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 You can't listen to the rest of the episode.

372
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 But for the rest of us, we're leaving behind Stockton, California.

373
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 We're headed to somewhere in Texas.

374
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 This is your 1896, 1897 Supervague, I know.

375
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,800
 But that's the least of the problems with this story that we're about to go.

376
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 We're somewhere in Texas.

377
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 Bing!

378
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 We're standing around.

379
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 We're in the middle of nowhere, which is pretty much describes most of Texas.

380
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 Especially back in the year 1896.

381
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 And this is the story with this one.

382
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 There are these three dudes hanging out in a field.

383
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 And they see an airship.

384
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
 Flying overhead.

385
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 And they're like, "Oh, look at this. One of those new fangle devices we read about in the newspaper."

386
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 They're pointing up in the sky.

387
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 And it goes...

388
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 And it starts to crash towards them.

389
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 They're like, "Ahh!"

390
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 And it's like coming closer and closer.

391
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 And they're like, "Oh, run! Where do we run to? We're in the middle of nowhere.

392
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 That's a giant ship flying towards us."

393
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 So they scatter.

394
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 But really they don't.

395
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 Okay, so my narrative version.

396
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
 Let's go back.

397
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 Let's say what actually happened.

398
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 I started making it all dramatic.

399
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 One guy's like running his sweat and the other guy's like saving a baby that's just standing there.

400
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
 "Run, run, run!" picks the baby up, keeps going.

401
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 That's not what happened.

402
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 The actual version of the report is...

403
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 Okay, what is that?

404
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 I got my notes mixed up.

405
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 I got my notes mixed up.

406
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 The crashing story comes later.

407
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 This is what actually happened.

408
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 Now this one's going to be even funnier.

409
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 Because of what I just built up.

410
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
 That's not what happens.

411
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 In Texas in 1896, three witnesses are standing around.

412
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
 And the ship goes...

413
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 [imitates ship noises]

414
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 It just lands and doesn't impact the ground at all.

415
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 And the three men are kind of standing there.

416
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 Now if you picked number one,

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 BING!

418
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 You're one of those three men.

419
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 You're just standing there and you're looking around at this spacecraft.

420
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 This vehicle from another world has landed in front of you.

421
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 And you're like, "Well, golly! Look at that thing!"

422
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 And some aliens get off of it, but they're not...

423
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 Well, technically they're aliens, but they look like humans.

424
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
 There's five of them.

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
 So five humans depart from this airship.

426
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 They're described as particularly dressed men.

427
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 So these five dudes get off the ship.

428
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 And you figure in, "Okay, there's three of us.

429
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
 There's five of them.

430
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 If this becomes a fight, odds are not in our favor."

431
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 However, I did hear about a guy in Stockton who beat up three giant dudes.

432
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 I think we could take these five dudes.

433
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 But really, you're not really thinking about beating these guys up,

434
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 because you're not insane like I am.

435
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 You're thinking, "This is first contact."

436
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 I'm going to be one of the first humans to ever talk to someone from another planet.

437
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 These aliens walk up to you and begin speaking perfect English.

438
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 How do you know English?

439
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
 And they say, "Well, that's a good question."

440
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 You see, back in 1553, one of your so-called explorers came to the North Pole.

441
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 He spoke English.

442
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 And he taught us we're from there.

443
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 And you're thinking, "Santa?"

444
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 And you're like, "No, no, no, not Santa."

445
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 Even more intriguing than Santa.

446
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 These five men then go on to tell you that they're actually the descendants of the lost tribe of Israel.

447
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 So when Israel was split up, when they were just getting demolished back in olden times,

448
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 and the 12 tribes separated across the planet,

449
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 apparently one of the tribes went to the North Pole and built spaceships.

450
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 So if you pick number one, you meet these dudes, these guys who say they're from Israel,

451
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 like thousands of years ago, now they have a spaceship.

452
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 And you're like, "That's interesting.

453
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 Okay, but that is as interesting as it gets.

454
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 I'm going to leave."

455
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 And as you go to leave, they use their tractor beam technology, what we call a rope,

456
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 and they throw it over you, the last so you they pull you into the ship.

457
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
 You're like, "No, no, no."

458
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 For the rest of your short life, no, they're going to give you injections.

459
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 So they're going to make you a cyborg, so you live hundreds of years.

460
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 You are going to travel the universe with them.

461
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 You're like, "Jason, that's awesome."

462
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 But you're basically the space age equivalent of a Jehovah's Witness,

463
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 where you just have to fly through space and then like, you get in a space suit

464
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 and you're knocking on the doors of other spaceships.

465
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
 And you're like, "Can I tell you about the good word?"

466
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 And they're like, "No, no one's here.

467
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 No one's spiraling in the ship now.

468
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 This is AI controlled.

469
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 This is the voice of a robot.

470
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 Everyone's in cryogenic sleep."

471
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 And you're like, "Aww."

472
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 And then you're like floating back to your ship and you turn around.

473
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 And you see aliens like looking through the portholes.

474
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 Is he gone yet?

475
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 Is he gone?

476
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 That is your fate.

477
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 Your fate is to join these five men travel through the galaxy

478
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 trying to missionary to people about you being the lost tribe of Israel.

479
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 For the next one, we're going to an unknown location.

480
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 Year unknown as well.

481
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 Now, it's not because my notes are bad.

482
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 It's because this just appeared in an old-timey newspaper.

483
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 But we're going to assume the story's legit as we travel to unnamed city USA.

484
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 Population, what?

485
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 The picture is population.

486
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 There's a picture of a guy just dragging his shoulders.

487
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 Two dudes are hanging out in a field.

488
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 You're like, "Jesus, seriously?

489
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 How big are these stories?"

490
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 Two dudes.

491
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 Don't interrupt me.

492
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
 Two dudes are hanging out in a field and they see an airship.

493
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 Yeah, basically at this point, I think I can just cut that part out.

494
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 It's always going to be the same.

495
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 Anyways, but this airship, this is the one I got mixed up.

496
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 This airship, it's crashing. It's exciting, isn't it? Whoa, we got to run. Look out.

497
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 You're afraid people are going to start throwing like religious texts out of the ship.

498
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 But they're not.

499
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 The ship's getting closer and closer.

500
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
 And then a guy standing in front of you.

501
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 He's like, "What? What intonation was that?

502
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Where'd that magical ship go?"

503
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 And the pilot, apparently, I mean, if we assume this story is true, this is what happened.

504
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 The ship was about to crash in front of these two dudes.

505
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 And then there's just a guy standing in a field in front of him.

506
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 And the guy goes, "Well, he's an alien. He looks like a normal human,

507
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 but the assumption is he's some sort of alien, not from around here."

508
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 He's like, "Italian."

509
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 So the people go, "Dude, what happened? Your ship just crashed and then you're standing there?"

510
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 And he goes, "No, no, no, no, no. The ship didn't crash."

511
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 And they're like, "But we saw it coming towards the earth."

512
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 He goes, "Yeah, yeah, that was all true."

513
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 And the thing that happened was, right before it impacted the ground,

514
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 I pulled out a shrink ray, shot the ship I was piloting, and then put it in my pocket.

515
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 Now, I swear I didn't make that story up. Somebody probably did, but I didn't.

516
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 That was in some old-timey newspaper.

517
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 Two guys said that they saw a ship and right before it crashed,

518
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 there was a guy standing there and he says he had a shrink ray.

519
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 That might honestly be the dumbest story I've ever told over the course of 300 and what?

520
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 63?

521
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 There are 64 episodes on this show.

522
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
 There's so many things wrong with that story.

523
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 The main thing being, and I'm not a big science guy,

524
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 but if a ship is crashing and then you shrink it, you put it in your pocket.

525
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 One, let's say the ship is traveling 20 miles an hour,

526
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 and then you shrink it and put it in your pocket.

527
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 It's going to go 20 miles per hour through your pocket.

528
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 So it's basically going to destroy your pants.

529
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,800
 But really, the thing is, is that as it's coming down and you shrink it,

530
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 now you're falling still at 20 miles per hour,

531
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 and you're putting something in your pocket that's 20 miles an hour,

532
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 which is a combined force of 40 miles per hour.

533
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 It would be like a slow train crash happening in your pocket.

534
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 And you're like, "Jason, you're getting really hung up on this shrinking ray thing."

535
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 I am, because there's another problem I have with this story,

536
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 and it's really how it ends.

537
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 That way, imagine you're standing out in the fields,

538
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 and you see a spaceship, imagine it's today,

539
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 and you see a spaceship crash in front of you.

540
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 All of a sudden there's an alien standing there with his arms crossed

541
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 in some boy band pose, and he's like,

542
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 "I bet you're wondering what happened to my spaceship."

543
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 And you're like, "Yes, I'm a little curious about that."

544
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,800
 He goes, "Well, I shrunk it and I put it in my pocket."

545
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 Then what happens?

546
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 That's what's so bizarre to me about this story.

547
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 One, the physics of it, but two, okay, and...

548
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 If somebody told me the story, and I've had people tell me some weird stories,

549
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 like face-to-face and email even weirder stories,

550
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 if someone told me the story in my first question,

551
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 I wouldn't be talking about pocket physics.

552
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 I'd be going, and then what happened?

553
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 Did he just turn and walk away? Did he blow the ship back up?

554
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 Then what happened?

555
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 It's probably the most puzzling thing,

556
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 because there's no acceptable ending,

557
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 because he either goes, "Oh, I just wanted to show off my new technology,

558
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 makes the ship grow back up and flies away in front of these two dudes,"

559
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,800
 or doesn't, which is even weirder,

560
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 because then he's just walking around with a spaceship in his pocket.

561
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 "Oh, I'm just headed to the saloon."

562
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 What? Why did you flay into the middle of a field?

563
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 Why did you-- You didn't even have to do that!

564
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 So bizarre. So if you picked

565
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 number two, your best friend is an alien.

566
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 Whoa, that's cool.

567
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 And he has the shrink ray spaceship,

568
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 but he's constantly like,

569
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 "Hey, you want to go to Taco Bell?"

570
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
 You're like, "Yeah, sure. You want me to drive?"

571
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 He's like, "No, no, no, I'll drive."

572
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 He flies around in a blimp, a super slow blimp.

573
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,800
 And then right where he goes or he wants to go,

574
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 he dive bombs the parking lot,

575
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 and right before you hit the ground,

576
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
 he shoots the shrink ray and throws the ship in your pocket.

577
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 So basically, whenever you want to go somewhere,

578
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
 you take a 40-mile-per-hour punch in your thigh.

579
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 "Ugh!"

580
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 He's like, "Aw, I forgot my wallet at home.

581
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 Let's get back in the vehicle."

582
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
 You're like, "No, no, no."

583
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 Flying around.

584
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 So I guess that's not a bad fate.

585
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 You just get punched a lot.

586
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 What else did we have earlier?

587
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 Oh, intergalactic missionary and gladiator.

588
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 So there you go.

589
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 You get punched in the leg all the time.

590
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 And you can't take the ship, can't steal a ship,

591
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 can't steal a shrink ray.

592
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 You can't be like, "So, there you go.

593
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 Get punched."

594
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 I honestly think, I'm sure there's at least one physicist

595
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 who listens to this show.

596
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 I honestly think it would do more than a 40-mile-per-hour punch.

597
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 I think reducing a giant airship and throwing it into your pocket,

598
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 just the mass of the airship alone will probably rip your leg off.

599
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 But until I get a comment or an email from a physicist,

600
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 you just walk around with the bruise.

601
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 I will update this podcast if I later find out it will shred meat and bone

602
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,800
 if you get hit with a miniature airship goes into your pocket.

603
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 Let me know, people at NASA or MIT.

604
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next one.

605
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 So we've left behind the ones and the twos.

606
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 Number one is they're out doing their holy mission in space.

607
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 Number two, rubbing their leg.

608
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 Oh, my leg.

609
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 We've got a per minute Charlie horse.

610
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,800
 Because it's like, let's go on a road trip and we're going to stop at every diner we see.

611
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 No.

612
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 The rest of us were going to Springfield, Missouri.

613
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 April 10th, 1897.

614
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,800
 We got an actual place and a date for this one, so that's good.

615
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 WH Hopkins is hanging out on the ground and he sees a landed airship.

616
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
 So it's not floating around.

617
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 So you're like, isn't it just the ship?

618
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
 Isn't that just a land ship?

619
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 Well, it had like the blimp thing.

620
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 Had these giant propellers and he's walking up to the ship and he's like,

621
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,800
 curiouser and curiouser.

622
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,800
 Going to take a look at one of these airships that I've read about in the news.

623
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 So he's walking up the ship and then he sees the crew.

624
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 He sees a beautiful naked woman walking along the ship.

625
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 She looks at him, kind of gives him heads up like, yeah.

626
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 Doesn't blush, doesn't run away.

627
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 And then another beautiful naked woman appears walking along the ship.

628
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 And then there's more.

629
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,800
 There's just a bunch of beautiful naked women on the ship and at this point,

630
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
 he has like the equivalent of an old timey erection.

631
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 I'm sure they were the same, but they just like would also be accompanied with like the whiff of sasperilla.

632
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,800
 And he's walking along and he's seeing all these beautiful women.

633
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 And then he sees a naked dude with a beard show up and he's kind of like,

634
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 like it didn't do.

635
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 He's not into that.

636
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
 He starts asking them questions.

637
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 He goes, where are you from?

638
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
 Now that's stupid.

639
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 Like obviously I get it.

640
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
 Maybe he's hoping they'll take him home to a place of more beautiful women with their own airships.

641
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 But if I saw, but there's two different things here.

642
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 Obviously, like if I saw a UFO in the middle of nowhere, I'd be like,

643
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 Oh my God, like is this from an alien planet?

644
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 Like where are these guys from?

645
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 If I saw a UFO and was surrounded by beautiful naked women, I'm not worried about where the aircraft is from.

646
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 That's the least of my worries.

647
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 My question is, hey, what's your name?

648
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 You have a phone number?

649
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 Snapchat?

650
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 Like I'm not, and you guys may think, oh, Jason's just doing a bit.

651
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 I challenge you that if you walk in the middle of the spooky, spooky woods and you saw a UFO in a clearing and it was surrounded by the most beautiful women,

652
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
 what are your eyes going to be drawn to?

653
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 Is it going to be drawn to the craft that can cut through space and time like an angel's whisper?

654
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 Or are you going to be checking out all the hot chicks?

655
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 It's completely, I would not ignore the UFO, but I'd be focused on the girls.

656
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 But anyways, this guy apparently goes, where are you from?

657
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 And they can't really talk English.

658
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
 They weren't hanging out at the North Pole.

659
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 Apparently these people, they just pointed up and said a word that Hopkins said sounded like Mars.

660
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
 Now that's the end of his story.

661
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:36,800
 And unlike the shrinking story, I think more stuff, I think the shrinking story just kind of ended and then everyone just kind of stood there awkwardly for a couple of minutes and then they just turned around and walked in different direction.

662
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 This story, I think he probably like stuck on board the ship.

663
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:50,800
 He's like, he knocks out a guard and then has to like imitate him, but instead of like putting on his uniform, he just takes all of all of his clothes and he's just walking around.

664
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,800
 And he's like drilling holes in the side of the ship and looking through it like it's a porcupine movie.

665
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 They're like, no, no, you've depressurized the room.

666
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,800
 People are blowing up as they leave orbit.

667
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,800
 They're like, they find all these people that he made in it and the ship just decompresses.

668
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
 But anyway, so they never make it back to Mars.

669
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
 Anyways, that's the story of Hopkins.

670
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 So if you picked the number three, you get a pair of binoculars, right?

671
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,800
 And you are a hundred miles away from all this and you get to look through the binoculars and you see a ship land in the middle of nowhere.

672
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 You see a bunch of sexy, sexy women walking on the ship and you're like, oh man, I totally wish I could get on that ship.

673
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 You're looking through your binoculars.

674
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
 You're like, oh man, this sucks.

675
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 And then you feel a hand, a tentacle on your shoulder and it says, oh yes, if you want to get close, I am friends with the captain.

676
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
 I'm also an alien, hence the tentacle.

677
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
 I am friends with the captain of that ship.

678
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,800
 You come with me and I will let you walk around on the Nekipo, right?

679
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
 And so you go with the tentacle.

680
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 It's just a giant tentacle.

681
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
 You turn around, it's just a tentacle.

682
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 There's nothing else with a mouth, tentacle with a mouth.

683
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 So you go with the tentacle and but you realize you're going in the opposite direction.

684
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
 You also realize that the tentacle is driving like a 1988 Dotson.

685
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 You're like, this is weird. Where's your spaceship?

686
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
 The tentacle is like, it's in the shop.

687
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
 My real spaceship is in the shop and it's like driving.

688
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,800
 You're trying to figure out how a tentacle with just one tentacle can drive and both hit the gas, but it's working.

689
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,800
 And the car is just driving farther and farther away from the ship and you're like, oh, it's getting kind of sketchy.

690
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
 And then the tentacle drives you out to the middle of the woods.

691
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
 And you're like, what? This is not good.

692
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
 And tentacle is like, no, no, no, it's fine.

693
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,800
 And so it takes you into a cave and you're like, huh?

694
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,800
 Takes you into a cave and you go into the cave and then the tentacle is like, no, deeper, deeper into the cave.

695
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,800
 And so you go deeper into the cave and then you get knocked on the back of the head with like a mallet.

696
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 It was holding a mallet the whole time.

697
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,800
 You were never suspicious until now.

698
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
 It was like a giant Donkey Kong mallet.

699
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
 You never questioned it.

700
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 Knock. And then when you wake up, you are on the naked ship.

701
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 He told you the truth.

702
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 He told you the truth.

703
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:18,800
 You're on the naked ship, but you're a space missionary.

704
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,800
 So you're in a little business suit on the ship.

705
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 You don't even get to be naked.

706
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
 And everyone else is walking around you naked.

707
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 And they're like, you going to travel.

708
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 We've teamed up with these guys from the North Pole.

709
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
 We've all converted, but we're naked.

710
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
 That's our species.

711
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 We're just beautiful naked people.

712
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,800
 You are just some space ministry guy.

713
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 We're going to travel the galaxy and you're going to deliver the good word.

714
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,800
 You're going to knock on spaceships and deliver the good word that glip glop is your savior.

715
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
 You're like, I don't even believe in glip glop.

716
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,800
 And that's when you get your first electric shock.

717
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 It's an electric shock.

718
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,800
 It feels like a tentacle goes down your throat and expands a white hot tentacle.

719
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 And that's when you realize that every time you look at one of these beautiful women,

720
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 or if you're into it, the beautiful dude, and you start to like feel like you're in love with them,

721
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 this tentacle, this white hot tentacle explodes in your throat and it hurts really, really bad.

722
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,800
 So that is what happens if you pick number three.

723
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,800
 That's also what happens when you don't pre-play out what happens to if you pick number three.

724
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
 That was all just kind of off the top of my head.

725
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
 I didn't even know where I was going with it when they walked into the cave.

726
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
 I was thinking, uh-oh, where's this going?

727
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
 Am I just going to edit all this out?

728
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
 No, I'm not.

729
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
 You know what, actually, that's not fair.

730
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
 That's not fair.

731
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,800
 You, after about a couple of days, the tentacle leaves your throat and you can bang one of the hot people on the ship.

732
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,800
 You're still a minister, you're still going to knock on spaceships, because that's funny.

733
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:05,800
 But eventually the tentacle releases you from the tentacle curse and you can find true love as opposed to those boring people who pick number one.

734
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
 So I figured, there we go, there we go.

735
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
 I should plan these out better.

736
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,800
 Now we're headed to probably one of the most famous airship stories.

737
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:24,800
 I was actually talking to Flashman7870, you know, he was the Minecraft guy, but I was talking to him about this episode and he's like, "I really don't like that story."

738
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 Because he goes, "It's kind of famous. I'm pretty sure it's been debunked."

739
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
 It's actually quite a fascinating story and it really hasn't been debunked.

740
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
 So you're wrong.

741
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
 Flashman, you're wrong.

742
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 No.

743
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,800
 So if you picked one, if you picked any number other than four, your fate has been sealed.

744
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
 Shut the podcast off now.

745
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
 I never want you guys to listen to it again.

746
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
 However, number four, come with me.

747
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
 Come over here.

748
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 It's you and me, buddy.

749
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,800
 It's you and me, at least until the end of this segment, and then you are banished from the podcast as well.

750
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
 It's April 17th, 1897.

751
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,800
 We're in the city of Aurora, Texas.

752
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
 It's a sleepy little town, but it's 6 a.m.

753
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
 And oddly enough, everyone's awake.

754
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 And in the town square, everyone's just kind of going about doing their thing.

755
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 There's some chick talking about reading books and wanting to have a better life than she has.

756
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
 Everyone's ignoring her.

757
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
 She's just being a weirdo.

758
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,800
 Everyone else is just carrying eggs around or making bread and stuff like that.

759
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 And up in the sky, you see this...

760
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
 [imitates airship]

761
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 This airship coming down, right?

762
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 And it's a bunch of smoke is spewing out of it.

763
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
 Now, I like it.

764
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 This story has the most detail of all.

765
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 This airship was described as going the impossibly fast speeds of 10 to 20 miles per hour.

766
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,800
 Which is funny because that would be nothing nowadays.

767
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,800
 Like, obviously, if someone was throwing a brick at you going 20 miles an hour, it's a lot.

768
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
 But that's nothing.

769
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,800
 But back then, to see something go 10 to 20 miles per hour, you'd be like, "What in the world is that?"

770
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 Because you didn't go that fast unless you were on a particularly fast train.

771
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
 Or maybe like, you were the lone ranger or something.

772
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 For the most part, people didn't go that fast.

773
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
 So they're watching this ship come down 10 to 20 miles per hour.

774
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 They're like, "Whoa, dude, look out! It might break the sound barrier!"

775
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
 "What's the sound barrier?"

776
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
 "I don't know, but it's so fast!"

777
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 It's... [imitates airship]

778
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
 It smashes into a windmill.

779
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
 [imitates airship]

780
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
 It hits the ground, just starts to disintegrate.

781
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
 Pieces are going everywhere.

782
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
 Everyone's running out of the town, running towards this debris pile.

783
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
 And there they find...

784
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
 ...little alien dude.

785
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
 An actual alien, supposedly.

786
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
 Not a man.

787
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
 Like, they were looking and they said he was not of this world.

788
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
 He's like...

789
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 [imitates airship]

790
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 "Have you accepted our Lord and Savior, glip glop?"

791
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 No, he didn't say anything.

792
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
 He didn't say anything.

793
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
 They come across a dead alien.

794
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
 They did, though, say, "Well, this guy's obviously like toast.

795
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
 He's all chopped up.

796
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,800
 Let's put him in a grave and let's give him a Christian funeral."

797
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
 Because that's what we would hope if we crash landed on another planet.

798
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
 I don't have you actually.

799
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
 I don't think you were thinking that far ahead.

800
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
 I think they just saw a dead thing, a dead humanoid.

801
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
 He said, "Let's give it a funeral."

802
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 "We'll do a Christian funeral."

803
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 So they bury it.

804
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
 They give it a little tombstone.

805
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
 They bury some of the debris of the ship in his grave.

806
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
 And the rest of it, they're like, "What do we do with this stuff?"

807
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
 And they go, "I just throw it in the well."

808
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,800
 So they started throwing this space-aged metal in a well.

809
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
 People were like, "Yeah, that's fine.

810
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 It's not going to affect our drink and water at all, right?"

811
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
 That story came out.

812
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,800
 That happened in April 17th, 1897.

813
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,800
 It was reported in the Dallas Morning Star, I believe,

814
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,800
 at the Dallas Morning Times Road, two days later.

815
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
 And it was a big hit.

816
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
 People in the area were like, "Whoa, dude, UFO crashed."

817
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
 But what?

818
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,800
 I mean, we were having the-- as we've already shown,

819
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,800
 we were having these airship sightings all over the United States.

820
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
 So it didn't get a lot of publicity outside of the area.

821
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,800
 We'll jump ahead to the year 1935,

822
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
 and there was a guy named Brawley Oates,

823
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
 who bought the property that the spaceship landed on.

824
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
 He didn't buy it because there was a spaceship on it.

825
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
 It's just good land.

826
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
 And he goes, "You know what?

827
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
 I want to start using that well.

828
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
 I want to start using that well."

829
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,800
 So he hauls up all the metal, gets rid of it,

830
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
 and gets terrible arthritis, which he always blamed

831
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
 was caused by the spaceship debris.

832
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 Now, a lot of people say that this story is debunked.

833
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,800
 Like I said, Flash Man was saying that it was debunked.

834
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
 And the reason why they say it was because Time Magazine

835
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,800
 ran an article on it saying this story wasn't happened.

836
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,800
 What happened was the author of the original article,

837
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,800
 there was a disease going through town,

838
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
 like spotted fever or something like that,

839
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
 and a bunch of residents were getting killed.

840
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
 There was supposed to be a train track that was built by the town.

841
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
 It didn't get built.

842
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
 So all of the resources, commerce,

843
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 was getting diverted to other towns,

844
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
 plus they were having this horrible illness.

845
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,800
 And he wanted to build publicity for people to come to visit Aurora, Texas,

846
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
 and live there.

847
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
 And they would come there if there was a spaceship crash.

848
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
 Now, there's a couple things that we have to look at of the story.

849
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
 One, there's only one source for that story.

850
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,800
 It's an 86-year-old woman named Edda Peggs.

851
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,800
 She said, the author of the article was Essie Hayden,

852
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
 and the newspaper was the Dallas Morning News.

853
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,800
 And she said, he made it up.

854
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,800
 He made it up because he wanted to get people to come to town.

855
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,800
 So the whole debunking thing is based on that one person story.

856
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
 Two, you have to be a special type of jerk

857
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,800
 to know that a horrible disease is sweeping your town

858
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
 and then tricking people to come to your town.

859
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,800
 Like, I can understand a disease is ravaging your town

860
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,800
 and you're trying to, like, do a straight return of the living dead,

861
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,800
 send more doctors moment to get medical personnel.

862
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,800
 But if there's people, back in the day, people who studied this,

863
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
 because you know today we have UFOologists,

864
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,800
 back then they were called airshipologists, which is hilarious.

865
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,800
 Imagine you're an airshipologist.

866
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
 You have your monocle and you're drinking your tea.

867
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,800
 And you see in the newspaper, hey, look at the UFO crash in Aurora.

868
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
 I can't wait to go find it and you go out there.

869
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,800
 And there's just a bunch of people dying on the streets.

870
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
 You're like, oh no, the aliens have caused this biological weapon.

871
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
 But that's kind of a jerk move,

872
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,800
 because you're really not going to get a bunch of people to come.

873
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,800
 And the people that come, you know, they're just there to investigate aliens.

874
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
 They're not there to cure your horrible diseases.

875
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,800
 But anyways, a bunch of people didn't come to the town.

876
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,800
 It didn't really start to take effect until after Roswell.

877
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,800
 That's when Aurora, the people were digging up this old story back from 1897.

878
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,800
 The other thing about the debunking of it is that other people have investigated it since.

879
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,800
 Now this next part of the story happens from MUFON,

880
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,800
 which is the mutual UFO network.

881
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,800
 They basically are doing all these investigations.

882
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,800
 They teamed up with a television show called UFO Files.

883
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
 And they go out to Aurora, Texas.

884
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,800
 They interview people and people who are still alive.

885
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
 They were kids back then.

886
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,800
 They're like, oh, I didn't directly see it, but my parents, they talked about it all the time.

887
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
 Like, this one person says, I wasn't allowed.

888
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,800
 I remember seeing the crash, but I wasn't allowed to go to the debris.

889
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 But my parents did and they said they saw the alien.

890
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,800
 Secondhand stories from much 80-year-olds.

891
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
 People are still saying it's true.

892
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,800
 Now there's a plaque in town, which says it's a legend,

893
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
 but the towns people were saying it was true.

894
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,800
 And MUFON and UFO Files, they found a gravestone marker.

895
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
 That's all worn out. It's from 1897.

896
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
 Their investigation was in 2005.

897
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
 So this is past just more than 100 years.

898
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,800
 They find a gravestone marker that appears to have a picture of what looks like a flying saucer.

899
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,800
 But they can't be sure. It's just a weird image on this gravestone marker.

900
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,800
 And they have a metal detector, and they detect metal in the grave.

901
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,800
 So they go to the people who run the cemetery and said, hey, we're from this UFO show.

902
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,800
 We think there's an alien in there. Can we dig up the grave?

903
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800
 And the cemetery people go, brains, brains, no.

904
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,800
 But the cemetery officials, the cemetery people, they're rotting underground.

905
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,800
 Cemetery officials say, no, you can't do that.

906
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,800
 And then apparently, or supposedly, whatever word we want to use here,

907
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
 when the MUFON crew went back to that site,

908
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,800
 the plaque, the gravestone marker with the UFO symbol was gone,

909
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,800
 but they knew the general location.

910
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,800
 They said that they broke out their metal detector

911
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
 and it picked up nothing.

912
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,800
 They said there ended up being like a little screw, like a little three inch pipe there,

913
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,800
 but it was picking up nothing.

914
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,800
 So the idea is that this alien was underground there.

915
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,800
 It was picking up the debris, and then when they went back, the body was moved.

916
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
 The plaque was moved, the body was moved.

917
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,800
 That could be, it could also be that they are now at the wrong grave.

918
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
 They basically just showed up at a different location in the graveyard,

919
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
 and they're like, oh no, where did it go? And the real grave's over there.

920
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
 I mean, I don't think they're that stupid, but you've got to look at all these different options.

921
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
 They did, and this was another thing, they did go test the well water.

922
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,800
 And the well water had high traces of aluminum.

923
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,800
 And when the ship crashed, they said, you know, we don't know what material this is.

924
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
 It looks kind of space-agey, but they figured it was some sort of aluminum alloy.

925
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,800
 So, you know, you have these weird, all of this stuff can be explained away legit.

926
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,800
 Like, you have old people basically arguing over what the truth is,

927
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,800
 but they're all 80 years old or more.

928
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
 So how much are they actually remembering?

929
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,800
 I'm 43, and I keep forgetting whether or not I've taken my medicine for the day.

930
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,800
 So when I'm 86, I don't know if I'll remember whether or not an alien crash landed in my town.

931
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
 So we have all that stuff.

932
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,800
 So did an alien really crash in Aurora?

933
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,800
 Are these airships actually a legit phenomenon?

934
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,800
 Was it something that people were actually seeing, or was it some sort of mass panic

935
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,800
 where people were looking up at the skies, they were concerned about the upcoming century?

936
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,800
 They were already hearing in the news about all these amazing technological advancements around the world

937
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,800
 and every cloud or misshaped object in the sky, that fat bird who was eating too many sardines,

938
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,800
 flying around, as you have all that stuff that's going on.

939
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,800
 Was it that, or was there a legitimate phenomenon of airships back in 1896, 1890?

940
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,800
 Why those two years as well? They kind of tapered off for quite a while.

941
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,800
 But if you picked the number four, you know the answer,

942
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
 because you were that alien that crash landed in Aurora, Texas.

943
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:55,800
 And you all chopped up, your bodies all mangled up, and then they bury you underground.

944
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,800
 And then they don't know that you have a healing factor.

945
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,800
 And then you wake up, pitch darkness, you're like, "What? This isn't my spaceship."

946
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,800
 And you start clawing at the wood.

947
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,800
 "What is this space-age material that have been surrounded in?"

948
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,800
 And then you realize it's wood and you're like, "Oh, maybe I can dig my way out."

949
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,800
 And it also sucks, because I'm an alien and I don't need oxygen to breathe.

950
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,800
 So I'm convening this box forever and you're like banging on the box.

951
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,800
 And then you also don't need food or water.

952
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:38,800
 So basically from 1897 to 2005, you're just underneath six feet of dirt.

953
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,800
 And you're just like, "Let me out, it's been over 100 years, this sucks."

954
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
 Actually, you don't even know how long it's been, because you don't have a watch.

955
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
 And maybe you have a good sense of internal time.

956
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,800
 But for over 100 years, you've just been clawing at wood.

957
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
 Also, you don't have fingernails.

958
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
 So it's basically like nubs just rubbing on wood.

959
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
 You can never get out. There's too much dirt.

960
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,800
 And then you hear a bunch of nerds above you shuffling around.

961
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,800
 They're like, "Well, maybe with the coordinates, this looks like some sort of UFO."

962
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,800
 Or, "Let's break out the metal detector."

963
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,800
 You're like, "Yes, yes, nerds, find me and release me from my dark grave."

964
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,800
 You're putting metal, you're like moving metal on top of you.

965
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
 "Detect this, hurry up, detect this."

966
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,800
 You're the metal detector detecting stuff.

967
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,800
 And then you hear some cemetery officials come out and they're like,

968
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,800
 "Get off of here, nerds, go away, go away. Shoot, shoot, shoot."

969
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
 They're chasing them off of the room.

970
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
 And you're like, "No, that was my only hope."

971
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,800
 And then a couple days later, like these FBI agents show up.

972
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
 And they're like, "This is going on way too long."

973
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
 And they dig you up, they dig you up.

974
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
 You're like, "Thank you."

975
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,800
 And you crawl out of the grave.

976
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,800
 And then you're like, "Thank you, law enforcement officers. I really appreciate it."

977
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:51,800
 And then the moon hits your alien skin.

978
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,800
 And you're immediately invigorated.

979
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,800
 "Yes, yes."

980
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
 And then you gut the FBI agents.

981
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
 And you pull their guts out.

982
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
 And they're like, "What do we ever do to you? We were your buddies.

983
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,800
 We were going to put you in a cloning facility and cut your organs out,

984
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
 but now we're not going to because you ripped our guts out.

985
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
 We're going home."

986
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
 And they leave and die.

987
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,800
 And then you run off into the woods.

988
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:20,800
 So if you pick number four, you are an alien hiding in the woods,

989
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,800
 looking for revenge against the humans who gave you proper burial.

990
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,800
 They thought you were dead, but you weren't.

991
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,800
 And they tormented you unknowingly in a dark grave.

992
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
 So if you pick number four now, you travel America.

993
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,800
 You're a backpacker who wears human flesh over your giant,

994
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,800
 giant gray alien head, but nobody notices it.

995
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,800
 You just have like human flesh and you accept rides from people.

996
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
 And then you murder them.

997
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
 And then that's it.

998
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,800
 That's just a serial killer alien is what you become.

999
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,800
 Which to be fair would be the best kind of serial killer there is.

1000
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
 Because think about it.

1001
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,800
 You want to leave fingerprints?

1002
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,800
 Anytime someone saw you doing something, they'd be like,

1003
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,800
 "Yeah, I saw this guy was like dating this chick for like three months.

1004
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
 And then she got like stabbed to death."

1005
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,800
 But he was also a three-foot-all alien.

1006
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
 The cops would be like, "What? That's insane."

1007
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,800
 So it would be the perfect alibi because you'd be an alien.

1008
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,800
 You just take your skin off every time like the dude was looking at you.

1009
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
 And then you put it back on for your girlfriend and turn it back around.

1010
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,800
 You could get away with so much amazing stuff.

1011
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,800
 I mean, not saying that being a serial killer is amazing.

1012
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
 But if you were a serial, if you had to be a serial killer,

1013
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
 you might as well be an alien serial killer.

1014
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,800
 And think about it. Let's say they do catch you.

1015
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,800
 And they arrest you. And you go to trial. You're found guilty.

1016
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,800
 They go to electrocute you in the electric chair.

1017
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,800
 Right as they're strapping you down, you pull out your little shrink ray.

1018
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,800
 And you shrink the electric chair, put it in your pocket.

1019
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
 And then you just stand there.

1020
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,800
 And they're like, "What happened to the electric chair?"

1021
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
 And you're like, "Oh, no. I don't know.

1022
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
 I was like this when I came in here. There was no electric chair."

1023
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,800
 So that is today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

1024
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
 Very, very well-planned episode, I'm sure you could tell.

1025
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
 But I really love doing this show.

1026
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
 And I hope you guys enjoy listening to it.

1027
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
 Actually, all of you guys aren't listening to it anymore,

1028
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,800
 because you picked a number and your fate has been sealed.

1029
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,800
 But to the people who didn't pick a number, I really, really appreciate it.

1030
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,800
 I hope you guys had fun. I have so much fun doing this show.

1031
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,800
 And I really hope you guys do have a great day.

1032
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,800
 When I intro this show like that, 100% authentic.

1033
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
 I want you guys to have a great day.
