1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 A young woman is the victim of a crime that makes her the perfect witness.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,920
 The problem is, the crime was murder.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,720
 And then we travel to 1989 Iraq to take a look at a story of a UFO crashing during the reign

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,300
 of Saddam Hussein.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,320
 Is there any truth to the story that Hussein immediately sent out special forces with two

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
 missions.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,040
 One, secure the UFO and two, hunt down any survivors today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:43,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,680
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,280
 We have a lot of stuff to cover so let's introduce our show supporter for today.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,280
 He donated during one of my live streams so we want to give you guys your shout outs to

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
 flying in on a homemade rocket ship.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
 It's on Jay.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
 Can't stop.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 Pieces are falling off.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 It's UG.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,200
 Everyone give a round of applause to UG.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,040
 He donated all of his money to support the show so he couldn't afford a rocket.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,560
 Hey Jason, I got a rocket.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
 Just like yours.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
 Of course you do UG.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
 Of course you do.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,840
 Get off that because I think it's about to blow up.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
 You guys can't support the show financially.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
 That's fine too.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
 Just help spread the word about the show.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,120
 It really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,800
 We pull UG out of the rocket ship after it crashed.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,480
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,600
 We are headed out to Yorkville, Canada.

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,120
 Jason Jalopy is driving through the highways and byways headed up to Yorkville.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,120
 It's November 2, 2002.

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,880
 And when we get to Yorkville, there's just an office building.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,400
 It's a single office building.

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
 It's an economically depressed town.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 But it's just an office building.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
 You know what I mean?

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
 It's nothing spectacular about it.

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
 But in this office building, Lisa Paws-Loone's works.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,680
 She's a 38 year old woman.

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,600
 She's a real estate agent.

45
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,280
 And she works on the 5th floor of the building.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,720
 And one night, it's time for her to go home and she's like going through paperwork and

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
 stuff like that.

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
 She's like, "Oh man, I probably should have picked a better job than a real estate agent.

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 I don't know what I'm doing.

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,920
 I'm just moving paper from one drawer to another.

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,760
 I've been doing it for years and no one's caught on yet."

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,840
 She's working late.

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
 She's moving paperwork around.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 Time to go.

55
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,520
 But a couple hours later, her sister notices that Lisa doesn't come home.

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 She's sitting there.

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
 She's like, "Oh man, Lisa's supposed to be here all the way."

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,560
 Which is the worst feeling, right?

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
 Because they have things going in the back of your head.

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,800
 You're thinking, "Oh, you know, they probably just are running late."

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,640
 But then you're always thinking, "What have they gotten a horrible car accident?

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,280
 What if something bad happened to them?"

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
 I hate that feeling.

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,800
 But we all suffer from it.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,920
 And 99.9% of the time, Lisa comes in.

66
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
 She's like, "Oh my God, you won't believe it.

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 I was walking on the street.

68
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,480
 This homemade rocket came out of nowhere, crashed in the middle of the avenue."

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,000
 Lisa's sister calls the cops and says, "Hey, she hasn't been home for a while."

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Again, let this be your render to you.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
 You do not have to wait 24 hours to report a missing person.

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
 You can report them right away.

73
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,880
 She calls the cops that night.

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,800
 Cops go to the place of business.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 They look around.

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
 They're walking around the office building.

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 They go up to her office.

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,400
 They're trying to figure out where she could be.

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
 Cops are walking through the building.

80
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,000
 They see a utility closet, red stain coming out of the closet.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,360
 The cops look at each other and they're like, "Your turn."

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,640
 They both say it at the same time, "Jinks!"

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,600
 They both owe each other cokes.

84
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,800
 But one of them does have to open the closet door.

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,560
 This is probably the end of the jokes.

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,320
 Because now we're confronted with the dead body of Lisa Poslans.

87
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,600
 The police's first suspect was a man named Rue Marquis.

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
 He was the janitorial superintendent.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 He was working there.

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,880
 He had keys for all the rooms.

91
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,400
 Had codes for all the rooms.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,080
 There was no other obvious suspects.

93
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
 He's there.

94
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 He has access.

95
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
 Does he have motive?

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 Who knows.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
 Like, did he have something against her?

98
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,120
 Did he want to murder someone that night or any night?

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 They don't know.

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
 They don't know any of this stuff.

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,800
 But of course they take him as a suspect.

102
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,840
 He does get cleared, but it's one of those like, "Don't go anywhere."

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
 Type of clearing things.

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
 He freezes in place.

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
 He's totally frozen.

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,600
 He's like, "Can I have some of the drink there?"

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 "No!"

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
 You have to stay there.

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,160
 For about four months he's cleared, but he's still on the suspicious list.

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
 He didn't quit his job.

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
 Which is weird.

112
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,760
 I would quit a job after a murder took place there.

113
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,260
 I'd be like, "I'm out."

114
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,000
 But maybe that would look super suspicious, but still.

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Or maybe he was...

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
 I don't know.

117
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 I wouldn't do that.

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,680
 Especially if they didn't know who murdered the person.

119
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
 I would not stay there.

120
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,120
 But he sticks around.

121
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,840
 And one night he's working in the office.

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,280
 And he's applying a shine to this black tabletop.

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
 And he sees a reflection in the tabletop.

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,680
 Now not his reflection.

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
 That wouldn't be shocking.

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
 He's like, "What?

127
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
 I heard about these things.

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 They're called mirrors."

129
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
 But I've never seen one in real life.

130
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,400
 He sees the reflection of someone else in the room.

131
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,880
 He looks up and standing next to the table is Lisa Postlums.

132
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,840
 He gasps.

133
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,200
 And all she does is point at the table and then disappear.

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,520
 Now after I changed my underwear, I would assume.

135
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,480
 I don't know what I would assume from that.

136
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
 I missed the spot?

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,080
 Like she's coming back from paradise to tell me I'm still not doing a good job.

138
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,560
 But what Rui thinks...

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,840
 First off, he thinks so much to learn how to pronounce my name.

140
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,200
 But then what Rui thinks is that...

141
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,760
 Wait a second.

142
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,600
 She's pointing at the black tabletop.

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 He's obviously been here.

144
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
 Her ghost is floating around here.

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,280
 And I've polished tabletops of all sorts of colors in this building.

146
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
 Why is she pointing at the black tabletop?

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,840
 That's when he remembers Nelson DeJesus, 36 year old employee, former employee who always

148
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,400
 wore black.

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,080
 Rui's like, "Hmm, it's interesting.

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,960
 He always wore black.

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,640
 Her ghost points at a black table.

152
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
 That's all I need."

153
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
 He actually said there was more stuff.

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
 He goes once, Nelson referred to Lisa as "hot."

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,480
 He told Rui, "Hey man, isn't she hot?"

156
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,080
 So he wears black clothing.

157
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,520
 A ghost points at something black.

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,160
 He says a woman's hot equals...

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,440
 He's a murder suspect now.

160
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,840
 But Rui's like, "Okay, all that makes sense.

161
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,280
 I've watched enough detective shows.

162
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,800
 I could totally be one of them."

163
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,800
 But on the other hand, I am kind of cleared, but I'm under suspicion of murdering this

164
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 woman.

165
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
 Should I go to the cops?

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 They'll probably think I'm crazy.

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
 He thinks about it for a while.

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
 And then he goes, "You know what?

169
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 Knocks on the door.

170
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
 He wakes up at 3 in the morning.

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
 How'd you find out where I lived?"

172
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 Never mind.

173
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,800
 I looked at you on my Facebook.

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
 He tells the cops at the police station, I assume.

175
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,200
 Not visiting their houses.

176
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
 I think I know who did it.

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,280
 This guy, Nelson, he always wore black and he said she was hot once.

178
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
 He might have murdered her.

179
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,800
 And he says, "That's not all the evidence I have.

180
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 I also have this.

181
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,640
 If you didn't believe that, her ghost showed up and pointed at a black table."

182
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,920
 And the cops are like, "Yeah, that's not really good evidence, but we don't have anything

183
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,240
 else to go off of."

184
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 They decide to check.

185
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,200
 This is ridiculous.

186
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 This is absolutely ridiculous.

187
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
 Not the ghost story.

188
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,080
 I actually believe that part of it.

189
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
 This next part's ridiculous.

190
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,960
 So Nelson used to work at the office building.

191
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,800
 And then he's not working there anymore.

192
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,360
 That doesn't automatically make you a suspect.

193
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,480
 Wearing black all the time doesn't automatically make you a suspect.

194
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,600
 Saying someone's hot doesn't automatically make you a suspect.

195
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,080
 Nelson, when they checked him out, he had a previous arrest, doesn't necessarily make

196
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
 you a suspect.

197
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,160
 He kidnapped and raped a 17 year old girl.

198
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,280
 That should make you a suspect.

199
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,080
 That should have been, they should have said who worked here, who used to work here, and

200
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,680
 then just start running priors.

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
 And to make it even worse, kidnapped and raped a 17 year old.

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
 He did two years in prison for that.

203
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
 Just two.

204
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 That's all.

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,440
 So anyways, they go and they talk to him and they get his DNA.

206
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
 And the DNA, you pretty much know where this is going.

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
 The DNA matched.

208
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,480
 And when the cops showed up, he like threw something out of his car or out of his.

209
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 He's just sitting in his bedroom.

210
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
 He throws it in his living room.

211
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,520
 The cops are like, "We'll just walk over here."

212
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,120
 But he tried to dispose of a rape kit.

213
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,280
 So it was like a, they generally have like rape kits and murder kits and thief kits.

214
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
 This is usually what you'll see.

215
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
 Thief kits, I have more familiarity with.

216
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,480
 It is a little bundle or package that will have like lock picking stuff in it, ceramic

217
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
 cubes for smashing windows.

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,600
 You can use an blood pressure cuff to pop open a window and get something, get a slim

219
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 gym in there.

220
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
 A slim gym is part of a thief kit.

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 What are those called?

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Dumb keys.

223
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,720
 The keys that are grounded down.

224
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 Bump keys.

225
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 Bump keys.

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 So you know what?

227
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,640
 And if you care, if you just have a bump key on you, that's super suspicious.

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,960
 But if you have a bump key and a lock pick set, some porcelain cubes, that's a thief

229
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
 kit.

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,400
 And they can charge you with that.

231
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,280
 It's called having burglary tools is what they can charge you with.

232
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,600
 I don't, I assume a rape kit would have none of that stuff and wouldn't might, but I'm

233
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
 assuming it has like duct tape and rope and stuff like that.

234
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 I don't know.

235
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 I don't know.

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,920
 But burglary kits, thief kits, you'll run into those.

237
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
 They're far more common.

238
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 Murder kits.

239
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
 Murder kits, basically just a knife.

240
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
 It's my kit.

241
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,520
 But yeah, you can charge them with having those tools.

242
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
 So they found him with that.

243
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
 His DNA matched.

244
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,280
 He was found guilty.

245
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,640
 Luckily, he got life with no parole for 25 years.

246
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
 So it's interesting.

247
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,440
 I read different articles on this, obviously, when I was researching it.

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,360
 One article is just the facts.

249
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,540
 In the Globe and Mail, which is a newspaper, it talks just about the conviction and the

250
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,800
 crime and everything like that.

251
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 The Clermont Sun.

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 It's another newspaper.

253
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,600
 They're the ones who actually go more into detail with the ghost thing.

254
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 And I'm surprised.

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,360
 One, I'm surprised this story's not more popular.

256
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,240
 Because there is a subgenre of true crime where ghosts solve the crime.

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
 There's not a lot of them.

258
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,520
 There's maybe like five or six.

259
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
 We've covered a couple on this show.

260
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,440
 I actually had a sneaking suspicion that I've already covered this one as well.

261
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,240
 So if I did, just ignore it.

262
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,840
 I tried checking, but yeah, it's one of those stories that it is possible that she came back

263
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,720
 from beyond the grave to help point out, literally point out her murderer.

264
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,600
 Now she's really lucky she didn't confront a Rui who was polishing a table of the color

265
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 of clothes he wore.

266
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,080
 Like, there's a lot of coincidences that had to play a part, but it turned out that Nelson

267
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,320
 was the murderer based on the DNA and priors and the kit and all that stuff.

268
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,280
 Very very bizarre story.

269
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,440
 It makes you wonder why more ghosts don't come back to solve crimes.

270
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,720
 But it could be because there's such an abstract set of circumstances.

271
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,840
 If someone else was working there that night, she pointed at the table and that person never

272
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
 knew Nelson.

273
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
 They'd be like, "What?

274
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 I missed the spot.

275
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
 Eee eee eee eee!"

276
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 There, ghosts are you fine?

277
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,340
 Might not even recognize the ghost.

278
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,400
 Might have just been super scared that a woman materialized in a room.

279
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,840
 But yeah, you wonder why there aren't more ghosts walking around neighborhoods, like

280
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
 just pointing in windows.

281
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
 Or maybe there are.

282
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,680
 Wouldn't that be creepy, I think?

283
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,120
 Like right now there's a ghost pointing at your neighbor's window.

284
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,600
 Like if you looked out right now you'd see a ghost pointing at your neighbor's window

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,240
 as he's sitting there eating Cheerios, watching the prices write.

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,960
 You're like, "Oh, the prices write is not awesome!"

287
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
 Totally ignore the ghost.

288
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960
 But then you realize your neighbor did some horrible deed and got away with it.

289
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,480
 Or did they?

290
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,080
 Technically they did, because they're still free, but UG, I'm gonna give you the keys

291
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,240
 to the Carbenter Coptor.

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,080
 We are leaving behind Yorkville, Canada.

293
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,360
 A murder was just solved with the help of a ghost.

294
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,080
 You know who else solves murders?

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
 Batman.

296
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,480
 You know what's funny, he doesn't really solve that many crimes, does he?

297
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,120
 He just beats people up.

298
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
 I mean, I guess like the crimes basically it's a bunch of guys in riddler costumes.

299
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,800
 Robin of Bank, he's like, "I wonder who's up to this.

300
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 It must be the Penguin."

301
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,760
 Like, does he ever go, "Man, there's a horrible crime scene."

302
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,920
 I read Batman comic books and every show often they'll have a one-off issue where it's

303
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,960
 some guys beating up a kid and the kid will be like, "Help me, Batman and Batman will

304
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
 help them."

305
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,320
 But then they'll have a four issue arc where it's like the Joker is making fish smile.

306
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,040
 And you think, anyways, anyways, in a world without Superman and an alien invasion is on

307
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,880
 its way.

308
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,720
 Is it possible that the Justice League can stop it this time?

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,400
 Find out March 18th when Zack Snyder's Justice League premieres on HBO Max, Ben Affleck,

310
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, and possibly Henry Cavill in any of the trailers

311
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,360
 Superman Still Alive, spoiler alert.

312
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
 Combine their might, their characters, not the actors, combine their might to take on

313
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,240
 Darkseid, Steppenwolf, and Granny Goodness.

314
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
 It's another villain in that franchise.

315
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,980
 So ridiculous.

316
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,160
 But watch Justice League, March 18th, only on HBO Max, rated R.

317
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,600
 Is it Granny Goodness or Granny Good?

318
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,320
 It doesn't matter, the promo's over.

319
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,520
 You're just looking at me like, "What are you talking about?"

320
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,720
 You barely are getting through these promos.

321
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
 This one was worse than yesterday's.

322
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,040
 UG flies on out to Iraq and guys, it's 1989, this is actually leading up to the first

323
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
 Gulf War.

324
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,080
 It's only a couple years away, so we gotta get prepared.

325
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
 Rock music's playing.

326
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 It's super loud.

327
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,920
 We can't hear instructions.

328
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
 People are falling out of the helicopter, we don't hear their cries for help, but it's

329
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 okay.

330
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,760
 You're still on board, UG's still piloting it, and I'm still playing the drums.

331
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,320
 This July 1989, we're actually headed to Kirkuk.

332
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,280
 That's in the Tayman province in Iraq.

333
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:24,040
 There's a bunch of people living in town and they look up one night.

334
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,440
 They see a fireball streaking across the sky.

335
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,160
 They watch it crash into a nearby mountain range.

336
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,680
 Everybody gets back to Baghdad in a fairly short time.

337
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,840
 That's something crashed in the countryside, so you're thinking, "Of course, this must

338
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
 be the Americans.

339
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,280
 They're really gonna crash and stuff.

340
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,160
 They love crashing stuff.

341
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,440
 Let's send out some vehicles.

342
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,480
 Maybe we'll scavenge some self-bomber parts."

343
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,440
 At the very least, it's a nice day trip.

344
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,600
 So now I'm wearing Bermuda shorts, he has a little Mai Tai.

345
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 Let's go, guys.

346
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,920
 He sends out the military and what they find is a wrecked vehicle.

347
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,720
 Basically looks like a giant bullet embedded in the mountain side.

348
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,040
 Steam and smoke still lifting out of the wreckage.

349
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
 I added that detail.

350
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,520
 It doesn't say that in the notes, but it's dynamic.

351
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,480
 It looks cool.

352
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 Basically was a bullet.

353
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,520
 It had a cylinder, it had a sharp tip.

354
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,240
 It was 39 feet long, 8 feet around.

355
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
 And as the soldiers are approaching it, they're looking at this.

356
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,880
 This doesn't look like any vehicle they've seen in any intelligence briefing.

357
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,160
 It definitely is nothing that they have.

358
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,920
 They see an opening in the back of the craft.

359
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,280
 The soldiers are creeping forward.

360
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,320
 They're seeing this huge opening in this craft.

361
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 They step inside.

362
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 Spooky, spooky, door opens up.

363
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,080
 There's a little girl in the corner ringing around the rosy.

364
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,560
 It's a spooky, it's probably not spooky, but it's spooky because it shouldn't be there.

365
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,720
 It's out of place.

366
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,760
 They see all sorts of electronic equipment lining the walls.

367
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:20,080
 Troops are moving through this vessel and they see sitting at the front of it a figure.

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,320
 It's not moving though.

369
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,240
 They walk up to it and they look.

370
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,360
 It's dead.

371
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,560
 The pilot is dead and the pilot is not human.

372
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,400
 What they see in the pilot's seat is what we would call a gray alien.

373
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,880
 It doesn't seem to have a gray skin tone.

374
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,960
 It seems to be more of a humanoid skin tone, but it has a large head, large eyeballs, four

375
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
 fingers.

376
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,400
 It's five feet tall and it's slumped in its seat, dead.

377
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,880
 So of course they got a call for backup.

378
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,000
 They got to figure out a way to move this vessel.

379
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,080
 Nobody wants to touch this body.

380
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
 It's super gross.

381
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,600
 But the commander on the scene is looking at this thing and he's looking at the opening

382
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,760
 in the back and he's kind of trying to figure stuff out.

383
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,660
 He comes up with a hypothesis.

384
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,800
 He tells his men, "I think what we're looking at is only part of the craft.

385
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,880
 I'll bet you anything, there's an escape pod that jettisoned off of it."

386
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,680
 And the Iraq commander is like, "We must find this escape pod.

387
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,200
 The droids cannot escape with those plans.

388
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,040
 The Rebel Alliance will pay for this."

389
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,160
 He starts ordering the men to find the escape pod.

390
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
 "Scour the mountains.

391
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,240
 Do whatever you need to do."

392
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 Just find that ship.

393
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,800
 They're like, "Oh, super scared of him all of a sudden?"

394
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,480
 He's cosplaying in the middle of the desert as Darth Vader.

395
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 That's dedication.

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 But they do.

397
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:59,760
 They start searching for this escape pod and a couple days later, they start moving, pushing

398
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,320
 brush aside and stuff like that.

399
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,280
 They're expecting to see Michael Jackson hiding in there.

400
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
 But no.

401
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,680
 They move aside brush and they see a grey alien crouch down.

402
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,040
 Obviously scared.

403
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,600
 You don't have to have a human face to look scared.

404
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,640
 Also stuff that's brave doesn't normally go "hee hee hee" he's making these high

405
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,120
 pitched squeaking sounds.

406
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
 Come with us, weirdo.

407
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,620
 They lead him away.

408
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,680
 They're really hoping to get Michael Jackson's autograph.

409
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,080
 They're super disappointed.

410
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,960
 By this time, Saddam Hussein has actually started the process of moving the crash UFO

411
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,080
 to a place that's east of Ibril.

412
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,480
 Now apparently in this region there are these natural caverns.

413
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,040
 And he figures this is actually a really good setup because we don't have to do much excavation.

414
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,680
 It's already here.

415
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
 You know what else?

416
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
 You know what else lived in caverns?

417
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,960
 Batman!

418
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,680
 But Saddam Hussein is not concerned about promos for Justice League.

419
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,640
 Zack Snyder's Justice League.

420
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,520
 They move this UFO into these underground caverns that they've now converted into a hanger because

421
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,800
 Saddam Hussein knows that this isn't US technology or Russian technology.

422
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,440
 He actually is very well aware of the existence of aliens.

423
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
 And he goes "the worst thing that can happen right now is these aliens show up to retrieve

424
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
 the craft.

425
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
 We need to hide it until we can study it."

426
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
 Because we have our backs against the wall.

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,920
 There's very few people in the world who like me.

428
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,000
 You little tear comes from his eye.

429
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
 They're like "It's okay, Saddam.

430
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
 The world will like you.

431
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,240
 Some days you mean it."

432
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,120
 So Iraq and Saddam Hussein never had a big alliance.

433
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,760
 Iran was constantly coming after him.

434
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
 Saudi Arabia was constantly coming after him.

435
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,880
 The United States was the one who eventually put the nail in their coffin.

436
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,920
 The aliens showing up would be worse than all those people put together.

437
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,280
 So he moves into this underground cavern and he figures "I can actually get some good

438
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
 stuff from this."

439
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
 Hopefully reverse engineer this thing.

440
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,240
 Like that would be ideal.

441
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,400
 So they take the body of the one alien and they put him in cryogenics.

442
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,480
 Because you know, maybe they can reverse engineer him or just turn him into some sort of biological

443
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
 weapon.

444
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,080
 The other alien they actually interrogate for two weeks.

445
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,760
 He didn't say anything other than "EEEEEE" I mean there was obviously a language barrier

446
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
 there.

447
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
 He's from another star system.

448
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,400
 He only says "EEE" and he's being interrogated in Iraq in 1989.

449
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,280
 So I don't think they're just like "Tell us more.

450
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
 Tell us more."

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,360
 I'm sure that he was being tortured.

452
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,120
 Did you imagine traveling across the cosmos to crash land in Iraq in 1989?

453
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,960
 I mean that would just be the worst.

454
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
 That would be so bad.

455
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,200
 I'm sure they tortured him.

456
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,680
 They couldn't get any info from him.

457
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,880
 He died in captivity.

458
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,240
 But they did learn things apparently from dealing with these greys.

459
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,040
 I thought this was a really interesting thing.

460
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,920
 The theory that these Iraqi scientists came away from is that they're not alive.

461
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,280
 They're alive but they're what were called biorobots.

462
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,760
 So that might be a translation thing of like a clone.

463
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,200
 But basically the Iraqi scientists said they're disposable.

464
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,240
 Nobody's coming after these guys.

465
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,940
 If they crash land it is, you know how in the marines no man left behind?

466
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,240
 Their rule is all men left behind.

467
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,120
 If you crash you get shot down they will never come after you to retrieve your vessel.

468
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,800
 It's really interesting because when we think about all the UFO stories we've heard about

469
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,200
 crash landings, off the top of my head, I may be wrong we may have covered one or two but

470
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,360
 off the top of my head normally these vehicles just crash and the people are there.

471
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,920
 And the bodies are recovered or they're not or they're chased down or anything like that.

472
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,000
 You very rarely again off the top of my head, I'm recording this at like 11 o'clock at night

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,120
 but a UFO crashing and then another UFO coming up to save those original crew members.

474
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,360
 I could be wrong it's not common.

475
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,640
 So that would make sense if you had, and it would make sense too like when we were sending

476
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,840
 explorers from the old world, from Europe to the new world, they weren't like oh no

477
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
 king we lost a ship.

478
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,360
 He's like send all the ships to save that one.

479
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,240
 No he was just like ship's lost dude.

480
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 All your gold is flowing around, it's not flowing around it's like the bottom of the

481
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
 ocean.

482
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,840
 The king's like yeah I'll just send more gold over.

483
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,600
 Saddam and his top generals would actually tour this facility east of Ibril and they

484
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,320
 had seen the alien corpses themselves and seen the UFO themselves.

485
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,040
 A year after this UFO supposedly crashed in Iraq they invaded Kuwait.

486
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,320
 Which was a real ballsy move and I remember he was going in, I remember working for Saddam

487
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 and St. Council.

488
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 Now I remember watching the news back then I was a teenager but it was a real ballsy move

489
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,000
 it was just trying to see, it was the same thing like when Russia invaded Georgia.

490
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,440
 Let's see what other people will do.

491
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
 Russia got away with it, Iraq didn't.

492
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 They got attacked by Esther in the first cold war.

493
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
 But this idea and this theory that whatever he found on this vessel emboldened him, he

494
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,480
 thought that it would allow him to do what he wanted to do and it didn't.

495
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,600
 He went into Kuwait, he got kicked out.

496
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,720
 But that first war when America pushed the forces back into Iraq there was a big debate

497
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
 over whether or not we should just conquer Iraq or just push all the way in and take

498
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,640
 back down in the top of Saddam Hussein and all that stuff.

499
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,600
 And I remember watching that debate on television and I'm sitting in Saddam Hussein's palace

500
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,800
 and I'm like hey guys I might have to go back to the United States it's kind of spooky.

501
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,200
 But we chose not to and then of course we went back in in 2003.

502
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,440
 But this story continues then.

503
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:45,320
 In 2003 when US forces fully invaded Iraq, fully went into Iraq, supposedly a special

504
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:51,360
 forces unit was specifically sent to the Hebrew facility.

505
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,760
 But when they got there the entire complex had been destroyed.

506
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,240
 There were explosives all in the underground cave system.

507
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
 They were all blowing up.

508
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,280
 Saddam Hussein's logic, if I can't have it, nobody can.

509
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,960
 And what's interesting is that was his logic when he was leaving Kuwait when he set all

510
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
 the oil fields on fire.

511
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,680
 Cause that huge ecological disaster, if I can't have it, nobody can.

512
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,040
 And it actually matches up to something that Saddam Hussein would do.

513
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,320
 That story is actually told by two Ukrainian UFOologists Anton Anfalov and Lenura Azizov.

514
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,640
 And you go that's weird.

515
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,240
 Why are Ukrainian UFOologists talking about a UFO that may have crashed in Iraq?

516
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,520
 UG, take us up in that carbonicopter one last time, we're leaving behind Iraq, we're headed

517
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,920
 to Kiev in the Ukraine.

518
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 Summer of 1947 they're actually doing reconstruction after World War 2.

519
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,120
 The Kiev Conservatory had been completely destroyed.

520
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,000
 And as they're moving aside rubble and having to dig a new foundation and fix all of this

521
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,680
 stuff.

522
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,280
 Deep underground they find a bullet shaped craft.

523
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,760
 It had two seats in it and the back end appeared to be missing.

524
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:21,400
 This one, based on estimates of soil and sediment around it, based on scientific stuff around

525
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,540
 this vessel, it is believed to be 3000 to 5000 years old.

526
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,920
 People say that there were glyphs on the vessel itself that appeared to be in Sanskrit.

527
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:42,840
 And 10 years after this vehicle was found, just 10 years later, the war torn Soviet Union

528
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,280
 launches the very first satellite humans have ever sent off into space.

529
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,280
 Were they able to reverse engineer this craft the same way that Saddam Hussein wanted to

530
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,520
 reverse engineer it?

531
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,180
 After all there was a UFO crash in Iraq.

532
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,220
 We don't know, that story is told by two Ukrainian UFOologists and they are connected

533
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,980
 to the other story in Kiev about the bullet shaped UFO.

534
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,180
 But if the stories are true, we're looking at two vessels found 40 years apart.

535
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,620
 One that crashed 3000 years ago and one that crashed in 1989.

536
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,200
 They had the same shape, the same design.

537
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,600
 They both were two-seaters, they both had escape pods.

538
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,820
 But besides that, what if, let's put on our conspiracy caps to wrap this up here.

539
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,000
 Is it possible that you could have a survivor of an alien craft back when people were looking

540
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,720
 up at the sky and seeing these burning craft coming down and thought it was witchcraft

541
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,640
 or thought it was the gods or thought it was fate, but really it was a high tech vehicle

542
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,160
 out of control.

543
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,240
 The escape pod disengages and at least one of them gets away.

544
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,840
 The other one?

545
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,680
 Replaceable.

546
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
 Just the biorobot.

547
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:10,000
 So in the Ukraine, was there a grey alien walking around in the 1500s?

548
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,360
 Trying to survive, doing whatever it could to stay alive.

549
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:25,280
 Even though it knew it was disposable, it still had a drive to exist.

550
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,640
 But not only exist, it still had a mission to study humans.

551
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,600
 So although it wanted to disappear into the wilderness, it still stuck close.

552
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,480
 Watched people walk through the forest on their way home.

553
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,880
 The grey alien stood in the darkness and peered through the window as families read by candlelight.

554
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,000
 It watched villages become towns and towns become cities.

555
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,760
 And the whole time it was steady in us.

556
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,880
 When people were fearing werewolves and vampires and evil eyes and witches, they should have

557
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,280
 been fearing the greys.

558
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,520
 Standing outside of their homes.

559
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,320
 Because despite the fact that it was billions of miles from its home planet and it knew

560
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,440
 rescue would never come, it had a mission.

561
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,880
 Was that mission just to survey us?

562
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,480
 Or was that mission to begin interbreeding with us?

563
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,920
 To begin medical experiments on us?

564
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,520
 To begin testing our bodies for weaknesses?

565
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,560
 Who knows?

566
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,240
 It's one thing to be taken to Count Dracula's castle.

567
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,480
 It's another thing to be dragged off into the woods.

568
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
 Taken to a cave.

569
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,080
 Throwing down on a hard slab.

570
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,480
 As this crash survivor injects you.

571
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,400
 With a toxin it brewed from local herbs.

572
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,560
 The blades are a little duller.

573
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 The pain will be a little more intense.

574
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:08,200
 And as you feel that iron blade press against your abdomen, you will wish you were on board

575
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,080
 a high tech starship.

576
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,960
 Take the supervision of several scientists as a laser scalpel cuts your skin.

577
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,280
 Instead you fill the dull, cold cut of a handmade tool.

578
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,200
 The alien may not have everything it needs to perform a successful operation, but it

579
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,520
 will get the results done.

580
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,880
 And even if no one is ever able to read the results of his experiment, he has a mission

581
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:59,600
 to do.

582
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:16,000
 Thank you.

583
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,580
 (upbeat music)

584
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:28,580
