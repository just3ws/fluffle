1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A possible message from the future is recorded live on a local radio station.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 A woman in the middle of a drug-fueled delusion makes a horrible decision.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Then we take a look at a bizarre story of a man who claims he was abducted by aliens while in his bedroom.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But deeper questions are raised during his story, because as he's trying to outrun his alien adversaries,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 he has an encounter with something even more frightening.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And it may answer the question, what happens to us after we die today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvin, or I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're going to slide right into this first stop.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Dimont.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Dimont, thank you so much for supporting the show.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 It really, really helps out a lot.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 It really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm taking a hot, so hot in here.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's so hot.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Hopefully it's a nice, cool weekend and you guys are less hot than I am right now.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 First off, Dimont, let's go ahead and take that Dead Rabbit Durgible.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We're leaving behind America.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're headed down to Australia.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 This first segment is kind of short, but we've talked about earlier in this week even about weird radio transmissions.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And this one recently popped up, so we're bringing that Durgible down to Australia.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 They were going to meet a young woman named Snackquarious.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 That's not a real name.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I don't think that's her real name.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's her TikTok handle, at least.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So we're saying hi to Snackquarious.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 She's waving to us and then she's like shh, shh, shh.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 She's shushing us.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And we all crowd into her car because on August 27th, 2020, so just a couple of days ago, really,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 as she was driving down the sunny, sunny street of Australia, there's just one street for the whole continent,

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 she intercepts a transmission on her radio station.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now, before I play it, I'm going to let you know there is some cursing in this.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 So if you're listening to this at work or if your grandma is walking by as you're listening to this,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 just be aware of that.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But there is some cursing in this clip.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I hope it does it again.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 [Song playing]

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So she recorded it from what I can tell from, and I talked to her to get permission to play the clip

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and she was very nice.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 She allowed me to do that.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 But if we listen, so thank you for that.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 If you listen to it, the context sounds like it's played through at least once already.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 She was trying to see if the signal came back through.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 It was on channel 102.5 in the city that she's in.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 This video went viral on TikTok.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 She did a follow-up one.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And one thing that makes me think that there's a couple of reasons why I think it's not a gimmick or fraud is that

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 she did two videos on this and then she kind of went back.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 She normally does like comedy skits and things like that.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So she did the two videos on it and then she just kind of went back to doing her thing.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So it's not like she was making it up and she was keeping this myth going.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I'd like to know more about it, but it didn't seem like it was something like, what was that, 2028 man?

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Where it was like, that was his whole thing was coming up with this gimmick.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 She had a ton of videos before this.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 They're just comedy skits.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And then this one that she kind of intercepted this bizarre transmission.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 There's a lot of people on TikTok who were trying to interpret it what it was saying.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And this was one of the versions that we got.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Let me play it for you one more time here.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I hope it does it again.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 [Side-by-side conversation]

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And so one of the things that people said that that transmission may have been saying was,

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 for anyone listening to this message and is in contact with the time council,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 tell them he has escaped and, and then it kind of gets jumbled there,

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and then it ends with the phrase, I don't have much time.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Someone else pointed out that it seems to have said, don't say anything more about the tragedies.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 1065 or 2065 is a disagreement on that.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Please hurry, I don't have much time.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So some, there's a lot of different kind of things you can pick out of it,

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 but definitely the time council thing pops up.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Now, Snack Quarrius said this is a classical music station,

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and the station had actually contacted her and they were trying to figure out what it was.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 While other people on TikTok were saying that they, for whatever reason, this is a weird jumble logic,

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 but they thought it was an escape room in the area.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 There, you know, escape rooms are those things where you get all your friends,

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 you go in a room for an hour, and then you hate everyone's guts because you realize you can't work as a team.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 That's basically you pay $100 for the privilege of ruining friendships.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Some people said that that could have interfered with this transmission.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I'm not buying that.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I don't know Australian law, but in American law, it is incredibly illegal to interfere with a broadcast.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It costs a lot of money.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Like you have licensing fees, you buy that frequency as a radio station, or you lease it from the government.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And when other people are interfering with that frequency, it's a massive federal crime.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And I would imagine that would be the same thing in Australia.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Otherwise people would just constantly be interfering with radio stations and be like,

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 "I have to buy ad time. I'm just going to build this transmitter broadcast in the middle of Mozart,

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 being like, "Come on down, I'll lose cars."

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't buy that explanation.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 If a local themed escape room was able to broadcast over a radio station,

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 they'd be in really big trouble for that, at least in America.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And again, I'm assuming the same thing, sure, in Australia.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So I don't think she's making it up, and I don't buy the escape room thing.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So that's that story. I mean, it's fairly short. We just don't have enough information to go on.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But it'll be interesting to see what comes out of this.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 If Snack Quarius was the only one who heard this transmission, I don't think she's faking it.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So if Snack Quarius was the only one who heard this transmission, it would make it seem more suspicious

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 that it actually is a signal from the future.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And for whatever reason, her car was on the right space, and the space time continuum,

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 she was literally on Space Street and Time Boulevard when this signal was playing.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 If it was played to everyone who was listening to 102.5 at the time,

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 that would be even weirder, because then you'd wonder why other people weren't reporting this, or are they?

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 There's just a lot of questions to answer here.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I think it's interesting, though, because a lot of times that we hear about Mysterious Broadcasts,

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 we talked about the number stations before, this is one that just happened the other day.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 We don't know what they're saying. We don't know what they want. Who knows?

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I mean, again, it's a mystery. Who was broadcasting this? Why were they broadcasting it?

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Is it true? Does the Time Council need help?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I mean, actually, now that you think about it, you figure that the Time Council might have better microphones

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 so they can actually leave messages.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But if there's some sort of warping in that Space Time bubble that apparently exists in Australia,

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 then that could also account for the audio difficulties.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 That's going to be my excuse now. People will be like, "You mispronounced that word?"

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 They'll be like, "Hey, Time Space, bro. Time Space. Let's wave goodbye to Snackquarious.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 We wave goodbye to her. We see the Time Council grabbing her.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Or like, "Should we help her?" Nah, she can take care of herself.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 She's like, "No, I can't. I can't." She's trying to entertain him with comedy skits.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We, I'm sure she will do a good job keeping them distracted.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We are going to leave behind Australia.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Daimon, let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 We're going to row all the way back to America.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Everyone grab an ore where it's going to be a long time rowing.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 We're headed out to Anderson, South Carolina. It's February 6th, 2017.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 We get there. We're walking around Anderson and there's like a railroad track.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 [singing]

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Apparently Santa Claus. Apparently it's the Polar Express.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 [singing]

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 That was the noise I was trying to make. This is an old timey.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Even though this is the place in 2017, there's a ghost train coming through.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Two good s'please.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Kylie Murthart. She's a 21-year-old girl.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 She's walking down the railroad tracks.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Now, also nearby the railroad tracks is a homeless shelter.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 So if you ever wonder in which side is the wrong side of the tracks,

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 it's the side with the homeless shelter.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And all these homeless people are kind of hanging outside

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 and they see Kylie Murthart walking down the railroad track.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I don't really think anything of it, right?

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 But she's thinking of something.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 She had just smoked a bunch of meth.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 She'd actually been smoking meth quite compulsively for a while.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 She's walking down the railroad track and she starts to go into full-blown meth psychosis.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 We get a real idea of what meth can do to the mind with this story.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 She's walking down the railroad tracks and she sees the light poles on the side of the street,

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 the street lights.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 She's looking at one of them.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And then the light pole morphs into a dove.

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 She's like, "Oh no, I'm in the dark!"

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 She doesn't actually... She has bigger problems, really.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 She just watched inanimate matter turn into a living creature.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 I don't think she's scared of the dark at this point.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 She notices the trees lining the streets are kind of swaying in the breeze

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and then they begin to curl downwards.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Almost like when you light one of those little snakes on 4th of July.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Not real snakes.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 What are those things called?

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They're called snakes, but those little firecracker things that you light and they shrivel up.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 That.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 You're like, "Jax, I don't know."

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You could have just said the trees curled downwards.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Now I'm trying to remember what you're talking about.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 You know, like the sizzle snakes.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Anyways, it's like a tree curled downwards.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Imagine if it melted.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 There we go.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 She's watching that.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 The sky begins to turn dark.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Not because the sun is setting.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 This is apocalyptic dark.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 She believed that she was watching the end of the world.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And she's walking and she stops and she realizes that she has been given a mission.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Only she can save the world from ending.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Now the main chapel and mercy center.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 That's the homeless shelter.

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 You got a bunch of people, the reverends out there.

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Be like, "Hey guys, come inside.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's really cool inside."

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And they're like, "Ah, we're fine.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 It's just this.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 We kind of like being outside."

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Revere's like, "Yeah, it's kind of nice out here."

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 "Wait, where'd that streetlight go?"

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And everyone's like, "Huh?"

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 They see this young girl walking by the railroad tracks.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And then they watch her fall to her knees and begin screaming.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So the Reverend and the homeless people, which is an awesome name for a band, by the way.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 The Reverend and the homeless people, they start running towards her.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 They see her and she's screaming in pain.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And as they get closer to her, they realize her fingers are in her eye sockets.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And she pulls both of her eyeballs out.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 She's holding them in her hands and the Reverend and the homeless people are trying to get them out of her hands in the most gentle way possible.

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 You can save an eyeball as long as it's attached.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And even then, I think they can probably work some sort of magic.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Not literal magic, scientific magic, but she's pulled both of her eyeballs out.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 She believes that the only way to stop the end of the world is to do this.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And as the Reverend and all those hobos are trying to wrestle her and get her grip off those eyeballs in the most gentle way possible,

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 she squeezes both of her hands, destroying both eyes.

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Now fast forward to the year 2020.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 She has no eyes.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 There's no way to repair them once you squeeze them.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 But the reason why I came up in the news recently is because she has artificial eyes now.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Now it's not like Jordy LeFord, she doesn't have like sci-fi vision.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 They're just not empty sockets anymore.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So because she got her artificial eyes, the media wanted to follow up.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I don't remember this story happening at the time, but I'm sure it was a kind of a shocking news story.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 She actually says, listen, I shouldn't have done that obviously.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Like I was in the middle of meth and do psychosis.

211
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I didn't need to destroy my eyeballs.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But I'm doing okay.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I'm doing okay.

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm learning braille.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I'm pretty good at braille now.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They actually had video of her like strumming along on a guitar.

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 She goes, my boyfriend has been really helpful in this journey.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And she goes, I want to help people not do meth.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 If my story keeps people from doing meth, which really I think any meth story would keep someone from doing meth.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But this one in particular, obviously, she's like, I ruined.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I ruined my eyeballs.

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 She doesn't say she ruined her life because she's actually doing quite good now.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 She's clean and she's making the best to go.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Being blind is not a depth sentence.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I've had friends who have been blind, but I mean, it's not super fun, but it's also not the end of the world.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So she goes, you know, hopefully people learn from my story.

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 She had no trouble because she had no problem doing stuff in the media.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 She goes, I got these new eyeballs in.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So now I don't have these just empty sockets.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Everything seems to be going pretty good.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So as horrible as this story is, it's always nice to see the person and not just surviving, but thriving.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So that's the story of Kaylee.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And yet another reason why you shouldn't do meth.

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I think we've covered quite a few on this show.

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 But the idea of pulling your own eyeballs out to me is one of the most terrifying things.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 If someone else pulled my eyeballs out, I'd be like, is that all you got?

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And they're like, yes, I have this whole toolkit of torture weapons.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I'm like, I can't see them.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So whatever, bro.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But me pulling my own eyeballs out, that is scary to me.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Right? I don't know why.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I don't know why that's more scary to me.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I would hate to pull my own eyeballs out.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 If someone's like, we're going to shoot you.

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Don't pull your eyeballs out.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I'm like, you didn't say please.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's this weird thing.

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 If someone makes me do it or if someone else takes them out.

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I'm like, yeah, whatever.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I'll get some fake ones and be in Newsweek a couple years from now.

251
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 But I don't know.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 It's just such this weird thing.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Anyways, don't do meth.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Hope that didn't ruin your meatball stew.

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 What do you have meatballs and spaghetti and meatballs?

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I hope they didn't ruin your--

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Why did I say stew is the first thing with a meatball in it?

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Hope they didn't ruin your spaghetti and meatball.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 You have a bread bowl in the shape of a human skull

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and you have like spaghetti and meatballs.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 You're like, oh, I'm so hungry.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I can't wait to eat this.

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I'm going to listen to that rave rady on Friday.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Sorry if I ruined that meal that I just made up.

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Daimon, let's go ahead and fire up that carboner copter.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 We got one more story to cover this episode.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So let's say goodbye to Kylie.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Let's say goodbye to the Reverend and the homeless people.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 They're starting up their jam band and just hanging on garbage cans,

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 playing homemade guitars.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 It sounds pretty good, actually.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Well, we buy one of their CDs.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 They did start a jam band where we'll listen to it for the rest of our journey.

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 We are headed out to Rochester, New York.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 It's December 3, 1999.

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 The helicopter is flying through the darkened sky surrounding New York City.

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's 2.15 a.m.

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I got this story from thinkaboutadox.com

279
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and it was reported to them from the National UFO Reporting Center.

280
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 So we don't have the name of the man in this story,

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 but we will call him Nick.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So as the carboner copter is flying around Rochester, New York,

283
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Nick is getting ready for bed.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He goes, man, I really like to fall asleep.

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But there's a helicopter flying really low

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 and they're playing music that I can only imagine homeless people would make.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And there's like some guys singing Christian hymns

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and then I just hear the sounds of garbage cans getting turned over.

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 We're playing it super loud.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Nick, though, finally buys some earplugs and he goes,

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 "Time to go to bed."

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Now, there are other people in the house.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He's like, "Good night, guys."

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 They're like, "Good night."

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So he's not alone in his house,

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 but he does go into his bedroom, gets ready for bed.

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 After Nick goes into his bedroom,

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 the rest of his buddies are kind of hanging out.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They're digging to the homeless man music.

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 They're like, "Oh, dude, this is really awesome."

301
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "Turn it up."

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 They yell into the night sky and we oblige them.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Other than that, other than that part of the story I made up,

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 they hear from Nick's room a very loud commotion.

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They hear a bunch of noise coming from there.

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 They don't check on them, okay?

307
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They don't check on them.

308
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 They don't do anything.

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They just kind of sit there and hear a bunch of noise.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That's roommates for you, right?

311
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 That's roommates for you.

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 "Hey, man, what were you doing last night?"

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 "It sounded like a bunch of dudes broken into your bedroom

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 and like held you up at gunpoint."

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 "That's what happened, dude!"

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 "Why didn't you do something about it?"

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 "I was playing GoldenEye, man."

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That's roommates for you.

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So from Nick's point of view, he walks into his bedroom

320
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and something kind of clicks in his head.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 He's looking around the room and it's his bedroom.

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But he can't shake the feeling that it just looks like his bedroom.

323
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 That's not really his bedroom.

324
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He says it looked like a hospital room

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 disguised as his bedroom.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And then his sister walks in the room.

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 "Hey, Nick, how you doing, man?"

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "Why don't you lay down in the bed?"

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He's like, "What? That's kind of weird."

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 "First off, what are you doing here?"

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 "I don't think the sister lived with him."

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 "But what are you doing here?"

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 She's like, "Oh, nothing. You know, just doing that normal thing

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 where I show up at 2.15 a.m. until you go to bed."

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Like, I've always done, right?

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 He's like, "No, you've never done that before.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 This is super weird."

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He's talking to her and he realizes this isn't my sister.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 "Looks like my sister."

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 "That's not my sister."

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And as he's kind of processing this information,

342
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 he's in a room that looks like his bedroom.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 That's not his bedroom.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 He's talking to his sister, but he knows it's not his sister.

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 His mom walks in.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 He says, "Nic, you need to lay in that bed."

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 "Lay in the bed, dude."

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 He is like, "Okay, that's not my real mom either."

349
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Like, now definitely something's up, right?

350
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 A hospital room disguises your bedroom.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Fake sister shows up.

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But when a fake mom shows up, that's a bridge too far.

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But what's he going to do?

354
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 He's pretty much trapped at this point

355
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 in a place that he should be his most comfortable in his bedroom.

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 He looks at his bed and what he sees is a metallic hospital bed.

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And it had wires coming out of it.

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 He walks over to the bed and he puts his hand down on the bed

359
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 and shocks him.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 So now he knows, listen, there's too much weird stuff going on right now,

361
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 but there's no way I'm getting in this bed.

362
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I don't care what my fake mom and my fake sister says.

363
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He runs out of the room.

364
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 His bedroom now opens to a long barren hallway

365
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 and he just begins to run down the hallway.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And at that point, a man in a tight-fitting blue jumpsuit begins pursuing him.

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Now, it can easily be chalked up to some sort of weird dream,

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 but the fact that the other people in the house heard the noises,

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 heard commotion in his room,

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 makes me think this is more than just a dream,

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 makes me think that this did start off as some sort of physical alien abduction.

372
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 In the moment he knows, in the moment when he's running down that hallway,

373
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 he knows he's nowhere near his house.

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 He's somewhere, but he's not near his house.

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 He ends up breaking through the doors.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He's not the Kool-Aid man.

377
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 He just opens them, right?

378
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But just for dramatic purposes, he puts his shoulder to it,

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 plywood shatters across the street.

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 He's running down the street now.

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He's gotten out of this building that he was transported to.

382
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And then he sees a very creepy addition to this story.

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 He sees his grandma outside the building.

384
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 His grandma had passed away a couple of years ago.

385
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Even if she hadn't, it'd still just be weird, right?

386
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Because she's in this area where he's been abducted.

387
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But the grandma isn't a fake grandma.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 What are you doing, Nick?

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Go back in and lay on the bed.

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 She's not a fake grandma.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That's his real grandma.

392
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Because as the man in the blue jumpsuit is gaining ground on Nick,

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Nick hears his grandma beg,

394
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "Please take me. Take me instead. Take me instead."

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Nick's just running down the street.

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 This guy in this blue suit just keeps running.

397
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Doesn't even listen to the grandma.

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Nick turns and looks, and he sees another man in a blue suit running,

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 pursuing a woman trying to get away.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And as he's watching that, he sees the man grab ahold of the woman

401
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 and begin dragging her back into the facility.

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He realizes at this point,

403
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 "Okay, I know about fight or flight. I'm trying to do the flight.

404
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's not really working. This guy's catching up to me."

405
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 He turns around and he gets ready to fight this guy head on.

406
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And when he turns around, he notices the guy in the blue suit

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 is wearing a visor,

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 covering up most of his face,

409
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 except for a creepy grin.

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Spread across his face.

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I guess that makes it less creepy when I do my cartoon dog laugh.

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He sees a creepy grin on the dude's face.

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 He figures, "You know, I could probably take this dude.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He's maybe 180 pounds, six feet tall, whatever.

415
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I could do some jiu-jitsu moves, whatever."

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 The dude in the blue suit with the creepy grin grabs Nick's genitals

417
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 and lifts him off the ground, as easily as a man

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 picking up a jug of milk out of a fridge.

419
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 He's like, "Whoa, whoa!"

420
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 There's a lot of ways you can lose a fight,

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 but being lifted off the ground by your genitals

422
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 might be the most embarrassing one.

423
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And this dude begins carrying him down the street by his junk.

424
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Which at that point, you just kind of give up, right?

425
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I mean, you might be able to knee the guy in the face,

426
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 but you just got to give up at that point, right?

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Because what are you going to do?

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He's going to squeeze him until you lose.

429
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Nick is throwing in the back of an oar.

430
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 This whole story is weird.

431
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And what I love about it is it progressively gets weirder.

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 We already had the grandma plea to take her grandson's place.

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Which makes me think, is this where ghosts go?

434
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Is this a version of hell, or is he being pursued by demons?

435
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Does everyone go to heaven or hell, except for grandmas,

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 they get to hang out outside UFO abduction facilities?

437
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Her addition to the story is just creepy.

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And her begging to be taken into this specific...

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She's like, "Oh, these are the aliens who grab people by the crotch, eh?

440
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Maybe I'll give me some of that action."

441
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Sorry, Nick's grandma. Sorry for that.

442
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But, you know what I mean?

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You have this idea of people dying and their ghosts

444
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 not just kind of floating around some haunted castle,

445
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 but floating around outside an alien abduction facility,

446
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 trying to save their loved ones. That's kind of spooky.

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It's very spooky actually, right?

448
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Then we have people being picked up by their genitals and carried around.

449
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Again, bizarre detail number three.

450
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You know those vans that you're supposed to stay away from?

451
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 That everyone, unless you're a construction worker,

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 should not go anywhere near one of those white vans?

453
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Apparently, if they're orange, those creeper vans are actually UFOs.

454
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So Nick is thrown in the back of an orange creeper van.

455
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And he's like, "Ahh, dang it, I really want that crotch thing!

456
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Guys, I might run away again! You guys want to catch me?"

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And they're like, "Ugh."

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 He's thrown in the back of this creeper van,

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and they shut the doors and stuff like that.

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And he turns around, and in the back seat of the creeper van,

461
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 there's three kids. But not just three kids,

462
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 because that's just a creepy addition to the story.

463
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They're telepaths.

464
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 He's in the back of the van, there's three telepath kids in there,

465
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 and the van begins to fly away.

466
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 He's flying away into the night sky.

468
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 He begins trying to resist them.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 He starts trying to fight his--

470
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I don't know why he waited until they were 30,000 feet in the air.

471
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 He's like, "Now it's time to make my escape!"

472
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He opens the door and jumps out.

473
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 He starts fighting back.

474
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He gets electrocuted in the back of the head.

475
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's a very common thing with alien abductions.

476
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I've lost count of the amount of stories where people are messing around with aliens.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And the next thing they know, they get a shock stick to the base of the skull.

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So again, that's another detail.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I mean, obviously it can be fake.

480
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 The guy could be a big old UFO fan.

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 He has a little pen that says UFO on it.

482
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I don't know.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That is a very common thing.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 He gets shocked in the back of the head.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 The next thing he knows, he's laying in a room.

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Probably the room he started off in, really.

487
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 All of this could have been avoided had he just laid--

488
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I'm not advising you to lay down in the bed if you're fake relative shows him and tells you to,

489
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 but he did burn a lot of calories and got picked up by his crotch and all sorts of stuff.

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 He wakes up in a room and he said it was filled with a reddish-orange light.

491
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 He could barely see anything in this room.

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And he's laying on this metal bed.

493
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And then what he describes as a non-human creature crawls on top of him.

494
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 [makes noises]

495
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Little hands on his body.

496
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The creature straddles him.

497
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And the creature begins--

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 [makes noises]

499
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Purring.

500
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 You like that noise? This ASMR alien abduction story?

501
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 [makes noises]

502
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The alien starts purring as it's moving back and forth on his body.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 He starts to fight back, right?

504
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Because this is gross. This is super gross.

505
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 You don't want anything non-human purring on--

506
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 [laughs]

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I guess I'm not a cat. I think cats are fine.

508
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But this thing is obviously doing something super gross to him.

509
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So he starts fighting back and the creature tries to hold his arms down,

510
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 but he's like, "No way, dude."

511
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And he ends up touching this creature's face and he said it felt--

512
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I love this--

513
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 inhuman, right?

514
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 The fact that it was some sort of alien monster didn't clue him onto the fact

515
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 that when he touched its face, he described it as in--

516
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 of course!

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Dude, the other day I saw Rhino, dude.

518
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And then he like ran at me.

519
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And then I like touched his face. You won't believe it, dude.

520
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 It wasn't human.

521
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 It didn't have--

522
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Yeah, of course, dude! Also, how did you survive that?

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 The point is that if you saw a monster, you're going to assume that you touched its skin.

524
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's going to feel inhuman.

525
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 But the creature's on top of him and he hears it purring faster and faster.

526
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 [imitates purring]

527
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Going faster and faster.

528
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He looks over and even though the room is red-orange, he can barely see anything.

529
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He looks over and on the table next to him is someone else being held down

530
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 by an inhuman shape.

531
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 [imitates purring]

532
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Next thing he knows, he's in his bedroom.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 His real bedroom.

534
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And he's standing there for a second.

535
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And then all of a sudden he doubles over with horrible excruciating abdominal pain.

536
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 He can pronounce the word.

537
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Horrible excruciating pain in his stomach.

538
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 [imitates excruciating pain]

539
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 My ab-dominable!

540
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 [imitates excruciating pain]

541
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 The roommates still don't check on him, right?

542
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 They're like, "Oh, he ate a Taco Bell. This is totally fine."

543
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He's like, "No, this isn't Taco Bell, you jerks."

544
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 [imitates excruciating pain]

545
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So, it's an interesting story.

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Obviously, it could be totally made up, right?

547
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 It could be totally made up.

548
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 It could also be a dream.

549
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 It's funny because, as I was reading it back to you,

550
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 a couple of things made me think of something we've covered before.

551
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Capgross delusion.

552
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I think that was the name of it.

553
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Where you see people but you don't believe they're actually the people.

554
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 You think your relatives have been placed with...

555
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 ...double-gangers.

556
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 So, you had an element of that.

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 This one had an inanimate version of it as well.

558
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 He walked into his room.

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 It was his room, but he didn't recognize it as his room.

560
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 That's an odd detail, but his sister and his mom coming in,

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 him not recognizing them.

562
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I think the creepiest detail outside of the being lifted up by your genitals,

563
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 which is quite terrifying, which is a terrifying detail,

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 is the grandma.

565
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 We want to believe that when we pass away, we find peace.

566
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 We want to believe in some sort of afterlife.

567
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And while that may be true in a reality where aliens are able to distort space and time,

568
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 where they're able to abduct people out of rooms,

569
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 create clones, teleport people, create missing time, false memories,

570
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 if an alien race had that level of technology,

571
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 would it be possible for them to exist between reality and the afterlife?

572
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Is it possible that all these stories of being abducted onto aliens' spaceships,

573
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 they're actually not on a physical spaceship as we would know it,

574
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 but what religious scholars would describe as purgatory?

575
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 A place where the rules don't apply, where time doesn't apply, where physics don't apply.

576
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 There's been talk, it's actually a very popular theory, that aliens are actually demons.

577
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And this story kind of leans in that way.

578
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 You have the deception, you have that trying to get permission from the person

579
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 to do these things, just lay on the bed.

580
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Obviously they have the technology to just put them on the bed,

581
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 because that's what they did at the end, but first they try to get him to do it willingly.

582
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And in this purgatory, you have not only shapeshifters, supernatural beings,

583
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 but you have your own loved ones there as well, begging for your life.

584
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 A human soul is everlasting, but so is an alien's curiosity about the human race.

585
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 This grandma offered herself up to be experimented on.

586
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Those aliens took her up on that offer.

587
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So while Nick goes through life, he may remember that moment,

588
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 remember that time his grandmother offered herself up to save him.

589
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And think, "Grandma, I know you're out there, you're looking down on me.

590
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 I've hope you've found some peace."

591
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 But what he doesn't realize is the only thing his grandma is looking at,

592
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 is the cold black eyes of her alien doctors.

593
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 As they begin to run another test on her, a single tear drops.

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 She thought she loved her grandson more than anything,

595
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 but as the drill bit enters her head and they begin to experiment X974,

596
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 she realizes there are limits to a grandmother's love for her kids.

597
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 She wished she had known that before she asked the aliens to take her instead.

598
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But I don't want to end it on a depressing ending, so we kick in the door,

599
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 purr on this, start shooting on aliens, like I don't even get the reference,

600
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I wasn't one of the purring ones, you can blow on them.

601
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Come on grandma, let's go.

602
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Me? Yeah, you're the only grandma here.

603
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 You gotta give her a piggyback ride out, her legs don't work so well,

604
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 so she's on your back, Daimon has the carbonic copter outside the UFO,

605
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 hurry up hold your breath, it's gonna be a jump, so we jump out of the UFO,

606
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 we jump into the carbonic copter, we save Nick's grandma, her soul is fine,

607
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I didn't want to end on a sad ending, so we saved the universe.

608
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 The aliens are probably gonna come and get you tonight, though,

609
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 because she stole a grandma's ghost-- hey, that's on you, that's on you, right?

610
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I just do the episodes, I just created the situation where now purring sex pervert aliens

611
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 are gonna probably get you tonight, not me, because I got a date with a ghost grandma,

612
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 so I'm gonna be real busy tonight.
