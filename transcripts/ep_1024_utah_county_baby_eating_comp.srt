1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
 World famous actor and wrestler, The Rock, has not been seen in public recently.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,560
 Is it because he's taken a little bit of time off, or is it because he has no more

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,680
 legs? His legs fell off. This is an actual conspiracy theory. Does The Rock

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:34,120
 still have his legs? It's so bizarre. And then, and then we travel to Utah to take

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 a look at one of the most bizarre press conferences in recent memory where the

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,120
 Utah County Attorney took the stage and proclaimed he does not eat babies. Today

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:02,400

 stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away. First off, walking into

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,760
 Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Well, I just

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,880
 saw the way out to Hollywood.

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,840
 Taking that beautiful blimp out. Hopefully they don't get shot down. Hopefully

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,120
 no one thinks it's from China. I'm gonna say this for this first story. I came

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,120
 across this conspiracy theory and it was so ridiculous that I did not say I

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,320
 didn't actually like archive it, which is what I normally do. Like I'll archive it

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,040
 or I'll release bookmark it so I can go back to it. I saw this and I was so

26
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,440
 perplexed by it, but I go this also so ridiculous. I'm not gonna talk about this

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,640
 on my podcast and little did I know that then for the next two three weeks I've

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,000
 been thinking about this. Almost non-stop. Almost non-stop. To the point that I

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
 originally wasn't even gonna cover this segment for this episode. I had something

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,040
 else ready to go and I said I have to cover this. I have to cover this now

31
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,160
 because then it will be funnier when it turns out not to be true, but who knows?

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,800
 Who knows in the world of conspiracy theory? Let's take a look at this and

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,400
 please to all of the internet sensors out there. They keep a pretty good hands-

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,200
 off thing to the podcast. Now that we're not not on YouTube, I can talk a lot

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,240
 about different stuff, but I'm not saying that this conspiracy theory is true. I'm

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,600
 just saying I find it highly amusing. Let's take a look at it. It involves human

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,840
 grief and suffering. This conspiracy theory starts off like this. There is...

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,280
 This is super interesting because I do have to kind of lay this out. Blood

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,040
 clots. Blood clots are a thing. Originally people just thought they were

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,640
 words shouted out by Jamaican rappers, but it turns out that blood clots can

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,040
 actually happen to you or me. I thought I might have had blood clots last week

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,240
 because I was showing symptoms of having blood clots. Now you can get blood clots

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,600
 from all sorts of different things, but two things that can give you blood clots.

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,240
 I will say that to varying degrees, okay, to varying degrees, you can get blood

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,360
 clots. You can have blood clotting problems from COVID-19 itself. And I

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,360
 actually went and I found a medical journal that stated that before the

47
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,520
 first vaccines are ever rolled out. The earliest thing we have about COVID

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,840
 causing blood clots, and it's very rare, but there was a paper published in June

49
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,200
 of 2020. So this was way before the vaccine rollout. COVID-19 causes blood

50
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,840
 clots. There have also, despite the fact that people were told no, no, no, everything

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,440
 safe, there have also been in a very small amount of cases blood clots caused by

52
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,160
 vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines. So both of those things can be true. They're both very

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,640
 rare, but we have had documented cases of people getting blood clots from

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,320
 vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines, and we've had people getting blood clots who were

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,400
 not vaccinated from COVID-19 itself. So both of those things can be true at the

56
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,360
 same time. I'll put all those links in the show notes. What we're looking at here

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,240
 is this conspiracy theory is coming from the COVID-19's cause blood clots and

58
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,320
 it's going to wipe out humanity. The COVID-19's are actually a plot to

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,880
 depopulate the planet Earth. That's where we're at in this conspiracy theory. So

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
 you figure everyone who's got the COVID-19 vaccine at one point is going to die

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,960
 according to this conspiracy theory. See, this is what I get to talk about when I'm

62
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,160
 not on YouTube. Spotify might have a problem with this as well. I'm not saying

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,760
 this conspiracy theory is true. I don't think the vaccines were a depopulation

64
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,160
 agent at all. I don't think that's what they were designed for. But this

65
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,520
 conspiracy theory comes out of that and this, this is a fantastic conspiracy

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,160
 theory. It's someone who loves to study conspiracy theories because you can

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,200
 never be wrong. People who believe this conspiracy theory, what we're about to

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,960
 get into right now, they can't be wrong. Let's go back to, and again I didn't plan

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,320
 on doing this, but I can't stop thinking about it. Recently Jeremy Renner, actor,

70
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,800
 guy, he was in a bunch of stuff, his Marvel movies and born identity stuff.

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,300
 Anyways, Jeremy Renner is writing a snow plow at his property and from what we

72
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,280
 understand he got out of the snow plow. This wasn't like a Charlie Brown snow

73
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,200
 plow pulled by a puppy. This was a man, this was basically like an industrial

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,040
 snow plow. He had all of the, I guess he loves heavy equipment. He has all these

75
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 different vehicles that he used at his own property to plow his own snow because

76
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,160
 he liked it. People go he's so rich, he could have hired someone to do it. Why

77
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,000
 was he snow plowing that day? Well anyways, he was snow plowing that day. Maybe

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,560
 he gets off on it. Maybe it's his fetish, I don't know. But he was snow plowing that

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,080
 day and it basically rolled over on him. It kind of chewed him up. And he's doing

80
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,160
 okay. We've just never, and it's none of our business at the end of the day. It's

81
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,160
 his own private medical stuff, but it's never been released and the early

82
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,440
 reports was like he sustained massive damage to his lower body. And it was a

83
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,840
 giant piece of equipment. So that would make sense. That popped up really quickly

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,760
 in the conspiracy theory community. People go oh that's not what happened.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,720
 That's a cover story because Jeremy Renner's legs fell off due to blood

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,840
 clots. He took the COVID-19 vaccine and he got blood clots in his legs and they

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,960
 fell off. And the Hollywood elite, the media was like how are we going to explain

88
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,240
 how we're going to explain that this Marvel superhero no longer has legs.

89
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
 I know we're going to crash him with this giant piece of machinery. But I guess the

90
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,480
 story is he never got crushed in the first place. Forget all the medical

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,720
 you know people seeing the helicopter come down in the area. No those are the

92
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,360
 blood clots. The blood clots were flying the helicopter. He had blood clots in his

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,200
 legs. They had to remove one or both legs and people go people are going to

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,720
 wonder where his legs went. So the snow cloud was a cover story. And I remember

95
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,480
 reading that back when it happened. Then I go okay I mean there would be quite the

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,760
 cover story. It would make sense. You would wonder why your favorite actor no

97
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,720
 longer had legs. If just one of the day he just didn't have legs. You would

98
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,280
 wonder a good cover story. But I don't I wish Jeremy the best. I wish Jeremy's best

99
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,200
 recovery. We don't know how bad the injuries are. At the end of the day it's

100
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,360
 really none of our business. Like I don't need to know the HIV status of a

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,720
 celebrity or whether or not Jeremy Renner has legs. That's his business. I mean

102
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,920
 obviously we would find out eventually. But I read that. I go that makes sense. I

103
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,000
 could see the conspiracy theory community looking at that accident and say

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,480
 no it was blood clots and they had explained was Lake's fellow. But then

105
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,560
 recently I'm going to scour my computer database. My history. My bookmarks. I did

106
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,320
 last night but I'm gonna look even harder. Because maybe about two weeks ago I

107
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,200
 found a new conspiracy theory that says the rock famous wrestler Dwayne the

108
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
 rock Johnson star of Fast and Furious and what was that other movie he was

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,260
 recently in that I saw. Oh Black Adam I enjoyed that. Star of all these movies the

110
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,800
 mummy returns or the mummy's back whatever one that was and his legs are

111
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 gone. His legs are gone. And you go wait I don't remember. I don't remember

112
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,000
 how in any snow how did he lose his legs. Well apparently this conspiracy theory

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,040
 is blood clots took his legs off like here is a guy who's peak fitness right

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,240
 he lifts a lot and you out of everyone to not lose their legs due to blood clots

115
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,640
 you would assume it was the healthiest. But that's not how blood clots work. But

116
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,080
 apparently they don't matter if you're healthy or not. Well here's the thing

117
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,040
 let's back up I don't know if the rock still has his legs. This conspiracy

118
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,920
 theory started going around that the reason so this all came out of this all

119
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,560
 came out of one thing so the rock was supposed to or there was a rumor that

120
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,720
 the rock was gonna wrestle at a upcoming WrestleMania like 38 or 39. It's gonna be

121
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,200
 a huge return. Black Adam didn't do that well. His vision for the future DC movies

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,920
 got swept aside. Henry Cavill was fired. All this stuff. And so he's like fine if

123
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,280
 I can't make movies I'm gonna spend some time wrestling I'm gonna go back and do

124
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,200
 what I love. He was or that's the rumor right we don't know for sure that he was

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,920
 gonna make this appearance. Well his I think they're cousins his cousin Roman

126
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,800
 Reigns who's another wrestler recently went on a talk show and he said he

127
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,640
 squashed the rumors and he goes the rock will not be wrestling at a upcoming

128
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,520
 WrestleMania and the host is like why. And Roman goes he's not in wrestling shape.

129
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,280
 And everyone kind of laughs at that because again he's so fit right he's so

130
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,480
 fit. And Roman goes there's a difference between being in shape and being in

131
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,400
 wrestling shape because in wrestling shape you know it's it's super acrobatic

132
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,200
 you're doing all this cardio you're picking people up throwing them over

133
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,000
 your head if you're just muscular and you're kind of flexing your muscles for

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,680
 movie he's spoiled the rumor he's not actually flying around in Black Adam

135
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,680
 he's just walking around and then everything else is special thanks you're

136
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,920
 like what I didn't know that I thought that was documentary. He's not in shape

137
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,640
 he's not in shape to wrestle and out of that statement a conspiracy theory was

138
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,160
 born. The real reason why the rock won't wrestle at WrestleMania 38 or 39

139
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,400
 whichever one it is is because he doesn't have legs anymore. Now this

140
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,080
 conspiracy theory was put forward by someone said he was a member of the

141
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,400
 Rocks Inner Circle he was the stone he was just a stone on the side and he goes

142
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,000
 listen I'm a member of Rocks Inner Circle and I got to tell you the rock

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,040
 doesn't have legs anymore he had been feeling ill for a while and he had the

144
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,280
 blood clots in his legs and it was too late to they saved his life they had to

145
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,680
 remove his legs so that's why he's not in wrestling shape you do I'm sure there

146
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,680
 are wrestlers without legs honestly worldwide throughout the history of

147
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,680
 wrestling I'm sure there are wrestlers without legs but again it would be

148
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,360
 shocking if the Rock showed up to WrestleMania 38 and he didn't have legs

149
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,020
 people would wonder about that people would really be confused and so that's

150
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
 why he's there I mean they don't have an answer for that right they're not like

151
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,520
 the Undertaker took them and if he wins the Rage and the Cage match the

152
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,880
 Undertaker will give them back nothing like that you're gonna build them into

153
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,640
 the storyline his just legs are gone so instead of confronting Matt until they

154
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,000
 can come up with a good story they're just gonna say the Rock's not ready to

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,160
 wrestle. What I love about this conspiracy first off this is a great

156
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,060
 conspiracy theory because it is built on people's fears the idea of getting

157
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,740
 blood clots like I said I had to deal with that last week and maybe that's why

158
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,860
 the story's been so in my mind but I had to deal with that last week and I don't

159
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,380
 know blood clots but there was a concern about it because I was having

160
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,900
 symptoms that I had never had before and the only thing they pointed to was

161
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,780
 blood clots there was no we still don't know what it is it might be like a

162
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,940
 nerve issue but the only thing was I kept getting these warm sensations in my

163
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,800
 legs couldn't figure it out so they said let's just test you for blood clots

164
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,560
 it's scary right whether or not you've gotten the vaccine you could be afraid

165
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,080
 that you're gonna get blood clots from the vaccine you can be afraid you're

166
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,920
 gonna get blood clots from COVID or both right it's nothing exists in a vacuum so

167
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,760
 it's scary - it's super efficient this is a great conspiracy theory because you

168
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,920
 never have to be proven right or wrong on it this conspiracy theory is

169
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,980
 constructed in such a way that if now you see the rock with both of his legs

170
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,220
 it's Hollywood magic they're fake they're CGI legs someone else is holding him up

171
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,380
 and walking behind them in a green suit and then they just you know give them

172
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,180
 give him legs give him computer graphic legs there you go people will say have

173
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,320
 you ever seen the rock in person have you ever touch his legs to make sure

174
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,640
 your hands didn't pass through them are you sure it's not some sort of lawn mower

175
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,680
 man-like illusion you never have to be proven wrong if Jeremy Renner has not

176
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,640
 lost his legs or at least the use of them it would be a miracle from how this

177
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,400
 injury was described this giant vehicle rolling over on his lower half and I

178
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,460
 remember when I you know because the news it was in the news for a while I was

179
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,460
 thinking about it and I thought on obviously if he lost one or both of his

180
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,540
 legs you would just whatever the audience would be like whatever they'd CGI

181
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,860
 them in you still want to carry the character of Hawkeye along I know he had

182
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,980
 another television show called like the mayor of boomtown or town of the boom

183
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,580
 something like that you just haven't sitting in a chair the whole time because

184
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,680
 he's like just like a journalist or mayor mayor maybe maybe he's the town itself

185
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 maybe the entire movie takes place on his chest I don't know but you would have

186
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,360
 you just haven't sitting down and you can have in a show being like yeah he lost

187
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,040
 his leg you could easily work that into a drama a superhero show you would kind of

188
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,080
 want to explain it I don't know maybe King shot him with a beam nobody would

189
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,680
 care we'd obviously feel bad that he went through it but he's fine right he's

190
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,980
 fine and they would just CGI stuff in because they would have an explanation

191
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,540
 for it I do believe that this piece of machinery rolled over on not Ron Jeremy

192
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,340
 it's a whole different story but Jeremy Renner the rock thing if he just all

193
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,900
 of a sudden didn't have legs it would be weird because they would have to explain

194
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,740
 it and what would you how would you explain the rock not having legs I

195
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,780
 think you probably don't have to he probably has both of his legs but he has

196
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:16,280
 been AWOL for a while now it's been a couple weeks after the whole DCU getting

197
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,640
 shut down and the black Adam movie I enjoyed it but it didn't do as well as

198
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:28,120
 it could have and then the wrestling he hasn't been seen publicly apparently

199
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,240
 for like three weeks so that's why these rumors are getting born and it kind of

200
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,080
 sucks right like you want a vacation you're the rock you want a vacation

201
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,120
 but you decide just stay inside right lift weights maybe maybe just keep doing

202
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,380
 that thing that you always do and no one sees you so then the rumor goes around

203
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:53,380
 that your legs are gone that's a pretty bizarre rumor to start but again if he's

204
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,940
 seen in public it can easily be hand-waved away with Hollywood magic and

205
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,580
 then from going forward when anyone famous isn't seen for a while their legs

206
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,780
 fell off that will be the conspiracy that's the reason why you don't see them

207
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,080
 anymore because they don't have legs they're working on a cover story for it

208
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,360
 and it's here's the thing I wanted to cover the first off I wish I had sick

209
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
 because when I first read it I just was like this is insane this is almost too

210
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:28,280
 insane to talk about but then I thought what if what if what if he did that we

211
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,680
 never see him again and then that would just be weird right just you never saw

212
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,120
 the rock again but then I thought if rock shows up tomorrow and he has both of his

213
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,020
 legs no one would care right everyone be like yeah that's kind of what I assumed

214
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,700
 seen him a couple weeks he had legs and now he has legs but I wanted to record

215
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,860
 this before he shows back up in public because I'm telling you whether or not

216
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,740
 he wouldn't that be insane I know his mom got in a car accident the other night

217
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,220
 I was reading that headline but they didn't mention it mention I read the

218
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,820
 article and at no point did they mention whether or not the rocks still had his

219
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,160
 legs it's very lazy journalism TMZ if he doesn't show up it'll be intriguing

220
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,000
 that would be a mystery right if the rock just disappeared that's a totally

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 different story but then the idea that what if you know you listen to this

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,640
 episode and you chuckle along as well if you want subscribe you're like dude

223
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,480
 this is going way too nuts I'll finish listening to this segment and then like

224
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,000
 two or three days after this podcast comes out the rock gets an horrible

225
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,460
 accident right loses his legs such a bizarre story I mean I'm not making fun

226
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,660
 of like Jeremy Renner in his vehicle that's horrible I just think it's so

227
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,820
 weird that people can go oh no that's a cover story really it was a blood clots

228
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,540
 it's blood clots all the way down when anything bad happens to a celebrity and

229
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,380
 you don't see him for a while his blood clots their legs have fallen off

230
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,780
 fascinating look at the world of conspiracy theory Kaz Montague and he

231
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,120
 keep an eye on the rock keep an eye on the rocks career maybe that was the rock

232
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,640
 post that's where people would go see his next movie just make sure he still has

233
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,320
 legs all the trailers are just him from the waist up and people are like hmm

234
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,520
 I got a ticket I got my tickets find out for sure Kaz Montague let's go ahead and

235
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,800
 touch you the keys to the carbon or copper we are leaving behind Holly weird

236
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,960
 which is what I call it let's leave behind Holly weird fly us all the way out

237
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:39,620
 to Utah and we're standing outside this building just like you know like a

238
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,860
 governmental building there's a press conference getting ready to be held

239
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,060
 grab your camera and a little press pass we're like pushing past the other

240
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,820
 pushing past the other real reporters you're like get out of the way conspiracy

241
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,980
 theorists we have priority and pushing them aside or getting right up to the

242
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:02,040
 front it's June 1st 2022 and we're here for this just absolutely insane press

243
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,200
 conference but at the time none of the reporters here thought what was about to

244
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,800
 possibly come out of this guy's mouth this guy is the Utah County Attorney

245
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,320
 David Levitt he's like the lead attorney for the county and he gets up to the

246
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,240
 podium and he's the one who called the press conference in the first place and

247
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,700
 he begins to speak now for context let's go back to just about a month earlier

248
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,540
 it's May 2022 and the Utah County Sheriff Mike Smith he says my office we're

249
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,660
 gonna reopen this case we've had some new developments about a cold case that

250
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,900
 we've never really stopped working but we just didn't go anywhere we're gonna

251
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,900
 reopen it we are going to look into allegations of ritualistic sex abuse

252
00:20:51,900 --> 00:21:02,040
 between 1990 and 2010 he says this sex abuse of children ritualistic sex

253
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,480
 abuse of children was spread across several counties including Utah County

254
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,640
 Jawab County and San Pete County these stories are just like the stories

255
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,320
 coming out of the satanic panic as the media has dubbed it back in the 80s but

256
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,020
 we believe that we actually have new proof that these weren't just stories

257
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,460
 this wasn't just a moral panic that the children in these communities were

258
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:39,180
 molested on a wide and ritualistic scale wasn't just some creepy teacher or a

259
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,740
 neighbor luring kids in with candy this was an organized effort and it was

260
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,720
 super creepy it was like creepier than the normal stuff right Utah County Sheriff

261
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 Mike Smith reopens this case in 2022 almost 30 years since the first

262
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,200
 allegations came out so on June 1st 2022 Utah County Attorney David Levitt

263
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,640
 calls this press conference and I need to see if I find an audio clip of it I

264
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,580
 really I'm really trying to find an audio clip but from what the basically

265
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,740
 from what the articles have stated David Levitt gets up on the stand then

266
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,940
 after a few pleasantries like hey everyone thanks for coming out to this

267
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,340
 press conference if you don't know my name is David Levitt I'm the Utah County

268
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:39,900
 Attorney and I do not eat babies my wife does not eat babies we have never eaten

269
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:48,600
 babies we are not currently eating babies and we never will eat babies any

270
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,000
 questions and then the reporters had no idea this was gonna happen the

271
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
 report really yeah we have nothing but questions what are you talking about

272
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,520
 why would you call the press conference to say you don't eat babies like this

273
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,800
 I never thought you ate baby until you called 30 people in my room to

274
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,440
 proclaim you don't eat babies and your wife doesn't eat babies David Levitt

275
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,280
 says here's why I'm bringing this up now here's why I feel like I have to defend

276
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,440
 myself against all these baby eat now like no one's no one's alleging that

277
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,360
 not a single person in this room has ever heard what you're talking about

278
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,760
 reporters are like what in the world he goes David Levitt goes it's an election

279
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,000
 year and my seed is one of the things people are gonna be voting on and Mike

280
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,920
 Smith the Utah County Sheriff is taking sides because you see he's dredging up

281
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,040
 all of these old charges you know I reopened that case last month about

282
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,800
 ritualistic sex abuse he's trying to let you and the voters know that me and my

283
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,720
 wife used to eat babies but we never ate babies so this is an election year

284
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,520
 ploy honestly I think Mike Smith should step down for such a dirty trick I

285
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:17,160
 think that this is wrong and I do want to record one more time that I David Levitt

286
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,520
 and my wife have never eaten babies

287
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,600
 so immediately there's basically a stampede of reporters from the press

288
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,800
 conference just like you see in those old movies where they'd run to like the

289
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,320
 pay phones real quick they all just ran into the other room and pulled out their

290
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,080
 cell phones and called the police department the Sheriff's Office and

291
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,000
 said are you investigating are you investigating attorney David Levitt

292
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,720
 for eating babies and the Sheriff's Office said no we're not we are looking

293
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,820
 into cases of ritualistic child sex abuse but we are not looking into the

294
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:05,000
 allegations of David Levitt eating babies the reason why this is such an

295
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,680
 overreaction because what happened was David said David Levitt says when I

296
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,120
 found out there he knew from back because this was investigated for a long

297
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,200
 time these these allegations were investigated the police didn't really

298
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,040
 have much to go on but the complaint was out there and there was a hundred and

299
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:33,100
 fifty one page report from a single witness and it had been sitting in the

300
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,740
 police department for a while this was in like I don't think it was like in the

301
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,220
 evidence locker but this high and you know Utah County attorney he's the

302
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,340
 highest attorney in the county he would have access to the evidence locker but

303
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,980
 he was able to get a copy of the hundred and fifty one page report that had been

304
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,640
 submitted years and years and years ago that names him and his wife and 15 other

305
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,320
 people who were part of this ritual sex abuse cult where it talked about them

306
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:15,240
 eating babies now the sheriff said we are not going to comment on who and who is

307
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,940
 not under investigation but we are not basing this new investigation off the

308
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,740
 hundred and fifty one page report because that is old I mean it's definitely

309
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,180
 creepy don't take it don't read it before you go to bed it's creepy and it's

310
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,380
 horrifying but that's not why we reopened the case we've had that for

311
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,900
 years and years and years that's not why we're reopening the case we have gotten

312
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,740
 new information a new victim has come forward and gave us stuff we didn't know

313
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,440
 previously and that is why we're reopening the investigation if David

314
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,840
 Levitt wants to walk around saying he's not eating babies which again not a lot

315
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,480
 of people even knew that was an allegation there was that report that

316
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,640
 hundred and fifty one page report but I don't think they gave copies to the press

317
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,360
 back when the investigation was going on he goes that is not our main focus now

318
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 however that hundred and fifty one page report does name because it named those

319
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,380
 15 people including the wife and the attorney it does name a guy named David

320
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:29,540
 Hamlin and this new focus when the police get this new victim and they start

321
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,600
 looking into this investigation that is who they are investigating is this guy

322
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,840
 named David Hamlin he was arrested in 1999 this this type of stuff really

323
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,120
 pisses me off this type of stuff really pisses me off and I think it pisses off

324
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,520
 most people David Hamlin I get it innocent until proven guilty all that

325
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,920
 stuff but David Hamlin he was a therapist he were he was arrested in

326
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,120
 1999 for child sex abuse so that was right remember this this ritualistic

327
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,200
 sex cult was doing stuff between 1990 and 2010 he was arrested in 1999 for child

328
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,280
 sex abuse 18 counts 18 counts doesn't necessarily mean 18 kids because each

329
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,240
 kid could be like three or four counts but still that's a lot that's a lot

330
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,680
 whether it's 18 victims or four victims and anyways the point is 18 counts is a

331
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:29,960
 lot he was arrested in 1999 charges were not officially filed until 2012 so he

332
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,880
 was arrested you hold him overnight for a couple days he paid pays bail and then

333
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,480
 he goes about his business as a therapist having these one-on-one

334
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,760
 conversations with people in a closed room from 1999 to 2012 the charges were

335
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,320
 not officially filed where now we're actually gonna have a trial and then in

336
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,600
 2014 all the charges were dropped

337
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:03,400
 now here's the thing he was on the list and David Levitt was on the list as

338
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,920
 being a member of this cult and I know your first question this was my question

339
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:14,480
 too was Levitt the Utah County attorney when these charges were dropped and he

340
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,440
 was not that actually happened five years before Levitt was the attorney so

341
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,560
 he started he became the Utah County attorney in 2019 so that does absolve

342
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,760
 him from him putting his thumb on the scale and saying hey I know this guy we

343
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,400
 kind of ritually abuse kids together we're gonna let him go so he had no

344
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,280
 point in that so you could look at David Levitt yeah anyone can be named on a

345
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,960
 list of all of these people maybe he knows maybe he doesn't even know David

346
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
 Hamlin right maybe someone was just picking prominent members of the

347
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,240
 community and they all just happened to be on the same list that's possible right

348
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,560
 it also you got to throw that one out the window because David Hamlin and David

349
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,120
 Hamlin both them named David I don't think there's anything there don't make

350
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,280
 people named David have to worry about it but David Levitt the attorney and

351
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,960
 David Hamlin the therapist were next door neighbors so now you have I mean

352
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,480
 again listen you might live next door to a pervert I hope not I hope not right I

353
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,320
 hope I don't either I know I don't but you might live next to a pervert and that

354
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,440
 pervert gets arrested that mean you had anything to do with it no not

355
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,960
 necessarily if your name appears in a an undated document that names you and 14

356
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,000
 other people including your wife of ritualistic sex abuse does that 100%

357
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,280
 mean you did that no I mean people can say all sorts of crazy things and that's

358
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,440
 kind of what the sheriff was saying he goes listen we have new evidence what

359
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,160
 happened we have new evidence against David Hamlin we're not gonna say whether

360
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,040
 or not we're investigating other people we never do but we think we have something

361
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,640
 to go on that we can actually make the charges stick this time David Levitt you

362
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,560
 know so remember he's being recharged in 2022 this story is happening in 2022

363
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,640
 where David Levitt's like no no I don't need babies I don't need babies so now we

364
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:13,640
 have a trial for what might be a co-conspirator right Hamlin and Levitt

365
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,240
 may be part of this child sex cult so people ask I mean nobody even thought

366
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,040
 that David Levitt had any connection to any of this until he started running his

367
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,800
 mouth about how he doesn't eat babies nobody would have put two and two

368
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,880
 together that old report the police weren't even using that as a piece of

369
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,760
 evidence they had their eyes on David Hamlin and then he put himself right in

370
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,760
 the middle of it David Levitt's like I don't need babies he says my office will

371
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:48,880
 prosecute David Hamlin to the fullest extent of the law in fact I actually

372
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,880
 prosecuted him not too long ago for killing a deer and eating its heart and

373
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
 drinking its blood that's the type of guy I am when my next door neighbor

374
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,760
 talking about you're saying this therapist ritualistically killed a deer

375
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,480
 and David Levitt goes yeah yeah I actually it was poaching that was the

376
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,280
 crime but he was eating deer hearts and drinking their blood in the middle of

377
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,480
 nowhere so you know that's kind of that's why you should read that's why you

378
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,160
 should reelect me I will prosecute my neighbors if they do disgusting stuff

379
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,760
 well again he wasn't being prosecuted for drinking blood he's being prosecuted

380
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,560
 for poaching a deer from it's all you right now if people suspect you of being

381
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,880
 a satanic child molester you might want to tamp down on the blood drinking just

382
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,640
 a little piece of advice maybe not drink so much blood

383
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,840
 so why is Levitt even getting caught up in any of this stuff I mean again sure he

384
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,400
 had a press conference where he declared once and for all he doesn't eat babies

385
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,080
 which you should just never do I mean obviously don't eat the babies but he

386
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,080
 thought he was getting in front of it and all of a sudden he made himself the

387
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,920
 story is that it is the fact that there's this undated report that names him

388
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,200
 along with a bunch of other people and someone who has been re-arrested for

389
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,320
 child molestation I mean that's a bad list to be on to begin with but is that

390
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,160
 all they have he had this weird press conference and he's an extra neighbors

391
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,840
 with a guy who drinks blood and molested kids we have these weird quotes and these

392
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,120
 weird decisions and this is where you kind of any of these in a vacuum you may

393
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:34,080
 be able to explain away but let's take a look at this stuff this first one there's

394
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,640
 a way to explain away honestly we don't have the context for it I found this

395
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,440
 quote and an article or two this is something David Levitt did say on the

396
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,080
 record like this is an actual quote from him I don't know what the context is but

397
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,920
 this is what he wrote there is no context I mean there might be a context but

398
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,160
 there are certain things when your brain goes I should say that that's a good

399
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:01,560
 example and then your brain goes don't just don't here's a quote he goes quote

400
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,280
 I mean how do you train a dog to roll over when it's time to roll over you do

401
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,200
 it by giving a reward and repetition that that's that's fair right stop there

402
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,840
 that's your brain's telling you to stop but David Levitt continues I mean how

403
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,880
 do you train a dog to roll over when it's time to roll over you do it by giving

404
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,680
 a reward and repetition he continues if a man wants to program some little girl

405
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:35,480
 to give him oral sex anytime he wants start young and give rewards it's the

406
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:44,320
 same way you help a child learn to make their bed what is the context for that

407
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,960
 what is the context for that I figured maybe he was talking about how groomers

408
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,800
 operate but the way he says it he goes this is how you teach a dog and then he

409
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,960
 goes off in this perverted and super specific example and then he goes yeah

410
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:10,120
 or make their bed one of the two that's creepy that's creepy and then when he

411
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:17,440
 came into again think about it he knows that he is part of this alleged

412
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,960
 child sex network he knows that that 151 page document names him so you kind of

413
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,040
 want to do stuff that that doesn't make that seem real when he got elected this

414
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:38,080
 is so boneheaded when he got elected as Utah County attorney he eliminated the

415
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,800
 special victims unit which was a dedicated team of detectives to

416
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:55,840
 investigate sex crimes that's all they did he closed it down he goes it wasn't

417
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,880
 working they found me in my co-conspirators I mean they made up that

418
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,840
 list he goes it wasn't working these I think it was eight detectives it was

419
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,680
 like four to eight detectives he goes they were overworked there's so much sex

420
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,880
 abuse going on they were overworked and I was afraid they were going to burn out

421
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,360
 so I canceled it and then just made every every police officer do a little bit of

422
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,280
 sex crime stuff I kind of you know spread it spread the madness out and the

423
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,880
 police and therapists and all these other people said listen before police

424
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,840
 especially if a beat officer saw something that was weird a patrolman

425
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,320
 stops the car and sees something that was weird he would then go to the SVU and

426
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,320
 say hey I don't know if this is real or what but XYZ and the special victims

427
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,520
 unit would go that actually sounds like a a that actually sounds like there

428
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,360
 could be possible real child abuse going on there or it could be something where

429
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,560
 they go yeah that's kind of we've seen that before that's actually not child

430
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,960
 sex abuse that's something different I mean you know what I mean like you would

431
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,240
 have these experts and people said the experts were gone now everyone just did

432
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,960
 a little bit of it you spread it across and David Levitt said all replaced was

433
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,360
 something better and he never did imagine you've been accused of sexually

434
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,240
 abusing kids for 20 years as part of some weird cult and then you shut down

435
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,280
 the second you're like I'm totally innocent and to prove it I'm gonna shut

436
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,120
 down experts investigating sex crimes I'm gonna let everyone do a little bit of

437
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,120
 it so nobody's perfect at it so remember this was an election year and

438
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:44,560
 obviously none of this stuff looked good for David Levitt he ended up losing the

439
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:53,720
 election the other guy got 73% of the vote so it he basically destroyed his

440
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,200
 own career he thought he was getting out in front of this by proclaiming it as an

441
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,200
 eight babies and then all of a sudden everyone needed to know what that was

442
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,520
 the sheriff said I was never investigating that in the first place we

443
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,920
 are investigating this Hamlin character he has been recharged just in

444
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,800
 September 2022 David Hamlin so that process is playing out now and the

445
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,120
 sheriff has said Sheriff Mike Smith has said our focus after this new allegation

446
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,200
 was against David Hamlin we do believe we have enough now to charge him

447
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,040
 successfully and there are more arrests coming we're not gonna say who we're

448
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,720
 looking at we're not gonna say who we're not looking at but expect us to arrest

449
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,640
 more people involved in this activity very shortly

450
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,960
 super bizarre story right I mean it's that that collision of true crime

451
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,160
 conspiracy and the paranormal right that they say it was this ritualistic sex

452
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,920
 quote they don't use a lot of words like satanic because it gets kind of brought

453
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,120
 into that satanic panic thing but a group of 15 powerful people even before

454
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,520
 David Levitt became the Utah County attorney you have to wield some power

455
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,960
 just to be able to get up to that level anyways and let me say to allegedly

456
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,480
 right he may not have done we definitely know he didn't eat babies he proclaimed

457
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:29,720
 it but fascinating story of local politics local power and lust to such a

458
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,720
 degree that you pray on children you pray on the helpless to get off and what I

459
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,400
 be really interested in seeing this 151 page report because I what were the

460
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,360
 actual allegations back then but I'm telling you this is something I do not

461
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,640
 and I use it I use the term to just because it's a catch-all thing but the

462
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:54,400
 idea of the satanic panic you see article after article and they're almost

463
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
 joking about it they're like oh yeah I remember when all of those weirdo

464
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,640
 conservative Christians thought there was a saint worship or hiding around

465
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,520
 every tree and their children weren't safe and that it you'll see articles like

466
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,880
 that like remember when yeah I remember it and you know what some of it was real

467
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,600
 some of it was real I don't think all of it was real but I don't think none of it

468
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:23,120
 was real either and we have cases like this that 151 page report there may be a

469
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,000
 lot of exaggeration in it I'm not saying that reports a hundred percent

470
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,200
 authentic but just across the United States you had a time period from the

471
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,680
 1970s into the 1990s where you have these allegations of and this is what I

472
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,080
 find we got to wrap it up because otherwise I'll go forever about this but

473
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,920
 we have allegations of medium-sized groups of people right 10 to 15 to 20

474
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,000
 people in a local community abusing children in a ritualistic way even if

475
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,680
 you got rid of the ritualistic part even if someone goes well you know the

476
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,440
 satanic the satanic elements they were a little overblown those children were

477
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,880
 abused though you were right there sir that's just as bad even if you removed

478
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,240
 the window dressing even if you had an investigation to go well they weren't

479
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,120
 saying worshipers but they did run a child human trafficking scheme that's not

480
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,640
 satanic panic that's a crime and those people should be prosecuted and I think

481
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,680
 there was this big hand-waving motion about oh look at how the fundamentalists

482
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,200
 wore back then because that's really the narrative right they thought there was a

483
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,960
 saint worshiper behind every tree not every tree yeah there were some people

484
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,560
 who over blew the accusations they made it into this whole thing but again to

485
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,080
 say that none of it happened and the weirdest thing is it's like we know

486
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:47,560
 this type of stuff happens today so why do they just hand wave away everything

487
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,520
 that happened in the 70s the 80s and the 90s we know that there are organized

488
00:41:52,520 --> 00:42:00,120
 groups of people who trade photos and video and bodies of young children they

489
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:05,000
 have these networks we know these exist so why is it so some ABC reporter some

490
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,800
 high-level award-winning ABC journalists just got arrested for possession and

491
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:20,200
 trading of child porn so I mean like it exists that happens and to hand wave it

492
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,840
 all the way and say it's all made up I just don't buy that I don't buy that

493
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,640
 and then we get a little example like this you know this is that entire

494
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:39,320
 movement distilled into a moment remove all of the trappings remove the

495
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,680
 pentagrams and the inverted crosses if you take all of that out of those reports

496
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:54,200
 the allegations themselves are disgusting and damning 100% and I've always

497
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,920
 been of the belief this has always been my view of the satanic panic if you were

498
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,200
 a part of this just you were a bunch of sickos right you wanted to do sick stuff

499
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,880
 you would make it fantastical not because you're bored and not because you

500
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,960
 want to add a little pizzazz to your dungeon but you would do crazy things

501
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,680
 you would have like these weird imagery that you have the upside down crosses and

502
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,880
 the pentagrams and you would come in and you would be like look at these pigs

503
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,560
 look at these pigs we've killed throwing guts on people and then just do what you

504
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,120
 normally do to your victims do that normal awful sex stuff because you know

505
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,320
 if they ever do tell the story about what happened they're gonna be like yeah

506
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,720
 and then like there are all these dead pigs and he threw guts at me the whole

507
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,600
 room was painted red and it had all this stuff and people are gonna go that's not

508
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,240
 true you're exaggerating that's not true you make the

509
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,080
 outlaw gate you make the scenario so ridiculous that boil it down to the crime

510
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,740
 just like the guy drinking deer blood I don't care about that the fact that he

511
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:07,040
 was poaching deer that's the crime forget all the other wackadoodle stuff

512
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,920
 that's going on look at the crime was that crime committed yes or no that's

513
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,600
 something that people who dismiss the satanic panic always do they dismiss the

514
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:25,600
 crime it's so bizarre to me army hammer can get cancelled over Instagram post

515
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,520
 about him wanting to eat human ribs which he posted which he said sure is

516
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:38,940
 that a crime no not pro army hammer on this show but I do think he wants to

517
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,300
 eat people honestly but what I'm saying is somebody says something like that they

518
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,100
 can lose their career but you can have allegation after allegation after

519
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,100
 allegation against powerful members in your community people just dismiss it

520
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,340
 all because there is a pentagram in the background while they were abusing you

521
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:02,000
 it's absolutely nuts absolutely nuts the way they look at it but here we got a

522
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,160
 look at a case that may actually be one of the verifiable real cases coming out

523
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,880
 of the satanic panic and will we know more

524
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,680
 well I guess we'll find out if they arrest more people but I'll say this if I

525
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:31,580
 was ex Utah County Attorney David Levitt I'd be a very very nervous man right

526
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:39,980
 now because he must know that the sheriff has their eyes on him
