1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Cursed media isn't often talked about subject in the world of the paranormal.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,000
 And most of the times we have never found any proof of this, but...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is there any truth to the story that when a popular Japanese cartoon was finally cancelled,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 thousands of people died?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Then we travel to a hospital to meet a war veteran who now has a job in his civilian life as a security guard.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And part of his job entails him working in the morgue of this hospital.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Now this young man thought he had seen all the brutalities that humans could inflict on each other.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 But what happens when he comes face to face with brutalities from the darkest reaches of hell?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm a war hero.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 [Music]

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Let's go ahead and give this episode started. First stop walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give a big round of applause for our newest feature on supporter, Lunaris.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in Lunaris walking into Dead Rabbit Command looking spiffy and that...

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I don't know, brand new hat. I'm assuming at some point you got a hat.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Lunaris, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Just help spread the word about this show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Also, I want to let you guys know, you guys know that a lot of times I'm on that show, the Asylum Case Studies.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It's Tressa's podcast where she brings on different guests and we watch those sci-fi channel asylum films.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 It's a great podcast and I was once again invited onto the show where we watched Mega Piranha. It's awful.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It was one of the biggest chores I've had. It was even worse than the Insane Clown Posse movie.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Mega Piranha, if you want to check that episode out, I'll put it in the links.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 She has a whole ton of episodes if you're into people sitting around talking trash about people's works,

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 people's hearts and souls and dreams being put into celluloid.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We're just gonna laugh at it. We're gonna laugh at it for an hour. Mega Piranha was bad.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Mega Piranha was so bad, so check out the Asylum Case Studies if you can't get enough Jason this week.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Check that out. Lunaris, let's go ahead and toss you the Hair Hang glider.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We're gonna jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna glide all the way out to Japan.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 This story started, and I'm sorry that we're doing all of these introductions.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I want to give a shout out to the person who told me about this story. They didn't directly tell me.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 They didn't knock on my door, they didn't send me an email.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 There's a YouTube channel called Shibuna Laguna. It's a brand new channel.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I think they have like under 100 subs. And what Shibuna Laguna does, it's about anime stuff.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's about Japanese culture and it's kind of like weird spooky stuff.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And he recently posted a video called "Fore-Shocking Anime Urban Legends." I had never heard of this story before.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So if you're into the world of anime, you really may want to check that channel out. I definitely subbed to that channel.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Let's go back to the early 1980s. We're walking around the streets of Kobe.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And we see like a display of all these television sets. And there's like a little cartoon of like a robot punching a penguin.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And then there's like a cartoon of a guy turning into a motorcycle or something.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And then there's a cartoon of this little girl going...

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 She's like waving her wand around and we're like, "That's weird. Why is everyone paying attention to this?"

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 This one, this little girl one. I mean, we just saw a robot beat up a raccoon.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I mean a penguin. We just saw a robot beat up a penguin. That's way cooler.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Magical Princess Minky Momo was this cartoon that came out in the early 1980s.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Specifically, year 1982. And this was really... It's considered one of the prototypical what's called "magical girl."

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's like a subgenre of anime. My familiarity with this subculture is pretty limited.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I used to watch anime as a kid, but it was like Akira and Macross and Nazaka. Like the big budget stuff.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 But Minky Momo, I guess Sailor Moon would probably be considered a magical girl.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Minky Momo was one of the original magical girl animes. It also kind of set the trends because the people who made the cartoon, it was by Ashi Productions.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I probably mispronounced that because probably mispronounced on that. I just imagine there's dust everywhere.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Ashi Productions, they made it and the team specifically that worked on Minky Momo, they found out really early on that they had two audiences.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The little girl audience, which is what they were looking for. And then like 50 year old men.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And they're like, "Are you kidding me?" They first saw the demographics, they're like, "No, no, your show's doing really great."

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Among school aged girls and 50 year old men. And they really didn't like that.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Because they knew why 50 year old men were watching the show.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 They're like, "We really love these intriguing plot lines." The writers were like, "What plot lines?"

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Every episode is exactly the same. So Minky Momo apparently is about this little girl who comes from some other dimension.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Like the dream world or something like that. She comes to Earth and she meets these two...

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 She meets this childless couple, right? This husband and this wife who don't have a kid.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And she hangs out and each episode basically a problem is presented and everyone's like, "Oh no, how will we get through this wacky situation?"

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And then she uses her powers and the situations resolved.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So it's a very, very formulaic show.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So it's not like the 50 year old men are watching it because they like the complexity.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The richness of the universe or anything like that.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 It's a girl wearing a short skirt.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So anyway, but that's not what the story is. The story's not news alert. There's perverts in Japan.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Can you believe that? Next story.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 The story has an even... I don't want to say darker because perverts are pretty dark.

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 But this story has a weird choice. So what happened was this cartoon came out.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And it was extremely popular. It was an extremely popular cartoon.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 The problem was it wasn't selling enough merchandise.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Like the toy line behind it was sitting on the shelves, which would make sense if you had a lot of adults watching it.

75
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They're not going out and buying the compact mirror case and the little purse and the shoes and stuff like that because it's all made for little girls.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And Ashi Productions kept telling the Miki Momo team, "You gotta do something about this."

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Like, this totally isn't working. You have to move this merchandise.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But what are they going to do? They're just writing a cartoon about little girl.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I mean, I guess they could have an episode where she's like, "Oh no, how will I stop this?

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Oh, maybe I need these shoes." And they show her walk into a pay-less shoe store and try not to shoes for 20 minutes.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And then she saves the day. They can't really do anything about that.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And they're getting super, super frustrated. Ashi Productions starts cutting their budget.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And they're like, "Dude, how are you expecting us to draw this cartoon as fast as we can, man?

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 How do you expect us to draw this cartoon? Write this cartoon, produce this cartoon without a budget?"

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And Ashi's like, "Figure it out, man. Sell more toys."

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 The thing is, is that Ashi Productions and really all the studios back then, they knew they needed to get some of that merchandise money as well.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And right now, they're looking at the market and it is dominated. It is dominated by a line of toys associated with a show known as "Common Rider."

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And that's like a live action one about like a bug riding a motorcycle or a guy who turns into a motorcycle bug or something like that.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Anyways, it's like a Power Rangers type thing.

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 So, bug motorcycle man is selling a bunch of toys, selling a bunch of gadgets, selling a bunch of clothes.

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Minky Momo isn't doing this despite its popularity. So, the team behind Minky Momo gets so upset with this.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So upset with the idea that they're not getting paid what they feel they're worth.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 They decide to make episode 45.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And in episode 45, they completely depower Minky Momo.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 She loses all of her powers. So, by the end of that episode, she goes, "I'm just a real girl living with these parents.

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 The show is not going to be the same after this episode. Oh no. Maybe if you'd bought my merchandise, I'd still have magical powers."

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 They basically depowered her. Optimus Prime could no longer turn into a robot from now on. It's just going to be a show about a truck.

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And Ashi Productions is like, "Whatever, we don't care."

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 They're probably not even watching the show at this point.

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Like, this was a revolt among the team saying, "Let's totally shake the game up and then they'll start giving us more money because we can't write a cartoon about magic or girly."

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Ashi Productions, they don't even care. They don't even bat an eye.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I think probably at this point the show is losing them money.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So then the next episode comes out.

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Episode 46.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Now what I don't understand is what-- were these shows like a weekly show?

106
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I know in America when you have a cartoon that comes out every week, they're not spending the week-- the next week trying to draw the new one.

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So I don't know if it was a weekly show in Japan or if it came out when it comes out.

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I don't know what the schedule was like. I really couldn't find anything like that because I have some questions about this urban legend.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 When I say a religion, everything I've told you so far is true.

110
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Maybe-- maybe Common Rider doesn't turn into a bug motorcycle. I'm sure I've probably got some of those details wrong.

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 But you have this story, right? This is all true.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So Episode 45 came out. They depowered her. Ashi Productions doesn't even bat an eye.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They're like, "Okay, now we really gotta figure this out."

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Episode 46.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 It's an infamous episode to this day for multiple reasons.

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Episode 46.

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Miki Momo is playing in the street. She's a real girl at this point.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And a truck full of Common Rider merchandise is barreling down the road.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And she's playing in the street. She's like, "Oh no, fully I had my official Miki Momo eye glasses on."

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 "I'd be able to see what's in front of me."

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The truck hits her and kills her.

122
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Now this isn't like a "Bart is dead" Squidward Suicide type of myth.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 This episode really happened. This episode really aired.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 A truck hits this girl, the star of the show, and kills her.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And people were shocked. Ashi Productions, again, they probably weren't even watching it.

126
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 They're like, "Oh, why-- why-- why all of a sudden we're getting all these angry phone calls?"

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 She gets hit by a truck. Now this show apparently was being broadcast out of the city of Kobe, that area.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And after this episode aired, an earthquake hit the city.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And another earthquake hit Osaka, which apparently was another place where this show was being broadcast from.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Not super devastating. And actually some of the versions of this--

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 'Cause this is where we start getting into the urban legend plan.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Some of the versions say it was an earthquake warning.

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 That "Eeeh, eeeh," like right after that episode aired, there was an earthquake warning.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And then I saw other versions that said, "No."

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Two fairly minor earthquakes hit Kobe and Osaka after this episode aired.

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And the team was like, "We're done. Like, we've-- we've killed off our main character.

137
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We totally shocked everyone. We subverted your expectations."

138
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 But even though they were not performing well for Ashi Productions,

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 they were obligated to make more episodes.

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 They weren't-- they didn't have a contract for just 46 episodes and more episodes on their contract.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So they're like, "Fine. We'll finish out the series."

142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 So episode 47, Miki Momo's just back to life. And she has her powers back.

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So basically it does totally get reset. Now she has her powers back.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 She's flying around. She's solving problems using magic.

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And the show continues on until May 26, 1983.

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 The show was airing original episodes for around a year.

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 People loved the show. They didn't love the merchandise.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 They didn't love the merchandise, but the show was still extremely popular, extremely beloved.

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And the last episode aired on May 26, 1983.

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 On May 26, 1983, there was what's known as the Sea of Japan Earthquake.

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Which was-- I think it was like a 7.0 earthquake. It was pretty high.

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And it caused this huge tsunami.

153
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And 104 people died in this earthquake, most of them due to the tsunami.

154
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And 324 people were injured.

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Japan has a lot of earthquakes. Japan has a ton of earthquakes.

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I don't think that's where the legend started.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 You had apparently either earthquakes or earthquake warnings.

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 There's a big difference between the two, right?

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Earthquakes or earthquake warnings after Miki Momo died.

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The show ends. There's the Sea of Japan earthquake.

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And I don't think this is where the urban legend started.

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 But what happened was, fast forward to the 90s.

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 We're in the 1990s now. Everything's doing a revival.

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Everything that's retro is cool again.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 The show Magical Princess Miki Momo, the original series, is brought back into reruns.

166
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And people are watching the show. They're like, "Oh, dude, I remember this show.

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 This show is part of my childhood. I really enjoy it."

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I was kind of bummed out in episode 46, but I know everything will be okay.

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And the show's running as normal. We get to episode 45.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 She loses her powers.

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Episode 46, she gets hit by a truck.

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And then the show just continues until the final episode is aired on January 17, 1995.

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 January 17, 1995 was the Kobe earthquake.

174
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 This earthquake was far more devastating.

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 6434 deaths.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 43,000 people injured.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And this is what gave rise to the story of Miki Momo, the curse of Miki Momo.

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And in between those two runs of the shows, I have some questions about the urban legend,

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 but as I was digging into this, I found other branches off of this.

180
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 In between the runs of the original show and the show in the 1990s,

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 because I was like, "If this was so popular, you can't tell me they never rerun it

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 in the middle of the early 80s to the early 90s."

183
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Apparently they did run it at some point in the 80s, and there was another quake, but it was minor.

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 That's the thing with urban legends, sometimes you'll get rid of the details that don't really match.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So we have stuff like that.

186
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 But here's the thing, when you think about this urban legend, you imagine like the episode ends,

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and then there's an earthquake.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But these earthquakes were real. The show was real.

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 My question is like the Kobe earthquake, it's a great urban legend, right?

190
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It cursed the media, I love that stuff.

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The Kobe earthquake happened just before 6 a.m. in the morning,

192
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and the first earthquake, the 1983 earthquake, happened before noon.

193
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So when was the show being aired?

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 The dates may line up to the finale, but was the original ending back in 1983, was it aired before noon?

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Because if it wasn't, if the show was being aired in the afternoon,

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 original run episodes in the afternoon, then it would have happened after the earthquake.

197
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 The same thing with the reruns, I can imagine being run early in the morning, right?

198
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Because they're reruns.

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So maybe they did air before 6 a.m.

200
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But what's interesting is you see this urban legend, you can kind of poke at it like that.

201
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But there's even other parts of the urban legend.

202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 There's an interview that I saw on this Japanese talk show, and they were talking about urban legends.

203
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And apparently it's not just the earthquakes.

204
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 This role was considered cursed.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 In between the series, the original run and the reruns, there was a couple movies.

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 There was a couple anime movies about Princess Miki Momo,

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 and it got to the point where actresses considered the role bad luck.

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Because there was three actresses that have played this role over time.

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 One of them had a terrible love life, like just had a life full of divorce and heartbreak.

210
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 One of them lost their hearing, and one of them got leukemia, which I imagine would be the worst of the three.

211
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I would take the first two combined than having leukemia.

212
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So the curse isn't just about the earthquakes.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The idea is that this show, the character itself is cursed.

214
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And before you take on the role of Miki Momo, you should think long and hard about is there a curse connected to this?

215
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I know I've been talking about this a long time, but I really wanted to set it up or wrap it up right now.

216
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 The idea, the belief behind this urban legend is this.

217
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 By killing off the character, it sent like a psychic shockwave through all the fans.

218
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Nobody expected that.

219
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And then they got her back.

220
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But you still had that initial psychic scar, right?

221
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 This was not supposed to be a show that dealt with such a topic.

222
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Now they said because the show dealt with heavy topics, it allowed future magical princess girl shows and future children's anime to kind of address darker themes.

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This is one of the shows that did that.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 But when the show ended, it reignited that psychic scar and it caused these earthquakes.

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And people loved the show so much, they couldn't be without it.

226
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So an interesting urban legend, I like the idea of the actor.

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Not saying that I want actresses to be cursed, but that's another layer to it.

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Is there something behind it?

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Because you imagine when the writers and the producers of this show were making it, they were so frustrated.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 They were pouring all of their frustrations and anger into the art, into this hand-drawn art.

231
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And they were getting ripped off.

232
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 They had one of the most popular shows on at the time.

233
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 It's iconic at this point.

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 They weren't getting paid.

235
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 It wasn't like they weren't getting paid what they were worth.

236
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 They literally were getting less money than they were promised.

237
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Their budget was getting slashed.

238
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And you can just imagine all of these artists cranking out cell after cell after cell after cell of this cartoon.

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They're hand-drawing each frame and each frame they're working their hardest and all that frustration and anger and hate towards their bosses pouring into each drawing.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And then you play those drawings at 32 frames per second.

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It's like casting a spell of anger and rage.

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Fascinating, fascinating urban legend.

243
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Parts of it are true.

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Is the cartoon responsible for those events?

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Who knows?

246
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But all the behind-the-scenes stuff was.

247
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So those guys were definitely pouring a lot of psychic...

248
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 If not the fans, the artists themselves were pouring a lot of psychic energy into each drawing.

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And that coupled with the fans, that coupled with the audience pouring their own psychic energy into the cartoon, nuts.

250
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It definitely could be cursed media.

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Apparently they haven't re-ran it since.

252
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 They're like, "You can get them on DVD, folks!"

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 "You can buy this giant box of VHS cassettes."

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 They don't air this cartoon anymore in Japan, apparently.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Very, very fascinating and if true creepy story.

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Lunaris, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

257
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 We are leaving behind Japan.

258
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 We're headed all the way out to a hospital.

259
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 The other day on the export, there's been some really good stuff on the export recently.

260
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 There's been a lot of cool stuff on the export over the years, but...

261
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Someone asked the question, "Did you ever live in a haunted house?"

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 What happened?

263
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And then you had a couple people posting about times they were in haunted houses.

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But the one that really stood out out of that entire thread, the one that really stood out to me,

265
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 was an anonymous person.

266
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 We're gonna go ahead and call this person Sam.

267
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Their time that they spent in a haunted hospital.

268
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And actually, to be fair, not even a haunted hospital.

269
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Let's get into this. Let's go ahead and get started with this.

270
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 This is a really cool one.

271
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We don't have a location though, right? Everything's anonymous here.

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 We don't have a location. We don't have a time.

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I think, from based on a couple key details, he says he's a war veteran.

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I'm gonna assume the Iraq war, right? The second one.

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So I think this story probably takes place at the very earliest mid-2000s, right?

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 2008 maybe forward. I think it would be a time.

277
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And we have no idea where this, other than the fact that he's an American veteran,

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 the story probably takes place somewhere in America.

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So we have Sam.

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And after his service is done, he gets a job at a local hospital.

281
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And part of his duty was working in the morgue.

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So even though he's a security officer, he also...

283
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And this is something you probably do because of your security guard at a hospital,

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 you're gonna be sitting around a lot, right?

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So, hey man, you wanna help us out down here?

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And he just becomes part of the morgue team where he will check bodies in.

287
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And he said, you know, I'd seen a bunch of horrible stuff over during the war.

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 You get people after car accidents and stuff like that.

289
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Sure, it's kinda gross, but I can handle it.

290
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I've seen worse. I can handle this stuff.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So a lot of times he would come in, he would check in bodies and be down there.

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And he says the way that their morgue was set up was basically one large room

293
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 that had all of these gurneys and the bodies were in bags.

294
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 The bodies were in body bags.

295
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Most of the time, you know, car accident, homicide victim, people falling off of cliffs and stuff like that.

296
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 He would stick the body in the bag and they'd be there for a couple days

297
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 until the loved ones or the family, they'll make arrangements to take the body

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 to have it cremated or to have the funeral done or something like that.

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So most of the bodies weren't there that long, but some were, right?

300
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So you can identify the family to even get the body picked up.

301
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 If the body's sitting there for a while, if there was no family and was no friends, you're just in that bag.

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 What happens then is that the city takes care of it.

303
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 They actually have the body removed and it's sent to a crematory usually,

304
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 and it's cremated and then just put in a potter's field maybe,

305
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 or maybe have the ashes scattered and things like that.

306
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So that's kinda the setup for this story,

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 because sometimes bodies would be there for a while because shocker, bureaucracy is slow

308
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 and it sucks a lot of the time.

309
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So they would have a body show up and the paperwork wouldn't get processed in time

310
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 or someone's just not doing their job on the city level

311
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 and the body would just sit there for days and weeks and maybe like a month or two

312
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 until finally all the paperwork is finally processed and they take the body out.

313
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 So that's the setup.

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So we're sitting in this morgue with Sam and this body comes in

315
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and this body is of an unidentified homeless man.

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 He's wheeled into the morgue and they're checking him in

317
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 and what they are told is that this homeless man was found,

318
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 burned alive underneath an overpass,

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 scorched from head to toe and he was burned so badly

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 that even the other hobos in the area couldn't identify him.

321
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And the police said they couldn't identify him either because he had no teeth.

322
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 All of his teeth apparently had rotted out over the years

323
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 so they couldn't do any sort of dental ID.

324
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 This body was 100% unidentifiable.

325
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So it's gonna sit in the morgue for a while until the city gets its act together

326
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 and processes all this paperwork.

327
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And Sam goes, I'll say this, it wasn't the most pleasant smell.

328
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 It wasn't the most pleasant smell once he entered the morgue.

329
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I've heard this before too, there's a very distinct smell when human flesh burns.

330
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And people in wartime often smell that smell, right?

331
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So he goes, yeah, it had like a sweet smell.

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Not like he enjoyed it, not like he's like yummy, yummy, yummy.

333
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Who brought the jelly ranchers, it just kind of had like a sweet, sickly smell

334
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 because it's not a fresh burn.

335
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 The police didn't bring him in there when he was still on fire, they're spraying it with a fire extinguisher.

336
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 He's still like all smoky, they're like, here you go guys.

337
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 The fire was put out and all that stuff.

338
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He's brought in, he's in a body bag, but the smell would still permeate the bag.

339
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And Sam goes, a lot of people complained about the smell, it was a little gross,

340
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 but you know, you just get used to it.

341
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And I honestly, it smelled worse.

342
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I had been in way worse situations than a smoky, smoldering bum sitting in my workspace.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But one night Sam was alone in the morgue, which would happen a lot.

344
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He was alone in the morgue and he's filling out paperwork.

345
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And at this point, the burned up bum had been there for a while.

346
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It was already like a week or two had passed, or even more.

347
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Sam's filling out paperwork and all of a sudden,

348
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 what the, what is, what?

349
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 He smells burning flesh.

350
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Not burnt flesh.

351
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 He smells actively burning flesh.

352
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Something's on fire.

353
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And he jumps up and he is like, there's a fire somewhere in here.

354
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Like, I don't know how it's possible.

355
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I'm looking around, I'm not seeing fire, I'm not seeing smoke, but something is burning.

356
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And he's looking around and he can't figure out where the smell's coming from.

357
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And as he starts walking towards the burnt up homeless man's body, the smell gets stronger.

358
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 So at this point, you would have to assume maybe there's a fire in the body bag.

359
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 He doesn't see any smoke, but as he's walking towards his body, the smell gets stronger and stronger.

360
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And the temperature goes higher and higher.

361
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 As he's walking towards his body, he feels the temperature of the air actually get hot.

362
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It gets so hot, in fact, that he feels if he keeps walking towards this body, he's gonna catch on fire.

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 He goes, the heat was so intense, I actually couldn't even get close to the body.

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 The smell had completely filled his nostrils.

365
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 The heat is burning every centimeter of his skin.

366
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 He goes back, he calls the fire department.

367
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He calls a code red.

368
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He lets people know that there's a fire in the building.

369
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Fire department shows up, no fire.

370
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 The heat had disappeared.

371
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 The smell had disappeared.

372
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Now he's just sitting in this morgue with fire running with hoses.

373
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They're just blasting all the bodies.

374
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 They're like, there's no fire.

375
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 As they're walking in, I doubt they could smell anything, right?

376
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And Sam's like, listen, I, okay, like, you know, you would feel embarrassed about this.

377
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 You call the fire department, they come down there and you're just kind of sitting there in a morgue.

378
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 In a morgue that's like 62 degrees or colder.

379
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And his boss, Sam's boss is like, maybe, maybe like this job is just kind of getting to you.

380
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not getting to me.

381
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I'm totally fine, but I'm pretty sure I smelled something on fire.

382
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And the boss is like, well, maybe you just need to get some sleep.

383
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 But before you go home and get some sleep, you got a shift to finish young man.

384
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So they all leave the fire department leaves, the boss leaves and Sam is at this point thing.

385
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And yeah, I probably was just imagining something, but that's not like me.

386
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I'm not, I'm not someone who hallucinates the smell of burning flesh.

387
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He's sitting there and things go back to normal.

388
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Later that night, another body is wheeled into the morgue.

389
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's someone who had just died in a car accident that night.

390
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Sam's sitting there and he's filling out his paper or...

391
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

392
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 The smell's back.

393
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 The heat is back.

394
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But this time it's not focused on the body.

395
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's emanating throughout the room.

396
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He said it felt like waves of heated air just hit him over and over and over.

397
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And over and he's trying to finish his waiver work, right?

398
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 He doesn't want to just leave this, this is part of his job.

399
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He is a veteran.

400
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 He's not gonna get scared away by a smell and the temperature rise, right?

401
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 What are you gonna do?

402
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 He's filling out his paperwork as quick as he can and then he hears it.

403
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It's faint at first.

404
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 It takes him a second to realize what the sound is.

405
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 'Cause it's so faint when it starts.

406
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 But as it gets louder, as it becomes deafening,

407
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 he realizes it's the sound of a man screaming.

408
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Okay, I don't mean to finish this in favor of work, I'm out!

409
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And he jumps up and he begins to run for the door.

410
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 The screaming, the heat, the smell, he says this is what I imagine hell is like.

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 That's the exact impression he gets from this combination.

412
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And as he gets to the door, he feels something grab onto him

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 and he turns around and standing right behind him, just inches from him.

414
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Is flame in the shape of a human?

415
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 But all he can focus on is this burning man's face.

416
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 He said, "Just inches from me, I just see this man, his mouth open wide."

417
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Screaming, screaming into my face, screaming in pain, screaming in terror.

418
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 He's looking at me and it's not that he wants to hurt me.

419
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 He's grabbing me, he's holding me, he's screaming for my help.

420
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 He's screaming for me to rescue him.

421
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 But what can I do?

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 What can I do?

423
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 He broke free from the grasp of this specter, this revenant, and he ran out of the morgue.

424
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 When he told his boss about this, his boss was like, "Okay, probably should have sent you home after the first time."

425
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "But you're going home tonight and I'm not going to have you working in the morgue for a while."

426
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I don't think Sam was like, "What? No, come on man, give me one more chance."

427
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 He was kind of glad for that.

428
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 He was kind of glad for that.

429
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 He goes, "I didn't work in that morgue again until finally, it was like a month later."

430
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 The city finally got all their paperwork processed and they had the burnt up homeless man removed

431
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 so his body could either be buried somewhere or most likely and most horrifyingly in this circumstance, cremated,

432
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 and his ashes scattered.

433
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Sam then started to work in the morgue again and he goes, "Even though I worked in the morgue after this man was removed,

434
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 every time I went in there, my nostrils were still filled with the smell of burning flesh."

435
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Very, very interesting story, interesting ghost story.

436
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I have to put this caveat out there, right?

437
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 This was posted anonymously online.

438
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Is it true?

439
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We don't know.

440
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 The question is, is the story real in any way, shape, or form, or did someone just type a spooky ghost story

441
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 and insert it in an area where we were talking about real ghost stories?

442
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 It's always a possibility, right?

443
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 If someone's having a good chuckle about this, "Aha, he fell for it."

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 It sucks, right?

445
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 I don't like to tell stuff that's knowingly false on this show.

446
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But that could be anything, right?

447
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 We read books and articles that could 100% be false when we're talking about world paranormal.

448
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 But I wanted to wrap this story up like this.

449
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 It's a typical ghost story.

450
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's creepy.

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 We have all of the scents and the smells and the sensations of a man's death coming back.

452
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Not just the ghost itself, but the circumstances of the death coming back.

453
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Very, very interesting story.

454
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 But I wanted to take this back to another place.

455
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 We don't know how he caught on fire in the first place.

456
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 The other homeless people underneath the overpass saw that he was burning alive,

457
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 but they don't know what caused it.

458
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 If it was like an accident, he accidentally set his clothes on fire, spontaneous human combustion.

459
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 They don't really know, and so the police didn't know if it was a homicide or an accidental death.

460
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 They just wheeled him in, and since they couldn't identify him and they couldn't figure out what killed him,

461
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 that's just kind of the end of the investigation.

462
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 But as I was reading this story and the fact that he comes back as a figure made of flames,

463
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I thought, let's put our conspiracy caps on to wrap up this episode,

464
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 how many homeless people do you think sell their souls to the devil?

465
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I mean, it's kind of, what's the opposite of a rhetorical question?

466
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Rhetorical question is something we both already know the answer to.

467
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 What's the opposite of that?

468
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Because this is a question that I don't know if there's an answer if anyone has this answer.

469
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And we can look at it both ways.

470
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 One, we can have the idea, when you're homeless, when you're homeless and living under an overpass,

471
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 what do you have to lose?

472
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 I mean, obviously you're immortal soul, but you're not thinking about that.

473
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 What do you have to lose?

474
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I'm not saying this is right now, there's some bum listening to this podcast underneath the bridge.

475
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He's like, you're right, Jason, maybe I should sell my soul.

476
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 But my point is, is that, like, at that point when you're living under an overpass,

477
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 you have to be thinking this can't get any worse.

478
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And if you sold your soul to the devil,

479
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 you could not sound like I'm running a recruitment ad, but you could get money.

480
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You could get out of your situation.

481
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Now selling your soul to the devil isn't as simple as saying,

482
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 "Selling my soul to the devil."

483
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 There's rituals and all sorts of things.

484
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And even then, that's a little eyebrow raising how common this actually can be.

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 But, I mean, why not?

486
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 I feel like I'm running a recruitment ad, but why not even dry?

487
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 If you're that homeless, you've been homeless for years.

488
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 I'm not saying you got evicted from your apartment tomorrow.

489
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 You're like, "Une, it looks like one of us got to sell our soul to the devil."

490
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 When you're living under an overpass, when you're homeless, all your teeth are gone.

491
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Right? What do you have to lose?

492
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So I was thinking, what if this guy sold his soul to the devil,

493
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 and he caught on fire, right?

494
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 The reason why, I'm not saying that every homeless person who dies,

495
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 they die from their soldiers sold to the devil, young man.

496
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 It's because the way he came back, when he's on fire and he's walking around the morgue,

497
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 the heat emanating off of him, and the fact that Sam felt like they were in hell,

498
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 makes me think like his soul was still burning type of thing.

499
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 But then I thought, so we have that, because why wouldn't a homeless person want to sell their soul to the devil?

500
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 But then I thought, and we'll wrap it up like this,

501
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 what if, that's always a key word in the world of the paranormal, right?

502
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 What if he wasn't homeless and sold his soul to the devil?

503
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 What if this was the end result of him selling his soul to the devil?

504
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 That's always the key, right?

505
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 I mean, sure, it does sound like it came right out of a Wishmaster movie,

506
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 but even going back to like the Faustian bargain, it's the idea that your wishes go sideways.

507
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 So if a man sold his soul to the devil, maybe he wasn't a homeless man selling his soul to the devil,

508
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 maybe he had sold his soul to the devil decades prior.

509
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And through that bargain going sideways, he's like, "Man, I wish I could sit at home

510
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 and just kick my feet up on the couch all day long."

511
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And Satan's like, "Done!"

512
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And you're like, "Wait, what? I wasn't trying to sell my soul.

513
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And then what's the ultimate freedom in life other than to be a hobo?"

514
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And this what he made his wish for glory and riches, and he got those at some point,

515
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 because we don't know who this guy was, right?

516
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 It could be Kenny Loggins for all we know, and the one you see today is a clone.

517
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 You have this person make this deal with the devil, and the devil always wins, right?

518
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Your life just decays in front of you. You got what you wanted,

519
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 but that wasn't what you needed, and your life decays in front of you,

520
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 and then you're underneath that overpass, and you have to imagine every day, every night,

521
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 this man was worrying that the price for that bargain would come due.

522
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 And he made a deal with the devil, and each day that passes,

523
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 it's getting closer and closer to the time that the devil will return and take what is his.

524
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 And on this night, the devil showed up and burned the man alive.

525
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And that's why his soul is burning in agony.

526
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Now, obviously, the most likely scenario either is that the story's fake,

527
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 or the most likely scenario is that accident, right?

528
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 This guy accidentally burned himself alive.

529
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 But it's just, I loved it as a ghost story, and then I just started thinking,

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 I wonder how much of the homeless community

531
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 traffics in Black magic, traffics and the stuff, because what do you have to lose, really?

532
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 What do you have to lose at this point?

533
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So, do homeless people worship the devil?

534
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 I guess it's kind of what I'm saying, or are people homeless because they worship the devil?

535
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 You're like, "Jace, both of those statements are super insensitive."

536
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 I'm not saying that every homeless person you see sold their soul to the devil.

537
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 I'm just saying maybe some of them.

538
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Just an interesting conspiracy theory.

539
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 I wonder what the Venn diagram is.

540
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I'm sure it's very small, if it exists at all, but homeless people,

541
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 and people who sold their soul to the devil,

542
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 and I'm gonna be saying it out loud in my head, I was like,

543
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 "Oh dude, this will be totally weird, man. It'll be creepy."

544
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 But I wonder if you do have a crossover between...

545
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Because if I was the devil dude, I'd totally be hanging out underneath Overpass.

546
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 It sounds like this grand castle in hell, boring!

547
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 I'm gonna hang out under the Overpass, down in Florida, and get me some souls.

548
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I can totally see, you got nothing to lose, right?

549
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 I gotta stop saying that because I'm so afraid people are like,

550
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 "You know Jason's really cool show, but he's really, really trying to get homeless people to sell their souls to the devil."

551
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 It's a creepy story nonetheless, and I think it opened up a new creepy conspiracy theory for me.

552
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Like, does the devil prey on the homeless?

553
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Does the devil... We know he preys on the weak, right?

554
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 We know he preys on people who are either weak of heart, or weak of mind.

555
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And that could be someone who's selling their soul to become rich and famous.

556
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 It could also be someone who's selling their soul just to be like,

557
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 "I want to eat tomorrow. I haven't eaten in like two weeks."

558
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 I'd sell my soul for a ham sandwich, and the devil shows up.

559
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I don't know, I don't know, it does sound a little bit ridiculous.

560
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 It does, but what a creepy story, and I'll tell you this, man, I really enjoyed that horror story.

561
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 I hope it's true, right?

562
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 We don't know though.

563
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 We don't know, but I did really enjoy it.

564
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 I really did enjoy the story about that bumby and burned alive!

565
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 It's a horrible story, but it's a ghost story, it's really cool.

566
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 And yeah, new conspiracy theories are homeless people actually making deals with the devil.

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Maybe, that's the answer to that conspiracy theory.

568
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Maybe, it might be, and that's spooky, right?

569
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 You're like walking down the street and some guy's like,

570
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 "Yo, can I have some change?"

571
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And you're like, "No, no, I don't have any change on me."

572
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 And then you hear, "You hear hellhounds coming up behind you?

573
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 You're running away from invisible dogs of wrath."

574
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Who knows?

575
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 That last part's made up right there, that last part's never happened,

576
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 it would be creepy if it did.
