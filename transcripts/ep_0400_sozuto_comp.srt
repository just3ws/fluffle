1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
 Previously on Dead Rabbit Radio. Yeah, big huge crowd. Yeah, yeah, Jason, Jason, Jason.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,960
 A bunch of people, a bunch of people yelling and then me at a podium standing there going,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,520
 "People, people of America, you have a choice today. We could have another four years of

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:51,520
 President Jeb Bush boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo

00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:08,520
 bringing a gun to the speech day, bad planning on my part. Guys walking through, everyone has guns, but this guy looks particularly weird. And then it cuts to, we're looking through the scope and I'm running for president. If you haven't got the gimmick yet, I'm running for president in an alternate universe."

6
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 And then get shot, bloods shooting out of my body. Look over at my wife, Britney Spears. You were supposed to be First Lady, but you'll always be First Lady to me. And then flying through the quantum realm.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:57,520
 And then I'm sitting in an apartment, a messy apartment. What? Oh man, I was just about to run for president and I was going to beat President Jeb Bush. But here I am doing episode 400 of Dead Rabbit Radio, which I have to say is probably a lot more fun than trying to run the United States amidst a horrible, possibly horrible virus going on.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:10,520
 And now this episode, that was previously on Dead Rabbit. So the gimmick, you get it. This episode of Dead Rabbit Radio is I battle the coronavirus myself. I brought it from the alternate universe.

9
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:31,520
 And that's actually intro. Before I go to, gosh, just started the episode, but it is interesting. What if the diseases like this virus are actually brought, you know, like Europeans showed up and like was spreading diseases everywhere? What if coronavirus is from a time traveler?

10
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 Let's go ahead and actually do the intro here. That is non-related. Okay, here we go. Here's the intro. It's the 400th episode. I'm allowed to break the limit a bit.

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:03:07,520
 A cryptid in Argentina that may be the most unusual one we've ever discussed. And then we travel to La Crosse, Wisconsin to investigate a horrific crime. Was this crime committed by a man-man or was it committed by a demon who lives in the mirror? Today on the 400th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 400th episode, season nine. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? I mean, I believe it. I visualize this all along, but at the same time when you get here, you're like 400 episodes.

14
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 This is awesome. Thank you guys so much for being on this ride. I know I totally love that intro. I think that might be the longest intro I've ever had. But yeah, we can start that as a new conspiracy theory.

15
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 What if diseases we don't have cures for actually brought from time travelers or people from other dimensions? I wonder, that might be an up and coming conspiracy theory. Make a new iceberg. Put that on it.

16
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:11,520
 Coronavirus was brought to us by a time traveler or someone from another dimension. Now, speaking of someone from another dimension, I don't know, he could actually live here. I want to say thanks to our newest Patreon, Gun of Liberty 00.

17
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:19,520
 Thank you very much, Gun, for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot. I love it when you guys do this. And if you can't support the Patreon, you can always get the word out about the show.

18
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 We got flyers@deadrabbit.com. You can print out. Pass those out. Just spread the word. Really, really helps a lot. Everything helps out a lot.

19
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 So, I really appreciate that. Now, first off, we are going to Argentina. So, let's give Gun of Liberty 00 the keys to the Carpenter copter. You're going to fly us out to Argentina. So, why Argentina?

20
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:53,520
 Normally, there's not a why. Normally, I'm just fine. I'm not always like, why Russia? Normally, we just go out to where the stories are. But if you follow me on Twitter at @deadrabbitradio on Twitter, you'll already know this.

21
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 This show is huge in Argentina. It's weird. Now, I said, oh, I always visualized my going 400, 600, 800 episodes. I never thought the show would be worldwide.

22
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:16,520
 Right? I figured it would have a pretty dedicated audience in the United States, maybe a little bit in Europe. But the show is 60% of it's United States. We got a huge fan base across the world.

23
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 Argentina is one of the fastest countries for podcast, just overall podcast growths. And Dead Rabbit Radio in our category, which is a pretty general category. It's called personal journals.

24
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 So, this American Life Ted Talks Logan Paul's podcast is in this. Dead Rabbit Radio for one day was number one in Argentina in our category. And you go, okay, anyone can be number one. Fluke, we're in the top 20.

25
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:55,520
 We've been in the top 20 for the past three, four weeks in Argentina. So, that's huge. We're beating Logan Paul in Argentina. We're beating Ted Talk in Argentina.

26
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:12,520
 And when I look at the other podcasts in Argentina, most of them are Spanish, which is what would be assumed, right? But this dude in the US talking about, what do I talk about? Monsters and like debunking UFOs or believing in UFOs depends on the story.

27
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:24,520
 Sometimes I totally believe it. And the other times, I'm like, that's the dumbest story I've ever heard, is beating out Logan Paul. Now, I don't have a problem personally with Logan Paul. That's not going to be on my gravestone that I beat Logan Paul at something.

28
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 But I just find it very, very interesting. So, what I wanted to do is I wanted to thank my fans in Argentina who really have consistently kept this show in the top 20. So, gun, fly us out to Argentina.

29
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:58,520
 And I'm thinking, do we've done so many stories in South America, so many cryptids and legends and all sorts of stuff. So, when I started researching cryptids in Argentina, I learned a very valuable lesson.

30
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:12,520
 Not every country has dope cryptids. So, let's just be real. You know how they say Eskimos have 30 different words for snow? I don't know if that's true, but people say that.

31
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:22,520
 Argentina has 30 different words for a giant sloth. Right now, there's a bunch of people in Argentina laughing at that joke. Everyone else is like, what?

32
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 I found a website that was all of the Argentinian cryptids. They're all just giant sloths. It would be like this giant creature walking through the woods, attacked three chickens and a farmer ran it off with a broom or something.

33
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:50,520
 And then it would be like, people believe it was a giant sloth. I'm like, oh, that's kind of lame. And then it would be like, in this other region near the foot of the Andes Mountains, there's a giant 8 foot tall creature that was beating up a donkey one day.

34
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 And then a farmer came out and shot a gun up in the air and ran away. And then it would be like, people believe this is a giant sloth. It's all giant sloths down there. Which you're going chasing.

35
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:15,520
 Giant sloths are extinct. That's a cryptid, right? Why are you making them a giant sloth? Here's the thing. Yes, yes, you're right. If a creature is not recognized by science or was supposed to be extinct, that is the definition of a cryptid.

36
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:33,520
 But then there's another definition of a cryptid, which is the mainstream definition of a cryptid, which is a monster, right? Like, if there's a...it should be able to get you. And there's nothing less threatening than a sloth chasing you.

37
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:48,520
 And like, what do you...you're like, oh no, I just have to simply stand for...you just walk slowly, walk around a fence. It's all giant sloths. It's so many giant sloths down there.

38
00:08:48,520 --> 00:09:01,520
 Now, and then I started to think, maybe that's why they like this podcast so much. Because they're like, whoa, other parts of the world have like UFO sightings and these big old monsters running around. You got skin walkers walking around Oregon.

39
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:16,520
 This sounds awesome! And here I am in Argentina and the scariest movie I saw recently was like Attack of Sloths, which actually, I just looked out my window and just saw a bunch of things. I think there's just regular sloths down there too, so that's even less interesting.

40
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:30,520
 Like, Bigfoot's not interesting in the jungle because there's a real gorilla's walking around. Bigfoot's interesting in places where there are no gorillas. If there's regular sloths in Argentina, who cares if there's a giant sloth down there?

41
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:43,520
 But anyways, let's look at some of their other ones. So we're not going to trash Argentina all day long, but you got...I don't know if it's like a cultural thing. Well, actually I do have a suspicion, but let me go on with this. Here's some other things they have.

42
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:56,520
 They have this thing called the Ucamar, it's a giant bear that runs around. Some people do think that that's actually a giant sloth, but the Ucamar is a massive bear or sloth, depending on the researcher.

43
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:06,520
 There's the Jui Jui, it's a plant, it's a cryptid plant. I actually had an episode, I don't know if I ever recorded it, honestly, about plant man-eating plants that I record that one.

44
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:16,520
 Anyways, I probably don't remember it because it was boring. Like, the idea of getting eaten by a plant is pretty interesting, but not really.

45
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:26,520
 I mean, I guess I've had my choice between being digested by a plant or being killed by a giant sloth. I would take the plant just because, you know, that would be a more novel way to die.

46
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,520
 But, again, they're both super slow. I'm like, "Oh no, this plant!" And you just walk a few feet away and it's like, "Oh..."

47
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:41,520
 The Jui Jui apparently shoots out pollen. Makes you fall asleep-which is-that's not a superpower. All plants do that, but makes you fall asleep and then it sucks your blood out.

48
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 There was this thing called the Phantasma-Delos-Riscos, which means, if it's pronounced correctly, means the ghost of the badlands.

49
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:58,520
 You're like, "Oh, that sounds dope!" I found two references to it, they both said the exact same thing. It's a naked man who just yells all the time.

50
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:08,520
 It's not a cryptid if it's happening right now in Oakland, California. It's not a cryptid if there's thousands of naked men as you're listening to this walking around yelling,

51
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,520
 possibly one within-like, you might be able to hear them, depending how close you are to a major metropolitan city.

52
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:25,520
 There's aren't cryptids. They're called homeless people. Now, maybe if there was another element, like, not only did he-not only was he naked and did he yell a lot, but he like, flew around,

53
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,520
 then yeah, sure, that's impressive, but just a naked guy walking through the middle of nowhere yelling? What?

54
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:40,520
 Anyways, all of that leads up to this, and let me go back. So the thing that I noticed with all of these cryptids in Argentina, which this was an interesting note,

55
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 they're all believable. Like, Bigfoot, sure, the idea that there's a giant, like, missing link or ape monster walking around, America, or, you know, the Himalayas or something like that,

56
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 that in itself is interesting, but the idea that it can bury its dead, or maybe it turns invisible, or it has all these special-that's ridiculous.

57
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 Mothman, fanciful, Mellonheads or fanciful, Pomeros or fanciful, all these other cryptids and spirits and stuff like that, they cross the border between a mythological,

58
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 they have some sort of magical power, or they're just like a monkey, just like a big old monkey man walking around.

59
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:28,520
 The thing about Argentina is that all of their cryptids are believable. They're all, except, even the plant, I guess, could conceivably have something to it,

60
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 but there's nothing the equivalent of a mothman, at least that I saw of, like, a mothman-type creature or an mbunche, which I believe that was in Chile.

61
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 All of them are like, this bear is supposed to be extinct, it's still walking around, this giant sloth is supposed to be extinct, it's still walking around,

62
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 and, like, this wolf, this weird-looking wolf, should be extinct, it's still walking around, all of their cryptids are scientifically plausible,

63
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 and that's where we get to this cryptid that I did want to highlight, which is something I've never seen before in all of my years of researching this.

64
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 So, fire back up that Carpentercopter gun, we're headed off to Germany, now we're coming back to Argentina, but let's go all the way up to Germany,

65
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
 the year is 1992 and we're going to meet this dude, his name is Michael Skrodal.

66
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,520
 I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that name, because if I'm not, he should have changed it, right?

67
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 Will you be Mrs. Skrodal? I love you, but I'm not going to be that name.

68
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 Anyways, Mr. Skrodal, Michael Skrodal, he's the curator, tell me if this isn't a job that you're going to bag a bunch of chicks doing.

69
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,520
 He's the curator, not like that, not like every job he should have is with the intent of getting a girlfriend.

70
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 However, if your last name is Skrodal, you need all the help you can get. He really should have been like an ultimate fighting championship warrior or whatever.

71
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 The American gladiator, except he was in Germany. Something, rather than this, he was the curator of the Molask collection,

72
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 so he was in charge of all of the snails at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich, Germany.

73
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 Imagine bringing a girl to that workplace. She was like, "Oh, no, no, no, I don't collect snails. I'm in charge of the people who collect snails."

74
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,520
 She's like, "It's still gross." He's like, "Escargot, madame." No, this is going to use eating exhibits.

75
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 This is a fossilized snail. This snail is 65 million years old, swallowing it up.

76
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,520
 Do you know they sell Escargot at Walmart? Have you ever gone into the oyster aisle?

77
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 There's other stuff there. There's tuna, cans of tuna, and then there's oysters, and then they sell Escargot.

78
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,520
 It's so bizarre. It's a set. You get a giant go through. You can tell I'm easily distracted this episode.

79
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 This is going to be episode 400, the easily distracted one. I drink a bunch of coffee.

80
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,520
 I actually went for a really long walk. Today's been a great day. I'm so glad that we're starting episode 400.

81
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,520
 I had a great week off, great day, and again, I really, really appreciate you guys enjoying the show.

82
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:02,520
 Anyways, let's get back to this other side segment. There's a jar full of empty snail shells, and then there's a can underneath it.

83
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,520
 You open it up, and there's a bunch of snails in it, and you put them... gross, dude.

84
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,520
 Anyways, you can buy Escargot at Walmart. Why do you want to? I don't know.

85
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,520
 I eat gas station sushi before I eat Escargot from Walmart, but what was I talking about?

86
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 Oh, yeah, this dude. So he's the curator of the Mollusk collection.

87
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 Hey, baby, my name is Mr. Skrotel, would you like to come and look at my snails?

88
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 I'm sure the guy is totally awesome. Honestly, I shouldn't be bagging on him. I'm sure he's an awesome dude, but I don't know.

89
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 Maybe he's a jerk. So anyways, he's in charge of this group.

90
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 Probably single man, young single man. He's attending a lecture of something called the Salanella Solve.

91
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,520
 Salanella Solve. And what it is, he's at this lecture and with a bunch of other nerds, and there's a slideshow,

92
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 and they're like, "We have this record that this dude named Johann's Frenzel, also this German dude, back in 1892, got sent a salt sample from a buddy in Argentina."

93
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 And everyone's like, "Ooh, it's so fascinating. My life is totally devoid of all meaning that I find that fascinating."

94
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 And they start showing these slides and he goes, "Johan is a very well-respected scientist."

95
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:26,520
 He had all these drawings and he goes, "Underneath the microscope, he discovered these little creatures, and it's a single..."

96
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,520
 It's like a little tiny microscopic dude, right? It's like a little amoeba. What's your picture in amoeba?

97
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,520
 But it has a mouth and a butthole. Everyone's like, "What? What in the world?" Everyone's gossiping amongst each other.

98
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,520
 Because this was new. We've seen single cell creatures, and we've seen more complex creatures.

99
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:54,520
 But looking at one that's in between, the missing link between single cell amoebas and more complex dudes with digestion systems,

100
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:01,520
 people were like, "Whoa, this is groundbreaking." Now in 1892, he published these drawings and people were like, "Oh, it's kind of cool."

101
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
 But as time--you would figure you were going to find these all over the place.

102
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 I guess dinosaurs weren't discovered until like the mid-1800s. It's weird to think.

103
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 Up until like 1850, nobody even conceived of a dinosaur, and now there's such a part of pop culture and modern science and stuff like that.

104
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 But anyways, anyways, so they figured, "Ah, there's probably just a bunch of these dudes. So, Johan, whatever, you've got these drawings."

105
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
 But in the year 1992, they had never seen anything like that since.

106
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,520
 So Michael goes, "Let's go--we got to look at these things for ourselves. We got to find some of the salt."

107
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 So they go out to Argentina to go to the Salt Flat where he gets these dudes.

108
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,520
 Him and a bunch of guys go out to the road trip out to Argentina, and there's no more salt field there, where this stuff came from.

109
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 It's cattle grazing land. They're like, "What?"

110
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,520
 And then they go, "If this is real." Because again, they--at one hand, people are thinking, "This is made up."

111
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,520
 Like, if this was actually found, it would have been huge news back then.

112
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 But then other people are going, "Why would he fake it? Like, this is a well-respected guy."

113
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 He reported it. He continued his career. It wasn't like he was walking around talking about Bigfoot, but an amoeba Bigfoot.

114
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,520
 But technically, that's what this was. It was a cryptid. It was a microscopic missing link.

115
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 But Michael goes, "Okay, if this is real, it has to be around here somewhere."

116
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:25,520
 So they begin looking around for other salt flats in the area, and they find it and they test it over and over and over again.

117
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 Nothing.

118
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 So this is what's interesting about this story, and it kind of plays it--this is a cryptid.

119
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 And it's a microscopic cryptid that existed in a time, and then where it existed got destroyed.

120
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,520
 Completely--as far as we know--obliterating that life form.

121
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 Because it was around and moving in 1892.

122
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 And then it was turned into a pasture for cows to eat on.

123
00:18:51,520 --> 00:19:00,520
 And I find that fascinating because, one, you think--when we look back to stories of--the classic stories of the Bigfoot that you had,

124
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,520
 like, the natives in America were like, "Oh, yeah, there's some dude walking around. He's a big old Bigfoot."

125
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,520
 And the settlers coming out there and them being like, "Oh, there's a big monster walking around with a big old Bigfoot."

126
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 But then the stories today may be less true or just made up because they're the same thing with the buffalo.

127
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
 People are just blasting these things or they're like, "I'm out of here."

128
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,520
 And they're walking further up north and they're like, "Ah, it's too cold and they freeze to death."

129
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
 All of these cryptids could exist in some area.

130
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 Loch Ness Monster could have been real in the 1600s, but someone killed it or just was like, "I'm out of here."

131
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
 Apparently that's what cryptids do. They're just like, "Ah, too many people."

132
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,520
 But you know what I mean? This might give us an idea that cryptids could have existed at a certain point.

133
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,520
 What we perceive as monsters could have existed, but then simply they're--they may be more real than we give them credit for.

134
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,520
 The Bigfoot, a bit walking around, disappearing, going to other dimensions, piloting spaceships, so that's an upcoming story.

135
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,520
 That stuff could all be fanciful. The idea that, 100, 200 years back, there were Bigfoot creatures in America that simply left.

136
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,520
 Their environment was destroyed. People pushed them out. People were building houses. Too much travel.

137
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:14,520
 Bigfoot's like, "Eh, me leave now. Me go to Himalayas." And then he's like, "Ah, no places here."

138
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,520
 And then he goes to Australia and that's the--I don't know. Now he's basically wearing the world's his carmentine Diego.

139
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,520
 My point is, is that it's interesting because Argentina has the more realistic cryptids.

140
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,520
 And here we have one that probably did exist, that got just destroyed, because someone wanted to put a farm there.

141
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:39,520
 So to this day, there is a debate in the community. Were these things real? Like, did the he/the guy actually observe these?

142
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:46,520
 Did a reputable science--scientists observe these and sketch them? Or, would you just make it up like any other cryptid story?

143
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,520
 So, that is our--I think he probably--I think they're probably real. I think that's the most logical thing.

144
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 And I think that could--you could even go to stories about like elves and gnomes. There could have been these people in these areas that just got wiped out as human migration.

145
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 The superior species began moving across the--I mean, imagine you were a gnome and like you lived in a mushroom and then some dude came and plowed it over and started planting wheat.

146
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,520
 You're kind of boned, right? You can't go to like city council and get it rezoned, mushroom zone. You got to leave.

147
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 So that could be--that's an extreme example. I'm sure if a gnome walked in a city council, people would be like, "Dude, we will let you do whatever just give us your gold."

148
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 And he's like, "That's a leprechaun." And I'm offended. But maybe we're just encroaching on cryptid territory.

149
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,520
 Now, I do have to say this. I don't--I do have some other Argentine stories coming up.

150
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,520
 I have a conspiracy one, kind of a mystery one, a true crime one. It's kind of cool.

151
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 But anyways, let's go ahead, though, and move on to our next story. So, everyone, let's go ahead and leave Argentina.

152
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,520
 Again, Argentina, thank you so much for supporting the show, the entire country's behind us. We're so--we're doing so well over there.

153
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,520
 Take us up, Gun of Liberty, zero, zero. And as we're flying away, we notice that gun has like a little--a little satchel.

154
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 And he looks over at us, teary-eyed, and we're like, "Dude, what's--why don't you just fly the helicopter? Quit getting all teary-eyed, emotional."

155
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 And he's like, "I collect--I mine--my great-grandfather was Michael Scrotal. And you made fun of my name, and here's my--this long-descendant, snail people."

156
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:23,520
 So, we're saying goodbye to Argentina. We're saying goodbye to the Molask--the Molask collector, Michael Scrotal.

157
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,520
 And we're taking off. And that--and we are flying out to La Crosse, Wisconsin.

158
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 Now, this story here--let me just tell the story, and then I'll get into it. It's May 24th, 2005, in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

159
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 And now we're walking down the street, and we see a house. And in this house is a man named--also, unfortunately, named Matthew Balsrena--

160
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:06,520
 Matthew Balsrena. Matthew Balsrena. He's 21 years old. Now, I did not think of these two names. I did not think of Bals and Scrotal while I was putting these two stories together.

161
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:16,520
 Matthew Balsrena. Right? Poor guy. He's 21 years old. And he's staying at a friend's house in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

162
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 He's trying to raise money to go to Florida. He has big plans. 21 years old. He's got big plans when you're 21. You should have big plans when you're 81.

163
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 You should never stop having plans. That's what keeps you going. But when you're 21, the world is your oyster. The world is your sack.

164
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:39,520
 And for Balsrena, he was ready to just get on in it and bounce around. Knowledge makes no sense, but you get the joke. I hope.

165
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:54,520
 So anyways, Balsrena is hanging out. Now, it's the morning of the 24th, May 24th. He tells a friend of his, "There's a demon. There's a demon. And I think he's going to get me to kill somebody."

166
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:08,520
 Now, here's the thing. You're 21 years old. This guy's a drug user. He smokes weed. People are try-hards. People--it's funny because there's different--as me being 43 years old.

167
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:18,520
 If a friend of mine, who a 21-year-old kid came up to me that I know pretty well, and says, "I think there's a demon trying to make me kill somebody."

168
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:27,520
 As a 43-year-old, I would say, "You probably should talk to someone about this." Like, "Well, you can talk to me, assuming I might keep this crucifix near me."

169
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 But we can have a talk, but I would talk to him and figure stuff out and then go--we might want to go talk to somebody else.

170
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 Like, let's go down to the hospital and--or let's go to a church that actually is out of the hospital.

171
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,520
 He's like, "Hey, I see the steeple off in the distance. Yeah, yeah, let's go to the hospital first. I forgot something there."

172
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,520
 And anyways, get him treated. When you're 21 and one of your friends, you know, "I'm smoking weed. You're smoking weed."

173
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,520
 We're listening to some, you know, like, Chronic 2001 smoking weed. The dude on the couch next to me is like, "Ffff."

174
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,520
 I think that--I think there's a demon trying to get me to kill somebody.

175
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,520
 I'm just going to be like, "I'm going to think--" What a tryhard. This guy's such a dork.

176
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 "Ffff." Oh, yeah.

177
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:21,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, buddy. I might humor him a bit, but I probably don't care. I probably just figure he's being a tryhard.

178
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 So I get that the friend did nothing. Ball's arena, talking about a demon trying to get him to murder somebody.

179
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 Probably not the first time he brought it up, whatever. But obviously, you know, this story is from 2005.

180
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
 Recovering this 15 years later, this wasn't just all talk.

181
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,520
 Later that morning, he goes to his best friend's house in town.

182
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 And he had borrowed a slow cooker from his best friend and his best friend's girlfriend, Sarah Dobbs.

183
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 She's 23 years old. And Matthew is like, "Oh, I'm going to return this slow cooker and probably just hang out, smoke a little more weed."

184
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,520
 You know, why not? I'm 21. He shows up at his best friend's house and Sarah Dobbs is there alone.

185
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
 And she goes, "Do you want to go in the back, smoke some weed?" And he's like, "Yeah, I should."

186
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,520
 "What? Why--I didn't plan on it. I don't know. I'm not wearing my weed-smoking shoes, but sure, why not?"

187
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 So they go into the back bedroom and Sarah and Matthew are smoking weed.

188
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:20,520
 Everything's relaxed. It's mid-morning. It's just actually the perfect time to be smoking weed, honestly.

189
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,520
 And Sarah looks over at Matthew and goes, "Can I tell you something?"

190
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
 Thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend.

191
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,520
 Now, Matthew gets really upset by this, because that's his best friend.

192
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,520
 And for whatever reason, she told--I'm assuming Sarah and Matthew are good friends as well.

193
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,520
 Because if my significant other's best friend is sitting in front of me, I'm not going to tell them

194
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,520
 and thinking about breaking up with my girl, right?

195
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,520
 But if we were also really good friends, I may figure that our friendship will at least keep that secret.

196
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,520
 There's also the possibility--and I remember when I read the story back in 2005, because I remember reading it.

197
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 I remember I was telling other people about the story. I find the story absolutely fascinating.

198
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,520
 And my friend, Steve, goes, "I bet you she liked Matthew. I bet you that Sarah liked Matthew."

199
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 And that's why she felt comfortable saying that, like, thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend.

200
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 The implication is to be with you.

201
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,520
 And it was weird, because I told Steve, I had the exact same feeling that--but we don't know.

202
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,520
 We don't know. But I think that read-a-story makes what comes next truly horrific.

203
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,520
 But for whatever reason, she admits to Matthew that she wants to break up with his best friend.

204
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 And again, I kind of get the feeling that the implication was, "Let's go into this back bedroom.

205
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
 Let's smoke weed. I want to break up with my boyfriend."

206
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 Dot, dot, dot, to be with you.

207
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,520
 Those words are never spoken, but that's the read I got on it.

208
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 However, Matthew--this is back to the actual story, the facts that we know--Mathieu gets upset.

209
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 But he doesn't show it. It doesn't show it that Sarah's going to break up with his best friend.

210
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 He's getting to him, but he gets up and he goes into the bathroom and he's freaking out.

211
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
 Like, not like, "Oh, no, no, no, no!"

212
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:13,520
 Like, really, really mad, furious that this girl was going to betray his best friend.

213
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
 He's just washing his hands.

214
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 [shushing]

215
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 Washing his hands with soap.

216
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
 "How do you normally wash your hands?"

217
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,520
 The water's running. It's hot. It's burning his hands.

218
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520
 He's stoned, though. He doesn't care. He's just thinking, "Stupid girl!"

219
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 "Bah!"

220
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
 Saying bad words that Jason's not going to repeat on the podcast.

221
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
 [growls]

222
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,520
 And then he looks in the mirror and sees the demon.

223
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 This demon's name, according to Matthew, is Sozuto.

224
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 And it's looking at him through the mirror.

225
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,520
 Sozuto is staring at him and begins to speak.

226
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,520
 "She's bogus! She's trying to screw your boy over!"

227
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,520
 And Matthew's just staring at this demon face, looking in the mirror.

228
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,520
 Matthew feels something enter his body.

229
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 [howling]

230
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
 Everything tenses up.

231
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 He's in the passenger seat now in his own body.

232
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 And he walks out into the bedroom.

233
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 Sarah is just sitting there, taking another hit.

234
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,520
 [deep breath]

235
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 And Matthew walks up and punches her right in the face, hits her right in the eye,

236
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,520
 and she falls to the ground and he begins screaming at her.

237
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,520
 "How could you betray him? How could you betray him?"

238
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 And begins just punching her as she's on the ground.

239
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
 Sarah jumps up and tries to run.

240
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
 And that's when Matthew grabs a knife.

241
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,520
 It's funny because a lot of times in these types of stories,

242
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,520
 you have people, and really just the life in general, you have fighters.

243
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,520
 They say there's fight, flight, or freeze.

244
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
 You never know who you are until your life is tested.

245
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,520
 Most people imagine themselves as fighters, but you just don't know.

246
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
 And then there's fighters, and then there's warriors.

247
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
 He orders Sarah to get on the ground. She won't do it.

248
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 She's getting back up as he's holding this knife.

249
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,520
 Now he tells police later, he was just trying to scare her.

250
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,520
 He was going to hold her at knife point until the boyfriend came home,

251
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,520
 and then he was going to make her confess what she had said.

252
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
 But that's not the way things play out here.

253
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,520
 Because Sarah won't stay on the ground.

254
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
 She's really thinking the worst, honestly.

255
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
 Someone with a knife is telling you, they've already attacked you,

256
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
 telling you to get on the ground, get on the ground.

257
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
 You're not thinking, "Oh, he's just going to keep me at knife point for eight hours

258
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 until my boyfriend gets off work."

259
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 You don't know what's going to happen.

260
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
 She starts to get up. He's still yelling at her.

261
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
 "Stay down, stay down."

262
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
 They start fighting.

263
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
 And of course, he has a knife.

264
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
 So he has advantage.

265
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,520
 He begins stabbing her over and over.

266
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,520
 He stabs her so many times so violently that the handle breaks from the knife.

267
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
 So now he's just holding a broken handle,

268
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,520
 and there's a knife blade sticking out of Sarah.

269
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
 And she looks at him.

270
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,520
 She pulls the blade out of her

271
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 and begins stabbing.

272
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,520
 Matthew begins slashing at him,

273
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
 cutting his hands, cutting his arms, cutting his face.

274
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
 He's in a defensive posture now.

275
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
 He's holding his hands up.

276
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
 She's bleeding profusely,

277
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,520
 and the blade that had previously been buried in her own body,

278
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,520
 she's now turned into a weapon against her attacker.

279
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
 A warrior.

280
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,520
 Unfortunately, the hero wouldn't win this battle.

281
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 She had already been stabbed multiple times.

282
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
 She was bleeding very badly.

283
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,520
 And although she was able to cut this horrible evil man up,

284
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
 he was able to overpower her,

285
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
 get her to the ground,

286
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,520
 and eventually suffocate her until she was dead.

287
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,520
 Once she dies,

288
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
 like he's--

289
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
 Matthew says, "I know the moment she died."

290
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,520
 Because then, Sozuto's voice was in my head,

291
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
 and it said, "You're mine now."

292
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,520
 And Matthew was empty.

293
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
 He was no longer possessed.

294
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 He felt the demon leave his body,

295
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,520
 and now he's looking at a dead woman on the floor in front of him.

296
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,520
 Panic sets in, obviously.

297
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
 He tries to dispose of the body.

298
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
 He goes on and throws it in the garbage can, puts it in the garbage can.

299
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
 The garbage can breaks.

300
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
 He goes, "It's like a big bin."

301
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
 He's trying to clean up blood. He can't do it.

302
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,520
 He goes, "I'm just going to set the house on fire."

303
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,520
 So he starts pouring gasoline everywhere.

304
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,520
 And before he even thinks about lighting it,

305
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
 he's pouring gasoline everywhere,

306
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,520
 then he's looking for a way to light it.

307
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,520
 All of a sudden,

308
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,520
 the room explodes in flames,

309
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,520
 which he rationalizes as the demon

310
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,520
 coming back one more time to help him clean up the crime scene.

311
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
 Matthew leaves the crime scene,

312
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,520
 and at first investigators think that it was a horrible accident,

313
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 that the house burned down, and she died.

314
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
 She succumbed to the smoke.

315
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 But then it didn't take him long to realize,

316
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
 "Oh, there's gasoline everywhere."

317
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
 This wasn't an accident.

318
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
 That same day,

319
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
 he gets fired from his job,

320
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
 and then steals a car from his job and goes on the run.

321
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,520
 What's funny is, like, they weren't really suspecting anyone.

322
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
 They noticed that there was gasoline,

323
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
 but they didn't put two and two together.

324
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,520
 They were actually looking for him because he stole the car.

325
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
 They catch him on June 3rd in Minnesota,

326
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 and when he gets arrested, he tells the cops,

327
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
 "I will not say a word."

328
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 Not confessing anything,

329
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
 until there's a priest in this room,

330
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
 and I get exercised.

331
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,520
 Cops look at each other.

332
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,520
 What? Over car theft? Like, what's going on?

333
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
 Now, there's no word to whether he got the exorcism.

334
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,520
 There's no detail whether or not the priest actually came.

335
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,520
 But he did actually end up confessing to this crime.

336
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,520
 He tells the story about the demon in the mirror.

337
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,520
 He actually uses the quotes that said Sarah was bogus,

338
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
 and that a quote trying to screw your boy over.

339
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
 Those were actual quotes that the demon was saying.

340
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
 He pleads insanity.

341
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
 He says the demon made him do it.

342
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
 Then he changes his plea to guilty.

343
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
 He was hoping at some point, he pled guilty because he was hoping that he wouldn't spend life in prison,

344
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
 that he'd have a chance of doing parole.

345
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
 And they said, "If you want to plead guilty,

346
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,520
 if you want to have the possibility of parole,

347
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
 you have to admit you did it,

348
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,520
 and the demon story was totally made up."

349
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
 And he goes, "I did it.

350
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,520
 The demon story was totally made up.

351
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
 He got life in prison. No parole."

352
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,520
 The judge of the case said that this trial gave him nightmares.

353
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
 He terrified him.

354
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,520
 He deserved to be locked up, never have a chance to get out.

355
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,520
 I find this story super fascinating on so many levels.

356
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 This story I'd actually remembered from 15 years ago,

357
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
 but I didn't remember enough of the details.

358
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
 Every so often I'd try to Google it and find it, pull it up.

359
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
 But I never remembered enough of the details.

360
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
 You type in like, "Demon possession murder."

361
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 That happens a lot.

362
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 That happens a lot, or a link me to a movie or something like that.

363
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,520
 I found this story in my new news folder,

364
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 which longtime listeners of the show know that I have a folder of articles I saved

365
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,520
 back from 2004-2005 for another podcast I was doing.

366
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,520
 And then I stopped doing that podcast and I had lost track of this folder.

367
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
 I found it again and I have all these old articles.

368
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,520
 This was one of them and I was so happy because I loved this story.

369
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
 They're so...

370
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,520
 It's a typical true crime story in the fact that you have a brutal man murdering a victim.

371
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,520
 A young woman who's starting her life off.

372
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
 You have this idiot taking her life.

373
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,520
 Then you have the added thing about this demonic link to it.

374
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
 But there's so many other...

375
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,520
 I remember when this story came out, I had the conversation with Steve and I go,

376
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,520
 "Was she confessing her love?"

377
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 Like if he hadn't gone bonkers with this gone another way, that she was confessing his love.

378
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
 Which I think again adds that other horrible layer.

379
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,520
 Like you imagine this girl finally getting up the nerve to tell a guy that she likes him.

380
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,520
 Then the next thing you know, he comes out of the bathroom and punches her right in the eye.

381
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,520
 Now it's possible that that's a subtext that's not true.

382
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
 But even then just hanging out with your friend and saying,

383
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,520
 "Hey, I'm thinking about leaving somebody."

384
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,520
 And then that person coming out and assaulting you is bad enough.

385
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
 Then there's the...

386
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,520
 And this is the other really weird concept I had involving this story.

387
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
 It's kind of a thought experiment.

388
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
 I remember I was talking to my little brother about this,

389
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
 because again, this story really engaged me when I was back...

390
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
 15 years ago I was...

391
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
 What have been what? Like I can't really do math.

392
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
 It's 28, something like that?

393
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
 I don't remember, 27.

394
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
 I remember reading this story and being like,

395
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
 "Oh, this is fascinating."

396
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,520
 You have the true crime element, you have the demonic element.

397
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
 Did he...

398
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 Was the demon real?

399
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
 Was it a way to plead insanity?

400
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
 Was it somewhere in between?

401
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
 Who knows.

402
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
 But here's my question.

403
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
 And this is...

404
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
 I want to see what you guys think too.

405
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
 So I've told you that story.

406
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
 He looks in the mirror and he sees the demon.

407
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
 What did the demon look like?

408
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
 No, I'm not asking, did it have horns?

409
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
 Did you picture like horns or red skin?

410
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
 Or was it face all wrinkly like the Wishmaster or what?

411
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
 Or was it just Matthew's reflection,

412
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
 but he had like a goatee and like angry eyebrows?

413
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
 I'm not talking about that.

414
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 This is what trips me out about this.

415
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
 This guy looks in the mirror and he sees a demon.

416
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
 What did it look like?

417
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,520
 Was it CGI?

418
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,520
 Did it look like a CGI demon?

419
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
 Super detailed.

420
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,520
 Did it look like a man in a rubber mask?

421
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,520
 Like almost like a Power Ranger type mask, a monstrous face,

422
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 but you can almost tell that it's like rubbery.

423
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,520
 Did it look like a human but slightly deformed,

424
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
 like a vampire from Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

425
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 You're like Jason, you're just naming on...

426
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
 Think about it though.

427
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,520
 If a demon appeared in your bedroom right now,

428
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,520
 or the backseat of your car is driving out of the road,

429
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
 or in your summoning circle,

430
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,520
 because you listen to the podcast while you bring forth the dark old ones,

431
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
 what do they look like?

432
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,520
 Again, I'm not asking about the visual.

433
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,520
 I'm asking about the origin or the material they will be made of.

434
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
 It trips me out because I said in my story

435
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,520
 where I said like I saw the demon clown driving the car,

436
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
 that was on the...

437
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
 If you're like whoa, I don't remember that.

438
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,520
 That was in the episode the demons surround us about demonic possession.

439
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,520
 This clown, this demonic clown was driving through the neighborhood I was in,

440
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,520
 and I said I could almost see the musculature of this face moving.

441
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
 It seemed very realistic,

442
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
 but at the same time there was something phony about it.

443
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
 My mind was telling me something's not right there.

444
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
 So if you're looking in the mirror and you see a demon,

445
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,520
 I honestly, what I picture is I picture really bad Power Ranger makeup,

446
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
 or close to the Wishmaster being like,

447
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 "She's bogus!"

448
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,520
 Or like, "Faust," that superhero movie.

449
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,520
 I imagine it like really bad like 1990.

450
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
 Actually that was top of the line special effects back then,

451
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
 but you know what I mean?

452
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,520
 Kind of cheesy Power Ranger monster makeup.

453
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 Looking at him.

454
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
 "Ahhh!"

455
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,520
 But you could also go, it could easily been like a CGI monster.

456
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
 And I know you might be thinking,

457
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,520
 "Jason, that's your takeaway on this horrible true crime story?"

458
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
 Yeah, yeah, it kind of is.

459
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
 I mean, I like the fact that she was able to fight back

460
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
 and slash this little punk up.

461
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
 But I find it interesting that someone could look into the mirror

462
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
 and see this demon.

463
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,520
 And it opens up a whole gateway as far as what he saw.

464
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,520
 Other than like, not just what he saw as the demon,

465
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,520
 but what was it made out of?

466
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
 How was the...

467
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
 Does it look just like a human with a monstrous face?

468
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
 I don't know.

469
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,520
 And I want to address this too, the place igniting.

470
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,520
 He says he's pouring gasoline before he even lit it on fire to ignite it.

471
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
 That's actually scientifically...

472
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,520
 Enough gasoline spread about an area.

473
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,520
 It can just combust.

474
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
 The fumes, it's some sort of interaction thing.

475
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
 Like if you take oily rags and keep them in the garage,

476
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,520
 fire will like start in a bucket of oily rags.

477
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 These things will happen.

478
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,520
 So I don't think that appoints...

479
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,520
 I think that actually happened, but it's not a supernatural answer.

480
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
 I will say this though.

481
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
 Let's say this demon was kind of lurking around Matthew

482
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
 and starting to influencing him.

483
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
 I've stopped doing drugs at that point.

484
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
 If you're like, "Oh man, whenever he gets stoned, a demon shows up."

485
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
 I know, I'm just going to keep getting stoned.

486
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
 You know, you probably stay off the weed at that point.

487
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,520
 But let's assume the story, his story is true.

488
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
 That he was being stalked by this demon.

489
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,520
 I think it's interesting that demon basically took him over,

490
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,520
 possessed him, attacked Sarah, killed Sarah,

491
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
 and then says, "You're mine now."

492
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
 And disappears.

493
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,520
 Was the demon trying to remove Matthew from the plane board?

494
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,520
 Was Matthew supposed to be someone special?

495
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
 And the demon targeted him, singled him out,

496
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
 got him thrown in prison for the rest of his life?

497
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,520
 How close was Matthew already to being pushed?

498
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,520
 Obviously, I don't smoke weed, but if I was smoking weed

499
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,520
 and I looked in my mirror, there's a demon floating around in it.

500
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
 And it tries to possess me.

501
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 I'm going to be like, "No, I'm out.

502
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,520
 I'm just going to walk away slowly."

503
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,520
 I think you kind of have to open yourself up to that.

504
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,520
 One, also being stoned and staring in the mirror

505
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,520
 probably is not a good way to not get possessed.

506
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 But could a normal guy happen to be walking by the house at that time?

507
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,520
 And so Zudo is like leaving the mirror.

508
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 He's like, "Oh, no. This guy sucks. Bye, Matthew."

509
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,520
 He's like, "No, no. Come back."

510
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
 He crawls that window.

511
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
 Could the demon have possessed anyone?

512
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,520
 Or was the fact that Ball's arena was already so stoned

513
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
 and already so angry and kind of lost

514
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,520
 and was trying to like find a new life?

515
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
 Is that what made the demon target him out?

516
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
 How long was this demon stalking him?

517
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
 Did it have a connection to the weed?

518
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,520
 Had he been stoned sober, could any of this happened?

519
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,520
 Who knows.

520
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
 Who absolutely knows.

521
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,520
 I, you're mine now is what the demon says.

522
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
 This guy's basically in prison for the rest of his life.

523
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,520
 Was Matthew, did he have a destiny that was going to take him somewhere in this demon?

524
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,520
 Tipped up the board game and removed the powerful piece and am thrown in prison?

525
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
 Who knows?

526
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
 Why did the demon singled him out?

527
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
 Who knows? Who knows?

528
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,520
 There's so many questions about this story.

529
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,520
 And then you have the fact of this kick-ass chick.

530
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
 I mean, again, I've been in a couple fights in my life.

531
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,520
 I've never pulled a knife out of my own body and began stabbing someone with it.

532
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
 That's some...

533
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,520
 If you saw that in a movie, you would think that was made up.

534
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
 But she was determined to live.

535
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,520
 On an equal footing, had he come out of that bathroom and she was in a fighter's pose,

536
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
 this dude would have been dusted.

537
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,520
 Demon or not, it would have been two on one.

538
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
 Sarah could have taken him out.

539
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
 The whole story is fascinating to me.

540
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,520
 And it's that perfect intersection of true crime and the paranormal,

541
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,520
 which is something I talked about 400 episodes ago.

542
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,520
 I think they intersect more often than we'd like to hope.

543
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,520
 Because it's one thing if you're getting mugged in a dark alley,

544
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,520
 "Guy has a gun to you. Give me all your money."

545
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 But it's something totally different if you're woke up in the middle of the night,

546
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,520
 someone smashed in your front door, you jump out of bed,

547
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
 and you see a man standing in your pitch black living room.

548
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
 And even though barely any light is penetrating through the drapes,

549
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:32,520
 you see something darker than black standing behind the man.

550
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,520
 You're not just being robbed.

551
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,520
 You're not just being attacked by one man.

552
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:48,520
 You have to face down this criminal and the demon in control of him.

553
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:58,520
 In that moment, are you a warrior, or are you a victim?
