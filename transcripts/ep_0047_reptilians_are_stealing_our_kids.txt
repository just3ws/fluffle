 Apple sensors Alex Jones and child molestine reptilians have taken over
 Antarctica today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your
 host Jason Carpenter I'm having a great day I hope you're having a great day. Got
 a lot of good stories for you today. Today's actually the first day of my
 vacation so that's pretty awesome. Took a long nap. Don't really have much planned.
 Napping, working on the podcast, hanging out with my family, stuff like that would be pretty cool.
 You know this is a weird thing I don't know how many of my audience does drugs.
 I assume it's probably like a 50/50 split maybe a little bit more and when I
 say drugs I mean like basic drugs like marijuana. I'm not talking like how much
 of my audience is heroin which I'm sure is an insignificant amount but what I
 think is interesting have you ever done drugs in your dreams? Every show often
 I'll have a dream where I smoke weed. I don't smoke weed anymore because I get
 drug tested all the time but I I've had dreams where I've done drugs in my
 dreams and the dream like your dream state becomes incredible. It becomes
 basically what you think drugs do to you when you're a kid like when you're a kid
 you think drugs make Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck dance around in front of
 you and it's not the case. Spoiler alert for anyone who hasn't smoked marijuana
 it's not that cool. It does make television incredibly amazing but it
 doesn't make you hallucinate. Well I did hallucinate a couple times but anyway
 that's beside the point. The point is is that in dreams or I've done drugs it's
 totally tripped me out. It's been the most intense experience. So my question I
 wonder why I've actually heard other people say that too when they do drugs
 in their dreams it's like the most intense possible experience and I'm
 wondering if because the brain is trying to simulate the effect of the drug it
 just goes overboard or actually I just thought of this maybe when you do drugs
 you do have this totally intense impact on your brain but you can only perceive
 so much information while that's going on. So you may actually your brain to your
 brain it could be like some sort of cataclysmic slash orgasmic event but
 because your ego couldn't handle that it kind of just makes you want to eat
 Taco Bell and watch The Sweet Life on Deck. So I don't know but yeah whenever
 I've done drugs in my dreams it's the most intense drug experience ever. So let's
 talk about the big news of the day. Again I'm recording this on Monday but you'll
 be hearing it on Friday because we're doing the pre-recording so I don't have
 much of a gap while I'm on vacation. But the big news of the day Monday is that
 Alex Jones was taken off of iTunes. His podcast four of his five podcasts were
 taken off of iTunes. He was I believe taken completely off of Spotify. Facebook
 has shut down some of his pages. YouTube I think as of now may still have one or
 two of it like they were taking down individual videos. iTunes announced that
 they were taking down his podcast at three in the morning local time which is
 unusual. I think they knew that these other sites were going to take him down
 and iTunes wanted to be first they wanted to set the benchmark. Here's my
 thing about Alex Jones. So when I first I used to be a 9/11 truth or I used to be
 more believing in these conspiracy theories and that's when people go do
 your research do your research. I was reading about Osama bin Laden when he
 gave an interview I think it was with Time Magazine or Newsweek back in 2000. I
 was researching 9/11 on 9/12 like I was into that truth or movement and into
 those conspiracy theories conspiracy theories and spent years and
 years and years looking into it and I always say generally you fall down the
 rabbit hole and eventually you end up back on the surface and you go out of
 everything's fake that's all nonsense. If you keep an open mind you fall through
 the rabbit hole you come back and you're like yeah it wasn't a waste of time I
 enjoyed the journey but most of the conspiracies out there are complete and
 utter garbage entertaining garbage but garbage nonetheless so I used to go to
 Info Wars and Prison Planet back in 2001-2002. It was amazing it was this huge
 treasure trove of conspiracy thought. I've always seen Alex Jones as an
 entertainer first and a quote-unquote journalist second and for lack of a
 better term. I think Alex Jones had a character I think he might have originally
 believed some of the stuff he says but I don't think he actually believes most of
 it. I think you would have to be a lunatic to believe every every single
 thing that he's talked about over the years. It would drive you mad so I
 believe it's an act during his divorce with his wife his defense lawyer said
 as much he doesn't act like this around his kids this is a performance that he
 puts on and he lost that case by the way his wife is getting a ton of money
 through alimony because he cheated on her apparently I don't know allegedly I
 guess I should say. Now if you are a journalist and you are stating facts and
 you can show your work basically is a term I like to use a lot with the
 conspiracy theory community you can say what you want you can say reptilians are
 taken over the planet but show your work show me documents show me proof and
 I'll believe you I'll be on your side but if you can't show your work then
 you're no different than someone telling me that China is making fake cabbage
 you're using undisclosed surface sources you're using people that are easily
 disputed and so on and so forth. Alex Jones can't show his work if Alex Jones
 could actually show his work and say Sandy Hook was fake which is one of the
 big lawsuits he's facing now by two families of Sandy Hook victims if he
 could prove that if a journalist or a researcher can prove that you have that
 as your defense but when you're just acting when you're just making it up
 and then people say what you're saying is hateful you have no defense well you
 have one which is the First Amendment but that one covers you from the
 government and two it only covers you in the United States and what iTunes and
 Google and Spotify and YouTube and all these groups can say is one we're a
 private company so we can choose what's on our platform and we feel you are
 being hateful Mr. Jones or yes you are protected by the First Amendment in the
 United States but because we are a global company we have to follow basically
 the strictest laws the way America works is that generally the strictest law is
 what you fall under if California has very strict gun control laws but the
 this nation has more lax gun control laws generally fall under the purview of
 the strictest law and I think that's what's happening to Alex Jones. Alex
 Jones what they are saying is that he makes hateful content towards
 gays, transgendered people, and Muslims in particular so they took his shows off.
 Do I think that causes a problem for the conspiracy community in large? Do I
 think that the fact that these outlets are banning Alex Jones do I think it
 makes an impact on the conspiracy theory community at large? I do. I think it may
 make a positive impact. I think Alex Jones has been such a magnet of attention
 that if he's no longer the most visible voice in the conspiracy community I
 think it may be taken a little more seriously. I think generally when you
 start talking about conspiracies or something like that and someone can
 immediately just go "Water's turning the frogs gay!" it dismisses it all. Now to be
 fair most conspiracy theories deserve to get dismissed but I think you know what
 I'm saying he is so bombastic and so such a caricature of a conspiracy
 theorist I think that it may help. I think it'll make room for other people to
 kind of move up in that conspiracy theory realm. Do I think that as society at
 large it is beneficial to have Alex Jones removed? No, I don't. I don't. Now to be
 fair on that the comments that he makes that some would consider hateful and to
 be honest I don't watch the show. I went to the website a lot but that was
 before he did his show. I've only seen the clips most people have seen so when
 they say that he's hateful towards gays or transgendered or Muslim people I
 don't know. So they're making that claim and I don't know. I haven't seen any
 clips or anything like that but I think for society at large for some of the
 biggest content providers to shut someone down because they say they're
 producing hate speech when in general he's not known for producing hate
 speech in general he's known for saying crazy things about Sandy Hook and 9/11
 and say Tannock pedophile, Stake on the World and stuff like that. He's not
 Richard Spencer where that's all he's saying. He generally makes these wacky
 conspiracy theories and I think what the problem is is that we have him deep
 platforms from some of the major major platforms. I've heard the term this is
 basically digital book burning because he will be gone. It costs a lot to host
 the podcast or especially video on your own site. The upload download the bandwidth
 is insane so you get deep platform from these major major platforms. There's
 nothing else for him to really distribute his content and you know keep his
 company going. And I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a
 Roseanne James Gunn situation where the left takes out Roseanne for her tweet
 about a black woman look like a monkey which I can't believe that she still
 wrote that. And then the right takes out James Gunn for tweeting jokes about
 pedophilia and it just becomes this tit for tat this back-and-forth thing. I
 think that's what we're going to see. What the next big push will be to get
 young Turks de-platformed or something like that. And I don't think that type
 of tribal warfare is good for society. I don't think that it's good for the
 culture. So yeah it'll be interesting. I have and I have a feeling that this isn't
 going to last very long. I have a feeling that this is going to be revoked.
 So that they are going to allow him back on the platforms. Because I just don't.
 I don't see it sticking. I think he could if he can prove that I never made those
 hateful comments or those that video that I supposedly made a hateful comment
 had been up for two years on iTunes. So it'll be interesting to see how this
 plays out. But again I think for the community for the conspiracy theory
 community it's nice to have one of the biggest most laughable characters in it
 removed is beneficial because then more more thought-provoking or more well
 thought-out conspiracy theorists can move to the top. But I think as society at
 large I don't think it's a good thing. So we'll see how this plays out. Okay last
 story of the day we're going out there. And when I say out there we're going from
 outer space to ice in your face. I don't know I couldn't come up with anything for
 that. So apparently this again this seems to be a political episode but it just
 happened to be that way. So what's going on according to this truth seeker this
 man above men this fear bean. Fear bean? That's his website. So there's this guy
 named Corey Good. So quick info on Corey Good. Corey Good has been kidnapped
 multiple times by the United States Air Force. I mean just like they've come in
 and they've taken him and they're like how are you revealing all of our secrets
 and Corey Good's like I can't tell you and the Air Force is like tell us who's
 the leak and Corey Good's like I won't tell you the Air Force lets him go.
 Because what you know that's what military is known for. They're known for
 taking people prisoner and then letting them go when they don't get what they
 want. This happened multiple times. Poor Corey Good being abducted. Where are you
 getting your secrets? Who is leaking our info to you and Corey Good's like I will
 not tell you. And then one day Corey Good is taken in by a secret U.S. Air Force
 agent who works for special space command named Sigmund and the agent goes
 who's giving you this information and Corey Good goes aliens are talking on my
 brain and the agent goes yes you are right aliens are talking to your brain
 here's even more secret documents for you to leak. Together we can destroy the
 pedophiles who are taking over the planet. So now Corey Good is no longer
 being kidnapped by the U.S. Air Force. He's working for them along with his
 telepathic alien baby in his brain and what he has to report this time is that
 special teams of soldiers from around the world is like a straight-up GI Joe are
 capturing high-level world powerful pedophiles. Get down on the ground pedophile.
 No I own eight banks in Europe stay down. Watch I'm gonna get flagged for hate
 speech because of that accent. The pedophile anti-pedophile special forces
 teams have been raiding groups across the United States and they're shocked
 shocked at how deeply these people are in the U.S. government. This team has been
 in effect by the way in the middle since the middle of the election but since
 Donald Trump's become president it's become totally ramped up and at this
 point a special forces some of them have actually been fired unfortunately from
 this made-up job. They're having to collect made-up unemployment. They've
 been fired from this made-up job for killing low-level pedophiles. That has
 to be the worst description ever. That not only are you a pedophile you're a
 low-level pedophile. That's like you only have sex with baby ducks. Like you
 don't even qualify to be as gross as a regular pedophile you're just a low-level
 pedophile. Other pedophiles look down on you. Anyway so these special forces
 squads a couple of these guys have been fired from this made-up job because
 they've been killing these low-level pedophiles because they're just so angry.
 Now before we get into the weird part let me just do an aside. Yes there are we
 do have a pedophile problem. It's everywhere and it's super gross. Before I
 go any further I think I need to make this clear. I'm not making fun of
 pedophilia and yes there are powerful people out there who are pedophiles.
 What I have a problem with is the idea that a pedophilic network is running
 the planet. I think that idea is laughable. I think that there are private
 groups of people who want to have their vision of the world put onto everyone
 else. I think that is such a basic description of the illuminati or
 conspiracies. I think that's fair. I think that if I had a billion dollars I
 would want people I would want to leave my impact on the world and I would want
 the world to see the world as I see it because I think I know what I'm doing
 is right. So when you have George Soros or you have the what is it the Koch
 brothers the Koch brothers they're both the same thing. They're opposing forces
 but they're both the same thing. They both have massive amounts of money and
 they use that money to reshape the world and how they see it. I do not think that
 they're both pedophiles that know a million other pedophiles that are
 running the planet and if the Koch brothers knew that George Soros was a
 pedophile or vice versa that'd be the first attack line every single day.
 One of them goes, you know, my opponent believes that climate change is not
 man-made and the other people would be like he's a pedophile. That would be the
 only conversation ever. So either they're both pedophiles and in that case it
 doesn't matter because everyone's a pedophile or one is and one isn't and
 that would be the only line of attack ever. This person believes that taxes on
 corporations should be 10% that person's a pedophile. That would be every single
 conversation and all of these stories would be buried 100% of the time
 because if everyone in the power structure even let's say 10% or 2% of
 the world's power structure was powerful enough to not only hide their own
 crimes but initiate other people into their group. We would never hear about
 any of these stories. Corey Goode would be a smudge at the bottom of the
 Empire State Building. So that's my problem with these stories about these
 worldwide groups of super powerful people that are doing this Illuminati
 Satanic pedophilia group. There are powerful people who are pedophiles
 absolutely. There are networks of pedophiles absolutely. Those are facts. We
 catch them. We bust them not as often as we should but we do. But this idea like
 Corey Goode's putting forth that local police are in on it. Local reporters are
 in on it. Low level politicians are in on it.
 Entertainment industry is in on it. Politicians like if the local cop is in
 on it then he's the weakest link. Why is he part of your global? Why is he
 banging kids with George Soros in Vienna? It doesn't make sense. Think about this
 stuff for one second please. It gets me... you know the reason why these stories
 get me so upset is this is a problem and it makes it into this wacky
 conspiracy and like I said it only gets weird. And when I say it's a problem I
 mean pedophilia is a problem. The story gets even weirder so not only are there
 special forces squads going around kicking down the doors of the local
 ombudsman for the newspaper being like get on the ground get on the ground show
 me your hands. There's another there's another level to it. Sometimes these
 kids that are taken by the Podunk Sheriff of Nebraska they're taken to
 Antarctica and given to draconian reptiles to beat up and get even more
 molested. So apparently in Antarctica there are... oh and I'm not supposed to
 talk about this either. According to Corey Goode this is not supposed to be
 information that is revealed in any way shape or form even though he reveals it
 on his totally public website and he's still alive and charging $110 if you
 want to watch a webinar with him. Anyways in Antarctica there are these huge
 research and development bases to build these giant spaceships the draconians
 which the reptilians live in. They live... Aunt why Antarctica? Why are lizard
 people in the ice? I don't know. Why aren't they in Brazil which is like equally dense?
 But anyways they're in Antarctica for some reason lizards in the ice because
 those things go so well together and they're building these giant spaceships
 and sometimes they bring kids they ship kids all the way from you know Iowa
 that's where all those missing kids are going they're putting them on planes and
 flying would probably releasing chemtrails as they fly across the globe
 to land in Antarctica to be disembarked and then aliens beat them up and make
 them slaves I don't know. I like to think at some point the special forces are
 going to be here and they're gonna say if you want to kill a serpent cut off its
 head and then they like go to Antarctica and assault these huge bases but I mean
 it's not going to because it's all made up you know I just it boggles my mind
 sometimes like I can get when someone who has a blog and they write something
 completely ridiculous and you're like okay you know whatever when someone has
 an entire organization dedicated to spreading arguably false ideas it's
 just mind-boggling and to end the cap this I think that's that's the same way
 I look at Alex Jones I think he's just an entertainer I think this core good
 guy is an entertainer I don't think he was ever captured by the US Air Force I
 don't think he ever had telepathic visions from an alien I don't think that
 there's top-secret kill squads moving through the United States shooting
 pedophiles I think that there are if hard-working investigators shutting down
 pedophile rings constantly and more pop-up and I think the government this
 government is doing a good-faith effort in shutting down human trafficking I do
 think those things are true and those are interesting stories don't add
 reptilians into it just tell me I think the story itself that we've had massive
 human trafficking arrests in the past year and we're making a good-faith effort
 and we're changing the laws that if you are involved in this we are going to
 hurt you legally and financially we will shut you down I think that's
 interesting you don't have to add space aliens into it or hit squads that are
 killing low-level pedophiles and other people like Barry what a Junies like I
 just couldn't stand looking at that son of a bitch one more time like I don't
 know I I think the I think the story of Sandy Hook is interesting in and of
 itself it's tragic you don't have to add this conspiracy stuff to it I just
 think that this idea that the world is not already completely messed up and
 has a bunch of evil in it and I have to add space aliens and telepathy and
 starships and stargates and all of that stuff I think it's just a little I I
 think it's disingenuous because I honestly think that if Corey Good wrote
 a book about America has a pedophile problem here are the stats here are some
 witness accounts here are some victim accounts here's a couple of words from
 the perpetrators and you know why they did it or how they feel now here's some
 you know we'll talk to these investigators that book is not going to
 sell as well as book after book after book of aliens are in my brain and
 they're eating your children you're not going to be able to pay a hundred and
 ten dollars for a webinar with Corey Good talking about real-life events so he
 just makes stuff up and I think that's the trap that Alex Jones fell into I
 think he probably did honestly believe that 9/11 was an inside job and as time
 progressed the theories got even weirder and weirder and eventually it catches up
 with you because you're stopped being a journalist and you start becoming an
 entertainer and you become a caricature of yourself so yeah I mean I think that
 is the same thing with what happened with Alex Jones I think that it's easier
 to sell a fantastic story you may believe in it at first or you may not but
 what happens is it starts to sell very well if I start doing videos let's say
 I do a video series where I talk about how cryptids are invading the national
 parks and those videos and those podcasts get download multiple multiple times my
 first inclination is going to make more of those and eventually as content starts
 to dry up I'm gonna start making it up because that's how I make money I don't
 make any money off the show but you get where I'm coming from you start off with
 a conspiracy that you genuinely believe in and people respond to it you make
 money and you get used to that money and you got to start making more money I
 don't think I personally again don't know much about Alex Jones other than what
 I've read I don't he doesn't cross me from what I read back in the day
 especially he doesn't cross me someone who's genuinely a racist person or a
 homophobic person but if during the time when people were talking a lot about the
 invasion of Europe and refugees and all of that coming in the West he starts
 making more videos because he's getting more views because he's supporting that
 viewpoint and eventually he just started saying stuff that maybe he didn't even
 believe in but it was getting him views I don't think Corey Good actually believes
 reptiles are living in Antarctica I mean if he does I guess more power to him
 but that's nutty and my question is if he's revealing this information that's
 never supposed to be revealed why was I able to find his website on Google which
 is controlled as we all know by the pedophile draconian Illuminati Alliance
 dead rabbit radio gmail.com is going to be our email address facebook.com/dead
 rabbit radio is our Facebook. Twitter is @jasonocarpenter that's gonna be our
 Twitter so I think we had some really good stories this week I really enjoyed
 them I do have to say something real quick before I officially in the show
 the Circleville writer man you might think like I was doing some coke during
 that but I was actually really excited about that story I had just found out
 about that story maybe an hour before I recorded it as I was thinking about it
 I was like man I sounded super excited during that so hopefully it came off less
 as crank using and more like genuinely enthusiastic because I love a good
 mystery I love a good mystery dead rabbit radio is the daily paranormal
 conspiracy and true crime podcast you don't have to listen to it every day but
 I'm glad you listened to it today have a great one guys
