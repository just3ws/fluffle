1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 fast food, it's all around us. Everyone loves it, it's super nutritious, and it's

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,800
 good for you, it helps your bones grow. But did you know that there are actually

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,560
 several conspiracy theories surrounding fast food? First off, we're gonna find out

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,960
 what's really in a McDonald's hamburger. Secondly, that might not be true, but we'll

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,920
 get another story about something that's in a McDonald's hamburger, and then we

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,800
 will take a look at probably one of the grossest conspiracy theories out there,

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,680
 involving food. And this one has a surprise twist ending today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:47,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,680
 Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Now,

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,920
 one of two things are going on. One, if you're watching on YouTube, you actually see me in

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,640
 the middle of a city right above the cafe square, and a guy in a business suit is

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,160
 riding by on a skateboard. I'm going to try to do video, but don't worry, loyal

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,080
 podcast listeners. I'm not gonna be doing a bunch of episodes where I'm like, "Hey,

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,560
 let's watch this clip," or "Hey, let's do that," so because I hate that when I listen

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120
 to podcasts, when I have to use another alternative method. However, if you do use

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,800
 YouTube, now you see me and the guy in the business suit on the skateboard. Let's go

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,440
 ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Bonkelman. Everyone give a

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,480
 round of applause to Bonkelman. He comes walking in, he has a little like, "Soon on,

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,960
 he's right in an skateboard." Awesome, Bonkelman. You're gonna be our captain, our

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,800
 pilot this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,920
 get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. So, Bonkelman, just

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,560
 yesterday we were at a top secret McDonald's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,000
 We were never able to wrap up that mystery, but while I was looking into that, I found

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,120
 all these other fast food conspiracy theories that I wanted to talk about today. Originally,

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,360
 originally I was gonna do a whole week of these, but today we're just hanging out.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,600
 We're just hanging out on the couch. Bonkelman walks in, everyone's like, "What's up?"

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,920
 And he has the keys to the Jason Jalopy. He's gonna take us for a drive. We're

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
 going to McDonald's. A lot of McDonald's, a lot of McDonald's stories, and they're

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,880
 all bad. So strap in if you own Stock McDonald's or if you like eating there,

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,680
 because these stories get gross. Bonkelman, I want you to drive us all the way out to

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,360
 the deep south. Bonkelman's driving us out to Atlanta, Georgia. And as we're headed

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,520
 out to Atlanta, go ahead and hit that time travel button. We are headed out to the

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,640
 year 1978. We're driving through Atlanta, Georgia. We see people out on the street

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
 corners. That's normal. People are allowed to walk. People are allowed to leave their

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,000
 homes. Back then, at least. It's Atlanta, Georgia. We see people on street corners.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,360
 They're holding signs. Down with McDonald's. Down with McDonald's. They're

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,480
 chanting. We're like, "What? We're driving through the neighborhood." "Boom! McDonald's

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,080
 sucks." We're like, "Huh?" I mean, it's not the best fast food, but I definitely want to

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,760
 say it sucks. It's a couple levels above Arby's, at least. And then we see a guy.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,400
 He has like a little like chain, right? We're ever thrown on him, right? He's like

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,640
 an environmentalist guy, but his chain's not around. That's what environmentalists

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,120
 they just walk around covered in chains. They're all Jacob Marley. You know how

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,240
 environmentalists will chain themselves to trees? Well, this guy is

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,800
 chained to the earth. He's chained to the dirt. And he's like, "McDonald's ain't

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,480
 getting none of this dirt." We're like, "What? Why do they want the dirt?" And he's

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,800
 like, "Oh, you don't know?" We're like, "No, we don't know." And he's grabbing handfuls of

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,640
 mud. We're starting to think it just might be his fetish. He doesn't care anything

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,200
 about the environment. He's like, "I just live laying in mud and being chained up."

49
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,480
 He's playing with mud and he goes, "This mud contains the ingredient, the main

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,240
 ingredient in McDonald's hamburgers." He's like, "Okay, maybe not the mud itself.

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,720
 Maybe I'm going too far with this setup." But he reaches in the mud and he pulls

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,120
 out a big handful of earthworms and they're squirmy. They're all like gross

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
 and bloated and stuff. He's holding them right in front of our face like an

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
 old-timey 3D movie. He's like, "Ah, this is what they put in McDonald's hamburgers."

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,800
 And he's holding the worms out in front of us. This is a really interesting

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,640
 conspiracy theory because this is one where we have dates and times for how

57
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,520
 this story started, which is really rare. Like, people still can't decide on the

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,600
 origins of Bloody Mary. There's a lot of people can't really decide on the origin

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,760
 of the white lady who gets in your car because she died during prom and she's

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,800
 hoping to get home or something like that. I always thought that one was kind of

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,640
 lame. But you know what I mean? Like, we have these old urban legends, little kids,

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,680
 little kids push your car. That's just when you have a lot of kids and your

63
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,920
 car breaks down. That's where that urban legend started. Some lazy dad was like,

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,760
 "Billy, Johnny, get out and start pushing this car." But you know what I mean? We have

65
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,720
 all these urban legends. It's rare when we can figure out where they started from.

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,400
 This one started on August 15th, 1978. I got most of this information from

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,720
 Snopes. They were able to really track this back to get the story. August 15th,

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,360
 1978, Wendy's. Wendy herself gets a phone call and someone goes, "Hey, one of my

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,640
 neighbors said that your food has worms in it." Wendy's looks side to side. She's like,

70
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,160
 "Uh-oh." They found out. She's like, "No, no, no." That's not true. So that was to the end of the phone call.

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,040
 So basically, Wendy's first in August of 1978 started to have this rumor spread

72
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,840
 about them that worm meat was used to fill out the burgers. Nowadays, someone

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,880
 tweets something and it's like either a big thing or doesn't catch off. It

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,440
 depends what the bots want, right? There's really no humans left on Twitter.

75
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,560
 It depends on what the bots want to push. But someone can make a legit complaint

76
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,200
 and it never gets any traction. And someone makes some sort of claim that

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,960
 Wendy's burgers are made of worms and what the bots decide will be popular is

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,360
 what's popular. But they used to not be that. There used to be a time where you

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,160
 could, I guess you could still do it today. Phone still exists, but before

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 Twitter, where am I going with this? The point is, is that back in the good old days,

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,240
 you could make a phone call to Wendy's corporate and within a couple weeks,

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,360
 Wendy's had to put out a press conference. They had to come before the

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,680
 people of the South. This was just a regional thing, but it was catching fire.

84
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,040
 Wendy's by September 15th, so a month later, held a public press conference to

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,000
 say there are no worms in our burgers. And people are like, "Uh-huh, okay."

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,360
 That's all we just want to know, Wendy's was a real person and she showed up. So,

87
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,600
 that was kind of the end of it. But of course, I'm talking about McDonald's

88
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,120
 conspiracy theories because very shortly afterwards, the conspiracy theory

89
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,720
 changed. Now it was worms in McDonald's burgers. I assume the story shifted

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,960
 because a Wendy's shaped silhouette was walking out of the, walking out of like

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,320
 an alleyway one day and reporters walking on the street, meaning "pspsps" come here.

92
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,560
 You know that thing about worms in my food? I mean worms in Wendy's food? That was

93
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,240
 lie. It's all about McDonald's. So anyways, the rumor starts with McDonald's now.

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,080
 So for whatever reason, McDonald's got hit even harder by this thing. Part of it

95
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,960
 could be that, so at September 15th, was when Wendy's disputed it a month later.

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,080
 It quickly switched to McDonald's. It took them until November 23rd to

97
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,200
 address it. But the people at McDonald's were kind of scratching their heads.

98
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,280
 They're like, "This doesn't make sense. We don't have worms in our burgers." And

99
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,960
 what's funny is that there, Wendy's was basically just like, "No, we don't have

100
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,160
 worms in our burgers. That's the end of it." Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, I

101
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,080
 know he bought the company from two other guys, but Ray Kroc is kind of the guy

102
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,320
 who made it into the juggernaut it is today. When he found out about this rumor,

103
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,800
 he actually addressed the rumor himself, because reporters are asking about it. He

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,440
 goes, "No, and I'll tell you why we don't have worms in our meat. Worm meat is very

105
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,360
 expensive." He said, "We get slabs of meat so cheap." He goes, "Worms actually cost

106
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,680
 the more." They're, I guess, harder to catch. I guess you need to be six years old

107
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,120
 and have a little shovel. You have to wait for a rainy day. Imagine if you had a

108
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,480
 wait for a rainy day to slaughter all those cows. They're harder to catch.

109
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,520
 They're more expensive to process. You have competition. People are trying to

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,720
 buy them for bait or that suspicious bird-shaped shop sitting on the edge of

111
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,840
 town and there's a bird wearing a giant trench coat. He's like, "I have more worms

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,080
 for me." But anyways, the McDonald's got hit really hard. You had some

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,920
 franchisees of McDonald's lose up to 30% of their business due to this

114
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,000
 rumor. Because who wants to eat a worm burger? I'll answer that in a second, but

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,880
 who really wants to eat a worm burger? You're not. Most people would answer no.

116
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,440
 It spread out of Atlanta. It started to get into Ohio. This rumor was getting

117
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,840
 really, really popular back then. Eventually, on November 23rd, they held a

118
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,120
 press conference. They said, "We don't have worm meat. Rake croc runs on stage."

119
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,480
 He's like, "You know how expensive worms are?" I looked into it. I was gonna make

120
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,520
 worm burgers, but I couldn't. They're like pushing them off stage. They're like,

121
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,880
 "Dude, you're not healthy." He's like, "What? What?" I mean, they look tasty, right?

122
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,960
 He's a bird. He's a bird in a trench coat. Rake, squawk. So anyways, the rumor

123
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,560
 dies down. And then, like, I don't know, a couple weeks later, a month later, a new

124
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,920
 rumor starts. You see, McDonald's hamburgers, McDonald's hamburgers have to

125
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
 have meat in them. But what is meat? People are asking each other on the street.

126
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
 They're like, "Literally, I don't know what's meat. I've been eating clay this

127
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,960
 whole time." 100% beef is how they list their hamburgers. These rumor mongers

128
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,920
 were saying, "If you took cow eyeballs, it's out of a cow, right? Everything that

129
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,320
 is... everything comes out of a cow's beef that swallows a tungsten rod. It's beef

130
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,520
 now. It's all beef. So they're taking cow eyeballs and squishing them up. I told

131
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,600
 you this is gonna be... you're eating a big mac right now. You're like, "I can do the

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,280
 worms." But this is gross. They're taking out cow eyeballs and squishing them up.

133
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:24,080
 And McDonald's again disputed this one, and they go, "No joke. This was their

134
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,480
 answer for this." Do you know how expensive eyeballs are? They said eyeballs are one

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,280
 of the most expensive parts of a cow. Because McDonald's is buying their beef,

136
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,160
 but the eyeballs are being sent to research laboratories. You can get, what,

137
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,320
 50 pounds of beef, but each cow, no matter how big or small they are, they only got

138
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,360
 two eyeballs. So those are very, very valuable to research people. And then

139
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,360
 they're squishing them. They're turning them into mayonnaise. They're like, "Mmm, so

140
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
 delicious on my McDonald's hamburger." So there's your visual. There's your

141
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,320
 mayonnaise visual for the day. Then... I'm not just gonna list off conspiracy theories,

142
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,800
 but I thought these three were the funniest. And then we'll get into some

143
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,600
 creepy ones. And then people started saying, "Okay, okay. Are eyeball plans in

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,280
 the world? Do you have a laboratory?" Wendy's is there, and Jack and the janitor

145
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,800
 from Arby's, that's their highest rank and associate, and Colonel Sanders is there,

146
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,840
 and they're like, "Dang it. McDonald's is impervious to our lives." So they didn't

147
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,760
 believe the eyeball thing. Arby's is right down the stuff. He's like, "Mmm, eyeballs in

148
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,720
 my sandwiches. That'll make them taste even better." So one more rumor started

149
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,280
 up about McDonald's. They do say that they come from a hundred percent beef. This

150
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,160
 one's actually kind of clever. Someone really had it out for McDonald's, maybe

151
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,800
 because they were the cock of the block. They were the big boys. But they said that...

152
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,920
 Oh, so it said 100% beef. 100% beef on these burgers. They were saying, the

153
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,040
 conspiracy started, that they weren't 100% beef. They were worms and eyeballs and

154
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,920
 all sorts of tungsten rods, all sorts of stuff. That McDonald's was actually

155
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 buying their meat from a company called 100% beef. So they could say, "Our

156
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,560
 burgers are 100% beef." And it would be true. And McDonald's is like, "That's

157
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,880
 that one. It's a little clever, but it's not true. We actually have all of our

158
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,320
 stuff graded and everything. It might be D's and C's, but it's a grade, baby." So

159
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,120
 anyways, all those conspiracy theories popped up all relatively around the same

160
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,160
 time. But then you have the creepier ones.

161
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,480
 Bunkleman, let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Jett. We're gonna leave behind

162
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,600
 Atlanta, Georgia. We are headed out to a research facility in the middle of Brazil.

163
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,960
 Bunkleman lands his jet in the middle of the rainforest. We're walking around.

164
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,000
 We're hacking it with our machetes. Chop, chop, chop. We're sending stuff on fire to

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,480
 make it super easy. Oh, my arms cramp. And I just burn a path. Burnin' it up. We

166
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,720
 find a secret facility in the middle of the Amazon jungle. It's not super

167
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,320
 secret because there's a giant golden arches on the top of the building. And

168
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,360
 they have a sign outside that says, "Over 60 billion dissected." And we're like,

169
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,520
 "Huh?" And so we have key codes. We beat up some dudes. We took their key cards. They

170
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,160
 didn't even work there. We just wanted to beat them up. Then we had to beat up

171
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,780
 some other guys. We take their key cards. We're able to access this secret

172
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,920
 Brazilian facility. This story popped up. It was super popular in March of 2000,

173
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,760
 which again is an interesting one we can find. I guess nowadays because so many

174
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,040
 rumors are spread electronically, we probably could track it back easier.

175
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,080
 This one I actually found on a website that I stumbled across. I was

176
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,520
 researching something else. There is a Portuguese website. So it's a Brazilian

177
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,200
 website, but it's in Portuguese. It's called Quatro Cantos, which means four

178
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,160
 corners. It's all about internet legends and conspiracy theories. And it's, there's

179
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,560
 super bizarre stuff on there. In March 2000, this conspiracy goes around. It was

180
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,320
 really popular in Brazil. That there is a secret research facility somewhere in

181
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,680
 the world. And inside it are the cows that McDonald's gets its beef from. It's not

182
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,480
 fair to say that they're cows. It'd be better to say that they were cows at

183
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
 some point. It's a real philosophical question. When does a cow stop being a

184
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,600
 cow? So we walk into this research facility and we see this abomination just

185
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:39,680
 laying there. It has no limbs. So it's just a big old torso laying on a table. But

186
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,880
 you can tell from the way it's undulating that it's alive. Actually, the other thing

187
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,240
 about it would kind of look like a worm. Kind of look like a bill grub. It's kind

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,600
 of just has no bones. Bones just get in the way of that delicious meat. Instead,

189
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,920
 it just has cartilage to keep it. What do bones do? Bones keep the body together,

190
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,480
 right? It's not like the super glue, but you know what I mean? Like, if I didn't

191
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 have bones, well, here's the thing. If I didn't have bones in my arms, my arms

192
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,360
 wouldn't work. But if I didn't have arms, I wouldn't worry about it. So my question

193
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,440
 is, like the rib cage, if you got rid of the rib cage, if you took me and turned

194
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,360
 me into a legless, armless, genetically modified monster, and would I need a

195
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,960
 rib cage? I think you would only need a spine. But like, why don't you just get

196
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,880
 rid of all of it? I guess scientists know. I mean, I don't know. Maybe scientists

197
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,040
 know all this stuff. But they're like, Jason, of course, you need to have cartilage

198
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,960
 in your cow monster. It doesn't have any bones. It just has underdeveloped cartilage.

199
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,360
 It has no eyes, no tail, no fur, so it's just as big as a worm. It's a giant worm.

200
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:57,280
 And its head is the size of a baseball. So a tiny little head has no eyes. It

201
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,000
 doesn't say anything about not having a mouth, but they do just lead tubes into

202
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,720
 its stomach, and they pump food into it, and that's what keeps it growing. It's like a

203
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,160
 balloon, like an organic balloon. And then eventually they slaughter it. So

204
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,160
 that's gross, right? Like, if you... it's one thing, like, the way that we treat

205
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,660
 animals for industrial slaughter, it's pretty... it's barbaric. I'm not gonna

206
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,080
 sugarcoat it. It's barbaric. I was a vegetarian for quite a few years because

207
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,240
 of that. It just got too expensive. Like, at a certain point I was like, well, I do

208
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,840
 not like supporting the industrial slaughter of animals, but at the same time I

209
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,960
 need to eat. Otherwise, I will starve to death. So I ended up switching. Now I eat

210
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,880
 canned raviolis and stuff like that. So it sucks. Like, I totally get it.

211
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,440
 There's... it's... I understand why they do it, because it's industrialized and

212
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,520
 stuff like that, but that's... it's still pretty barbaric. I watched that

213
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,800
 documentary once about that girl who had autism, and she always had a hide-and-

214
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,480
 under-a-blink it. And then there's one of those movie synopses that I, like, barely

215
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,640
 remember the movie. Like, what are you talking about? Her name was like Angus

216
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,600
 Truman, or Truman... I don't know. Truman Angus. She was named after what she loved

217
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,920
 the most, eating cows. She actually... she had suffered from autism, so she carried

218
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,320
 around this giant blanket everywhere and had to hang out in this box that, like,

219
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,520
 squished her. It's a saw movie. Ah, I'm getting them confused. No, she had, like,

220
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,280
 this box that was all cushioned. And she loved cutting animals up. She loved the

221
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,520
 slaughterhouse. That was her favorite job. But what happened was she would go to

222
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,120
 these... she would... that was what she was getting her degree in, and she would go to

223
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,680
 the slaughterhouse, and she... see the cows, like, totally freaking out and getting

224
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,920
 slaughtered. And she's watching this, and she goes, "There's a better way to kill

225
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,240
 these cows." She wasn't, like, the super environment... I'm sure she cares about the

226
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,080
 environment on some level. I'm not saying she's, like, peeing on the ground. Take that,

227
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,160
 Earth. But she also was like, "I understand, like, I'm in the slaughterhouse of

228
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,560
 business. I know how humans need me. It's really good for them. But there's a

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,880
 better way to kill 100,000 cows a year," was her thing. I'm not saying don't kill

230
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
 the cows. I'm not saying really kill less of them. But we can make them more

231
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,120
 comfortable on their last moments on Earth. So she invented... it's a really

232
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,400
 interesting movie. I wish I could remember the title of it. Angus McDuff. She invented

233
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,440
 this thing where the... can I at least look up her name if you're gonna tell us this

234
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,760
 intriguing story. She set up a slaughterhouse that the cows would get

235
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,720
 hugged as they walked through the slaughterhouse. So it's not like there

236
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,640
 would be workers going like, "Oh, like, rubbing and scratching their belly." It was

237
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,680
 the way that the slaughterhouse was built was before the cows... before the cows

238
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,360
 were basically just like, "It's time to die!" and a guy would chase them around with

239
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,600
 the chainsaw or something. It wasn't that bad, but they'd like shoot them in the

240
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,400
 back of the head and the cows would be freaking out. They could smell the death.

241
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,800
 They could smell the cow poop. They could smell all this horror going on in front

242
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,360
 of them and they're being herded in to this building where you can... there's so

243
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,080
 much blood you can smell the iron oxide in the air. She says, "We're gonna kill them."

244
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,440
 But what if we build like little huggy things for them so they're walking

245
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,040
 through and the sides are like comforting them as they go. Playing lullaby music.

246
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,160
 Aww. And she actually got the... she got like some rich investor to build one of

247
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 these. I think there's a couple of them now. She actually did go about changing a

248
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,000
 lot of things of how people were slaughtering animals. I always thought it

249
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,360
 was an interesting story. Not so interesting that I would look up the

250
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,480
 title for you. I'll put it in the show notes. I'll look it up later. But that is

251
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,240
 the story of the slaughterhouse woman. But where are we going with this? Oh yeah!

252
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,360
 So anyways, you have cows being horribly butchered and so you could see

253
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,200
 someone going, "Listen, what if we can remove that horror element from the

254
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,560
 cow's life by not killing cows?" Or basically like, "No, they're not a

255
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,280
 cow. They're a genetically modified tiny little brain organism. They would

256
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,040
 basically have the personality of an amoeba. They would just sit on a table

257
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,480
 and we feed them food and they plump up and then we chop them up." And you can

258
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,640
 imagine other CEOs looking at the scientists and being like, "That is

259
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,600
 brilliant, my friend. That's horrifying but brilliant." That's not all though,

260
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,040
 because also going around in this same email, it's not just that you're eating

261
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,520
 disgusting genetically modified cow guts with no bones. You're like, "Oh, that's my

262
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,360
 favorite part." Eating this gives you AIDS. So that should be the deal breaker,

263
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,320
 right? We could have moral questions all day long about whether or not to

264
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,560
 eat this cow mutant, but it gives you AIDS and Alzheimer's, which is a terrible

265
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,440
 combination of stuff. So basically what this theory says, not only does McDonald's

266
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,920
 treat cows so horribly they've created a cow monster to get meat from, really the

267
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:07,240
 bullet point here is eating McDonald's gives you AIDS. That's really the thesis.

268
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,120
 That should have been the first sentence, because other people could have been like,

269
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,000
 "Oh, you know, maybe cows don't need AIDS. Maybe those are overrated for cows."

270
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,800
 Just start it off, eating McDonald's gives you AIDS and then you go, "Gentlemen, now

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,760
 that I have your attention, read the rest of this email." But Bonkelman, let's go

272
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,520
 ahead and hop in that carbonar copter. This episode might run a little bit long,

273
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,600
 but I do want to cover this one. Bonkelman, call in that carbonar copter. We

274
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,200
 are leaving behind the Brazilian rain... Previously was the rain force. Now it's

275
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,480
 a beautiful clearing where you can build all sorts of stuff. We are leaving

276
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,400
 behind the Brazilian parking lot and we are headed out to the Netherlands.

277
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 [Demonic mumbling]

278
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
 Flying over. We see a little research facility, a lot of research facilities in

279
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,720
 this show. So we land at this research facility and we see a big sign on it and

280
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,520
 it says, "Research facility keep out" and then underneath it says, "A division of

281
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,880
 PepsiCo." We're like, "Oh, that's kind of weird." So we're walking around and we see

282
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,440
 a bunch of protesters outside this research facility and they're like, "Burn it

283
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
 down. Burn it down. Burn it down." We're like, "What's going on?" And they go, "Guys,

284
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,080
 listen, you will not believe this." Inside that facility, they are using human

285
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,560
 fetal tissue and putting it inside Pepsi. You know that boy we're both drinking

286
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,240
 Pepsi's were upset. What'd you say? They go, "Yes, human fetal tissue is used to

287
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:41,120
 flavor Pepsi sodas." This one is so weird because I'm telling you, because I'm

288
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,560
 telling you the reaction that you're having right now is the same reaction I

289
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:54,360
 had. 100%. Let's get into this. People have been protesting boycotting, really,

290
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,960
 boycotting Pepsi over this. This controversy broke out in 2011 when a

291
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,520
 website called naturalnews.com, which is exactly what it sounds like. It's a

292
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,440
 website that does a lot of holistic stuff, fringe science stuff. They said Pepsi is

293
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:21,040
 using a line of fetal tissue called HEK293 to flavor their sodas. HEK293 is a

294
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,680
 group of cells that were taken out of a embryos kidney, embryonic kidney. They're

295
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,760
 actually from a child who was aborted back in the 1970s in

296
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,680
 Netherlands. That's what they use with some fetal tissue. They'll use it for

297
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,880
 scientific purposes, stem cells, things like that. So HEK293, this is the

298
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,120
 story that was put forth. HEK293 was a clump of kidney, kidney, embryonic kidney

299
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,120
 cells that were then sold to these research laboratories and they were

300
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,120
 using it as an additive in the flavor of the Pepsi's. And so this started to take

301
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,840
 off, this rumor started to take off really back in 2011 when this article was

302
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,240
 ran. People started looking into it, people started calling up Pepsi, people

303
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,280
 started boycotting Pepsi, and supposedly this company in the Netherlands, known as

304
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,920
 CenoMix, was the one who was doing this research for Pepsi. So think about

305
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,960
 everything we've talked about. We've talked about worms in hamburgers, we've

306
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
 talked about eyeballs in hamburgers, McDonald's has had a rough go, we talked

307
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,680
 about that AIDS cow that basically you McDonald's you get AIDS. We get to this

308
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,640
 story in 2011, some things never change, right? What's interesting about this story

309
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,560
 is in 2012 Pepsi came forward and said, you know what, we know you're boycotting

310
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,720
 this because you guys say that we're working with CenoMix and they're using

311
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,760
 fetal tissue to work with our drinks. We as of now are going to stop our

312
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,160
 partnership with CenoMix, please call the boycott off. It was true, in a sense, in

313
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,520
 a sense it was true. So the story was that fetal tissue was being used as a

314
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,960
 flavor additive. What the truth was, was that fetal tissue was involved, that

315
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,120
 was not an exaggeration, it wasn't being added to each can of Pepsi. They were

316
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,080
 using it to taste thousands of flavors a day. Look at this quote here, this is from

317
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,360
 Forbes. A tiny company called CenoMix has been working to use this new

318
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,240
 technology to create food additives. CenoMix has isolated receptors found on

319
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,920
 cells that detect taste and added them to the HEK cells. This allows them to test

320
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,400
 thousands of potential taste additives to see whether they may taste sweet or

321
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,800
 savory with a speed that would be impossible with human taste testers.

322
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,720
 CenoMix has announced collaborations with Pepsi, Nestle, and Coca-Cola. So they

323
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,520
 weren't using it, they weren't like dripping it in with an IV into the Coke

324
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,000
 batch. They were using it to create the flavors in the first place. They could

325
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,360
 just run diet, I'm sure nowadays you could do a lot of that stuff computer-wise.

326
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,080
 I think computers like "bwack, bwack, bwack" face a gross face and they're like

327
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,440
 "get rid of that line or sell it to Arby's." It can taste thousands of

328
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,400
 different combinations faster than a human can. So they actually were using

329
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,160
 this. I find that fascinating. It's gross, it's totally gross, but I also find it

330
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,200
 fascinating because this is the one conspiracy theory of this, that it was

331
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,600
 off the mark. They weren't actually using it as a flavor additive, but they were

332
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,360
 using it to design their flavors in the first place. So that is the story of, or

333
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,600
 multiple stories, of fast food conspiracy theories. I think it's really

334
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,400
 fascinating. Oh, and to its credit, Pepsi said, because again, they really came

335
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,000
 clean on this. They could have just said, "No, it's not true, it's not true." They

336
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 said, "Listen, the Pepsi that you are drinking right now at the press conference

337
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,160
 that does not have fetal tissue in it, fetal tissue never ever touched that

338
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:02,080
 drink. We use it to design flavors, but it's not actually in the drink." So it's

339
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,600
 again, the story evolved to be extra gross, but I think it's fascinating to see

340
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 the evolution of conspiracy theories, to see how long they stick around. When I

341
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,560
 read that, I read it on some wacky website where they said, "You know that

342
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,680
 Pepsi uses fetal tissue?" And I was like, "Well, that's dumb." And I started looking

343
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,080
 into it because that's what I do, even if I think something's dumb, I'll actually

344
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,520
 study it to see if I'm right and to see and kind of dissect it. Because I love

345
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,560
 how these things work, whether or not I believe in them or moot. I don't believe

346
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,120
 in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but I'll watch two hours of that show a day

347
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,000
 because I enjoy the story and everything like that. But so I looked

348
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,840
 into this and Pepsi was like, "Yeah, kind of." And they ended their contract with

349
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,400
 them and stuff like that. But I find that very, very fascinating. And I think we're

350
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,040
 about to get a whole new bunch of conspiracy theories out there, guys. I

351
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,960
 think that with everything going on in the United States, you have like the

352
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,440
 election and then you have the votes getting disputed and you're gonna have

353
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,760
 these lawsuits and you're gonna have... Strap in, guys, because this next... I

354
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,280
 predict... I don't think there's gonna be a Civil War. I think that's the... whatever.

355
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,440
 But I don't not even think we're close to that. But I think the next five years is

356
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,920
 going to be... it's going to be the golden age of conspiracy theories. We're gonna

357
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,400
 see both sides... we're not both sides. We're gonna see every single side issuing

358
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,000
 conspiracy theories about other people. Some will grow. Organically, some will be

359
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,280
 boosted by the bots of Twitter. Some will die off. The real question is, will we be

360
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:43,480
 able to talk about them? Will things get so gummed up by algorithms that if you

361
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,440
 talk about this conspiracy theory, you talk about that conspiracy theory, they

362
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,280
 take it down. I actually got hit with a hate crime strike on one of my episodes

363
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,080
 recently. It was... you can check it out. There's nothing in it that was even

364
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,560
 close to that. It was the episode about the woman magically disappearing in

365
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,840
 Paris. So the lady vanishes. It was episode like 550, 553 or something like that.

366
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,920
 Got hit with a hate crime strike against my YouTube channel. There's nothing in

367
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,600
 that episode that even comes close to that. Or any of my episodes really for

368
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,520
 that matter. They're coming down hard on conspiracy content. And I think the

369
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,760
 conspiracy content is going to grow and the hammer is going to keep striking

370
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,960
 down. There was a time where Pepsi or McDonald's would just come out and go

371
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,680
 "That's not true!" and everyone would go "Yeah, that was kind of dumb. Eyeballs do

372
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,840
 cost a lot." And everyone goes home. We're entering an age where even saying

373
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,120
 something like that could get your Twitter account banned. So golden age of

374
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,280
 conspiracy theories is coming up. Will we be allowed to talk about them? Who knows?

375
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,360
 I just figured that's food for thought. As I'm pointing at the camera, that's the

376
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,560
 only... those are the only jokes. That's the only joke that you won't get if... well

377
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,320
 you got the joke anyways, but I'm pointing at the camera. Dead Rapper Radio at
