1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 Warning, the episode you're about to hear may cover stories that involve curses that

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,740
 can be transmitted just by hearing the story.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,680
 Listener discretion is advised.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:19,520
 A local coffee shop in Hood River may actually be the site of a stinky haunting.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,880
 And then we often take a look at stories of witnesses who peer beyond the veil who see

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,520
 something completely unexplainable, horrific or bizarre.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:38,200
 But what happens when the witness, the storyteller, is actually the cursed item itself.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:51,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,720
 I hope you guys had a really fun weekend.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,840
 This is the last week of season 17, so we got these 5 episodes and I take a 2 week break

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,360
 and I'll be back after I catch a leprechaun and earn all the gold in the world and a couple

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
 wishes as well.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,600
 I'll be back in a golden robe recording more Dead Rabbit Radio for you.

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
 What week will that be?

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 Let me take a look here.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,360
 So, I will be back, let's say on April 5th.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,240
 April 5th is when Dead Rabbit Radio will recommence.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,560
 But that is in the future.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,480
 Let us look at the now and right now coming into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our Christmas

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
 livestream supporters.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,400
 We've finally got through all the Thanksgiving ones.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,600
 Give it up for Nephilim Operation Wrinkled.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 Woo!

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 Come on in.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
 There's the thing.

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 No one's walking in.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 Here's the thing.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,160
 I don't know if that's actually their name.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,520
 I don't know if there was a YouTube user by the name of Nephilim who wanted me to do a

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,200
 story on something called Operation Wrinkled.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,760
 Or if their name is actually Nephilim Operation Wrinkled, whoever you are, thank you for supporting

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
 the show financially.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,240
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,920
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,600
 Just help spread the word about the show.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,960
 That really, really helps out a lot.

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
 Now, Little Wrinkly, Little Wrinkled dude.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Delopi.

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,240
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,440
 We're just driving a few blocks away to a local unnamed coffee shop here in Hood River.

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,360
 And you go, Jason, wait, you're not naming this coffee shop.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
 You figure this would be good publicity for him.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,320
 Would be if I was just going to talk about how yummy the coffee was or how good the customer

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
 service was.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,120
 I don't know how to make heads or tails of this story.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,600
 This one's really, really weird.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,400
 It just happened to me yesterday.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,440
 So I go to this coffee shop, this unnamed coffee shop, and there's this table that this

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
 dude always sits at.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,880
 I'm not going to name the guy either.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,760
 But there's this table that this dude will call him Jesse.

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,200
 We'll say his name is Jesse, but it's not.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 Jesse always sits at this table.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
 He sits at this table all the time.

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,040
 Same table every day at this coffee shop.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
 Now here's the thing.

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 I don't have a problem with Jesse.

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,320
 I do not have a problem with Jesse.

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,640
 I've never really had a problem with Jesse.

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,520
 I've interacted with him a lot over the years.

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,760
 Never had a problem with him.

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,440
 But I personally know of a lot of women who don't like this dude.

66
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,840
 And not like they don't like it, because I always go, I find it so interesting, I go,

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 "Why don't you like Jesse?"

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
 The answer is always the same.

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 I don't know.

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
 I don't know why I don't like him.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 But I don't like him.

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,280
 It's not like his personality.

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,680
 It's something about him that is super off-putting.

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,560
 Again, Jesse, if you're listening to this and you know who you are, there's a guy named

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
 Jesse right now crying.

76
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
 He's like, "Oh, I hate coffee.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 I don't even know what I'm being talked about."

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,880
 I know a lot of women who just don't like this guy.

79
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
 They just don't want to be around this dude.

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,160
 I don't have a problem with him.

81
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,320
 And so they'll say, "I think it has something to do with women."

82
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 But I go, "You think he's pervert or something?"

83
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,160
 They're like, "I can't put my finger on it.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,200
 First of all, why do you want to keep talking about Jesse?

85
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,600
 I can't put my finger on it, but he's very off-putting."

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,840
 It's the word I hear a lot.

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
 Two, I just don't like the guy.

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
 It goes that far.

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,440
 But then he's married and stuff like that too.

90
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,440
 So it's not like he's this gremlin crawling through the sewers of the city.

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,200
 Anyways, I go and I sat in his chair the other day.

92
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 He wasn't there.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
 It's a nice chair.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 I went and I sat in the chair of this unnamed coffee shop.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 And I don't even know how to place all this stuff together.

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,080
 I'm sitting there, I was doing research for the show during my coffee.

97
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
 And I sat in this chair once before a couple weeks ago.

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,720
 I normally don't sit in the chair because he's normally always there.

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,600
 I sat in this chair and I'm doing research, looking up spooky stuff on my computer.

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,520
 And I don't cuss often in this show, really.

101
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,840
 But if you're listening to this at work because you're like, "Jason never cusses."

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
 He talks about all sorts of idiot stuff.

103
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,720
 I don't know why he thinks it's so impressive that he doesn't cuss when he's talking about

104
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,280
 people voluntarily removing their penises.

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,440
 It's just as bad, Jesse.

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
 It's just, no.

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,160
 No one listens to this show at work.

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 It's such a crap shoot.

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 Well, there is no way for me to explain what happened without using vulgar language.

110
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,000
 I'm sitting there at this chair that Jesse is always at.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
 And again, I have no problem with this dude.

112
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 I'm not saying he cussed.

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
 Actually, I don't know.

114
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,800
 I don't know what I'm saying.

115
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,400
 I'm sitting there in the chair and I'm looking up spooky stuff.

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,800
 And all of a sudden, I'm hit with a smell that could only be described as if you've

117
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:48,160
 ever sat next to a dog and its anus opened up and fresh shit came out of that dog.

118
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
 Like you're right next to it.

119
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
 You're playing on it, right?

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
 This wasn't a fetish.

121
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,840
 You're just sitting there for whatever reason.

122
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,840
 You're sitting on the ground watching television show and this dog just poops.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
 It's not poop.

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
 It was like this fresh, wet smell.

125
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
 And it just magically appeared in this coffee shop.

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
 And I'm sitting there on my computer and all of a sudden, I smelt it and it was wet and

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,440
 warm and disgusting.

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,160
 And I thought there was a dog next to me pooping and I kind of looked around.

129
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
 There's nothing.

130
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,680
 I kind of look around and no one else is smelling it.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
 No one else is sitting near me, right?

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 It's not me.

133
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,160
 I know I didn't poop my pants.

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,040
 And the smell lingered for a couple minutes.

135
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 It was rank.

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 It was so gross.

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,160
 And then it went away.

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,520
 So I'm going to go around taking another drink.

139
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,440
 I'm like, "That made me hungry.

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
 Ten tootsie rolls please."

141
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,680
 I'm sitting there and I'm drinking my coffee and I go back to writing or researching, writing

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,960
 up notes and maybe 15 or 20 minutes pass and the smell hits me again.

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,120
 It's so new.

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
 And when I say new, I mean like the food just got done getting digested.

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,000
 It was organic waste matter and the smell was just filling my nostrils.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And again, I looked.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,240
 I don't know why I thought if I looked at this time I could spot what the source of the

148
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
 smell was.

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,920
 I looked around and I always smelt it coming from the right side of me, which is the wall.

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 Now there was not a dog trapped in the wall.

151
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
 Don't call animal control.

152
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,560
 But there's like a maybe a foot gap between me and the wall.

153
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,800
 There's like this little corner and I'm looking around and I'm thinking what in the world

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,160
 could be causing this hideous smell?

155
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,840
 What happened about every 15 minutes?

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,480
 You would get hit with the smell of fresh excrement.

157
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,640
 And again, not human poop, right?

158
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,080
 Human poop has a totally different smell.

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,080
 This was hot anus fresh shit smell.

160
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,880
 There's the difference.

161
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,400
 If a dude was taking a dump next to me, I wouldn't have smelled this bad.

162
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,920
 Oh, I guess to be fair it depends on the dude, right?

163
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,080
 He's just he's walking in, he's throwing a Taco Bell wrapper in the garbage and he's

164
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,040
 like, oh, and he starts stretching that might not be the best.

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,620
 But I still want it smelled as bad as this.

166
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,360
 And it happened on about every 15 minutes.

167
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,400
 I was there for like an hour and a half.

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,320
 I just tanked it because I had to do this research and they do really make good coffee

169
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 there.

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,440
 My question is this, we talked about this on last week's episode about psychic landmines.

171
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,840
 We talked about, we've talked about it before on the show, people leaving behind the psychic

172
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 residue.

173
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,240
 Jesse, if you listen to the podcast, I like you.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,920
 I don't have a problem with you at all.

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:59,280
 But I'm wondering if this is some sort of psychic time bomb that either A, he left or

176
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,360
 B has latched onto him.

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
 I didn't think about that.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,400
 I thought about that, but I didn't think of the implications of that.

179
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:14,680
 What if he's a mild manner dude, but he got like this poop demon on him and women find

180
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,080
 him super off putting and not all women, but a lot of women find him off putting.

181
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
 I don't know, dude.

182
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
 I hope it hasn't latched onto me.

183
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,600
 I 'cause rationally I'm thinking that I step in poop and I didn't because the smell was

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 so fresh.

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 I did check my shoes.

186
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,920
 Then I started thinking like maybe the coffee shop has some sort of, this is how conspiratorial

187
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,600
 I got because I couldn't figure out what was causing the smell.

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,080
 I thought maybe the coffee shop because they don't like people hanging out in there all

189
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,240
 day long.

190
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,160
 Every show often they'll spray the scent of fresh dog poop onto your table to make you

191
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
 leave.

192
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,280
 And I thought, I'm sure there'd be an easier way to do that.

193
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,800
 I'm sure it'd be easier way for them to walk up and be like, sir, would you like more coffee

194
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
 or we're going to have to ask you to leave?

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,800
 I don't think they would irradiate their store just so people stay longer than 15 minutes.

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 Super weird.

197
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,980
 I think it's a haunting.

198
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,480
 There was no other way.

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
 There was no one sitting around me.

200
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,880
 There was no animals around me.

201
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,280
 Even if you think it was like a leaky pipe going through, everyone shut off the podcast

202
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,280
 and they were just like, I don't even want to hear the other stories because they might

203
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 curse me.

204
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
 And you keep telling this one.

205
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 This isn't the cursed one right?

206
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
 No, it's not.

207
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,520
 Even if there were pipes going through the walls that carried raw human sewage, it wouldn't

208
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,280
 have made that smell.

209
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,960
 And it wouldn't have made that smell on a regular interval.

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,840
 I think there's some sort of spooky smell ghost there.

211
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,720
 Maybe the dog was pooping and had a heart attack right when it was pooping and that

212
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,400
 was like its favorite activity was pooping indoors back in 1803.

213
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,320
 Before the coffee shop was built, there was a hermit shack there.

214
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
 Super weird.

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,480
 I think there is, again, Jesse, I don't have a problem with you, but I'm wondering if there

216
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
 is a connection between his presence being there and the poop smell being there.

217
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,960
 Not that he poops his pants.

218
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,800
 I'm trying to be very, very nice to the guy again.

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,080
 I don't have a problem with him at all.

220
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,640
 I'm sincerely don't have a problem with him.

221
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,880
 But yeah, weird, right?

222
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,240
 Psychic landmine, something that's attached to him.

223
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 I will continue to study this phenomenon.

224
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,160
 We will see how deep the dog anus goes.

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
 That sounded bad.

226
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,280
 Even as a joke, even as a pun.

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,720
 I didn't even like the sound of that.

228
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 But we'll see.

229
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 Like, I'll go back.

230
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,920
 I started live streaming from there.

231
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,880
 I was like, Jason, we obviously know what coffee shop you're at.

232
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,480
 We see the employees in the background with clothespins on their nose.

233
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,080
 And they're all worshiping a giant, like, brown floating hole.

234
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 Never mind.

235
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
 I'm not even going to keep going with those jokes.

236
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,400
 Nephilim, Operation Ring Cold.

237
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,080
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

238
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,840
 Dead Rabbit, Durgible, we're going to leave behind this coffee shop.

239
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,360
 We are headed all the way out to a small house in suburban America.

240
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,920
 Now, here's the thing.

241
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,080
 This is one of those stories where we don't really have a location.

242
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,440
 I'm assuming it's in America just because I'm in America.

243
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,320
 I know where the Durgible can fly here.

244
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,560
 If it goes overseas, I have to pay all sorts of import and export taxes.

245
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,560
 So we're just flying around America and we're going to check out the house of this young

246
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
 woman.

247
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,080
 This story just happened the other day, too.

248
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,800
 This story just happened on March 6, 2022.

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,680
 On line, she goes by a caddy of Flimsy 5338.

250
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,000
 We're going to go ahead and call her Tiffany.

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,760
 That's the real name.

252
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
 Just a guess.

253
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
 Her name's Jessie.

254
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,200
 She's like, "Oh, no, I'm the pooper."

255
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,560
 So Tiffany has a teenage sister, like, 14, 15 years old.

256
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,400
 And the other morning, on March 6, Tiffany's walking around the house and her sister will

257
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,040
 call her Betty, says, "Hey, hey, Tiff.

258
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,000
 What in the world is going on this morning?"

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Tiffany's like, "What are you talking about?"

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And she goes, "Listen, dude, that was so creepy.

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 What happened?

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 What were you doing?

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Like, totally freaked me out."

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,680
 Like, honestly, whatever you were doing was so upsetting, like, I didn't even want to

265
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 move.

266
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,160
 Like, you terrified me like I was a deer in headlights.

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,840
 And Tiffany's like, "I have no idea what you're talking about."

268
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,480
 So just, I don't know.

269
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,080
 I wasn't doing anything spooky.

270
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:22,040
 Betty goes, "Listen, I woke up this morning, it was probably like 6.45 around there.

271
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,440
 Walking through the house and I get to your bedroom and your bedroom door is cracked open

272
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,880
 and I see you staring at me through the crack in the door."

273
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,880
 And I don't know, I don't even know how to explain this, but I immediately felt something

274
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,160
 in my body say, "Don't get any closer."

275
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,240
 And I'm looking at you standing through the crack of the door, like you're staring at

276
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,320
 me.

277
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,040
 And you have this totally blink look on your face and you're not blinking.

278
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,000
 You're staring at me.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,440
 Now Tiffany goes, "I have no idea what you're talking about.

280
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,200
 I wasn't standing all creepy in the door."

281
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,160
 She's taking notes, she's like, "I'm going to do that later.

282
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,440
 On Halloween night, I'll scare everybody."

283
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,400
 So Betty's looking at Tiffany through the door, Tiffany's staring back at her and she's

284
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,920
 not blinking, she just has this blink look on her face.

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:25,480
 And then all of a sudden, you started to jump around.

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,360
 You were jumping almost like side to side, each arm being raised and then lowered and

287
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,680
 your legs were kind of kicking in this weird way.

288
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,640
 And I'm watching you and through the crack in the door, I can see your body.

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,720
 The door's not just a sliver, I can see most of you.

290
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,520
 You're jumping up and down as if you were a marionette puppet, as if someone was pulling

291
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,680
 invisible strings to move each arm and leg.

292
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,000
 Your head would flop from side to side and you just jumped there in front of me for a

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,320
 couple of moments.

294
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,600
 And then you walked out of your room and again, I stepped back.

295
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:11,520
 I don't know what was going on, Tiff, but I felt like you weren't you.

296
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:19,000
 I took a step back and you walked out of your room and you walked down the hallway and you

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 went into the bathroom.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,400
 It really scared me, it genuinely scared me to the, I don't know how you did it.

299
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,080
 I mean, I could probably fake being a marionette puppet, but the blink look on your face and

300
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,840
 just the feeling you gave me, what in the world were you doing this morning, Tiff?

301
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,600
 And Tiffany is processing this whole story and she goes, when did this happen?

302
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,160
 And Betty goes, 645, 645.

303
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,400
 And Tiffany goes, okay, here's the thing.

304
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,680
 Let's look at this logically.

305
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,480
 First off, that wasn't me.

306
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,240
 That wasn't me.

307
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,440
 So here's our options.

308
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,060
 One, I was sleepwalking maybe, but I've never sleptwalked before, never done that.

309
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
 What was I wearing?

310
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,720
 And Betty goes, you were wearing a white shirt and it had some, it had a lettering on the

311
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,920
 back and it had something on the back of it and black as you were walking on the hallway.

312
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,120
 And Tiffany goes, well, I went to bed in a red shirt.

313
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,560
 I woke up in a red shirt and I don't own a white shirt with black lettering on the back.

314
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,720
 And I was awake at 5.30 AM.

315
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,400
 I was awake.

316
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,880
 So it couldn't have been sleepwalking.

317
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,300
 And I remember waking up, I was most likely in my room around 6.45.

318
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:40,940
 But not doing creepy dances, not being this figure that instills utter fear in my sister.

319
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,580
 Definitely not jumping up and down like a little Mary and Epiphy.

320
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,620
 Tiffany and Betty just kind of look at each other.

321
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,780
 The mystery has begun.

322
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,420
 What was in Tiffany's room that morning?

323
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,240
 Now I say the mystery has begun, but it's also ended.

324
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
 This story was just posted online.

325
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,080
 It happened about what?

326
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
 Two weeks ago at this point?

327
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 A week and a half ago?

328
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,640
 March 6?

329
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,600
 And Tiffany's really like, I'm looking for any answers.

330
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,000
 And a lot of people were saying, well, maybe it was that maybe you were sleepwalking.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,320
 Maybe your sister was dreaming.

332
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,920
 Maybe she was dreaming that she saw.

333
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,760
 And Tiffany goes, pot, like that could be.

334
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,300
 My sister had an ultra realistic dream and she thought it was real, but I don't wear

335
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
 those clothes.

336
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,180
 I'm not a Mary and Epiphy.

337
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,340
 I blink like every other normal human.

338
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,780
 What happened in my house?

339
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,260
 She actually titles the post entity using my appearance.

340
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,500
 Need thoughts.

341
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,100
 Because that is kind of the paranormal answer where we're at.

342
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:56,680
 Some sort of doppelganger, some sort of demon, some sort of ghost.

343
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,560
 What's interesting is when I read this story, it was like one in the morning.

344
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,320
 And I read spooky stuff throughout the day.

345
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,560
 I read curiosities, bizarre stuff, horror stuff throughout the day and night.

346
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,980
 I live alone, so I'm constantly just sitting there in bed scrolling through stuff.

347
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:26,940
 This story, when I was reading it in the pitch black bedroom, save for the light on my phone,

348
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,740
 I immediately made sure, immediately made sure my feet were under the blanket.

349
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
 Normally I don't.

350
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,100
 Normally I just have the blanket maybe around my waist, if at all.

351
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,660
 A lot of times I don't sleep with the blanket at all.

352
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,080
 The Marionette dance.

353
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,440
 Looking through the crack of the door.

354
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,840
 And again, it's not like a sliver.

355
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,440
 She was enough to see Tiffany's face.

356
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
 She was enough.

357
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,360
 I think the crack of the door implies she has a super obscured sense of vision.

358
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,520
 It's not really that.

359
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:01,440
 The dance, the Marionette dance, for whatever reason, really, really creeped me out.

360
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,280
 Generally when humans do inhuman things like that, it is unsettling.

361
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,420
 And here we have something that is, if we're in the paranormal world, right, which we are

362
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:17,300
 because we're doing this podcast, something copying Tiffany's appearance, but getting

363
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,460
 certain details wrong.

364
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,100
 Certain telling details wrong.

365
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,540
 One, having a face that doesn't blink, but you could go, well maybe the entity is still

366
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,460
 trying to learn how to be human.

367
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,260
 And the reason why I keep saying entity is because the sister, Betty, she had a, a,

368
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,600
 aversion to this thing.

369
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,000
 She didn't, she felt she shouldn't get anywhere near this.

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,780
 But the face not moving correctly.

371
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,760
 We've seen that in old skinwalker stories where the creature slowly starts to learn

372
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,540
 how to be more human, how to blend in better.

373
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,120
 And the dancing, the Marionette dancing, it could have been it getting its motor running,

374
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,560
 basically, like troubleshooting everything, making sure it's moving.

375
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,220
 It could have also been, I find this idea interesting.

376
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,940
 If I could explain it correctly, that event could have not have happened.

377
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,060
 That could have been a psychic thing that Betty saw.

378
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,480
 She was actually at that point seeing the entity.

379
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,580
 The entity was just standing there perfectly still.

380
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,660
 But from Betty's point of view, she saw it being controlled like a Marionette puppet

381
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,860
 because basically her third eye was open and she was seeing what it truly was, a puppet.

382
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,940
 It didn't actually do the Marionette dance, but she perceived it doing the Marionette

383
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,940
 dance because what she's looking at is a puppet in the shape of her sister.

384
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
 Does that make sense?

385
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,700
 But then the idea that it has the wrong clothing.

386
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
 Like where'd she get that shirt from?

387
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,540
 Did she go to Forever 21?

388
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,660
 The spirits floating around the mall and be like, "Oh, I'm gonna take over a teenage

389
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,660
 girl's life today."

390
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,340
 But first, stylish, and it's like floating around and has a little montage that's trying

391
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,340
 to unclose.

392
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,540
 Where'd that t-shirt come from?

393
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,460
 Did it come from a past victim?

394
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,100
 This creature recently come from some other young woman's house and it had completely

395
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,300
 destroyed her life and her family's life and now it's here and this is a piece of clothing

396
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,180
 it's wearing from that house?

397
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,700
 Did it have a musical montage fashion show?

398
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
 Who knows?

399
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,940
 What was the writing on the back?

400
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,340
 Was it some catchy saying like, "Don't wake me before I've had coffee?"

401
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,820
 That's not really catchy, but I mean, don't go and train like that because no one will

402
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,940
 want it.

403
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:29,060
 Or was it some sort of weird spell or a warning ritual or what?

404
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
 Who knows?

405
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,500
 So, just a creepy story and this is a story that I remember I read it and I was like,

406
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 "Ugh, gross."

407
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 And I've covered myself up with my blanket.

408
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,300
 I can underneath my blanket with my flashlight.

409
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,100
 It's like, "It's too spooky to read."

410
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,660
 And then I was reading again the next, like a couple days later and I was like, "It's

411
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,860
 still really unnerved me.

412
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,940
 The story itself unnerves me."

413
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,460
 This might be a cursed story.

414
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,660
 This story, maybe just a big baby.

415
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
 That's true too.

416
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,540
 Maybe I'm just a big old baby, but it's also possible that this story is cursed.

417
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,660
 So, that's why I did include the warning in the beginning.

418
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
 Maybe not, right?

419
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,340
 This next story though may also be a little, it's a little spooky.

420
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,060
 I don't know if it's cursed, but for whatever reason, I've read this story a couple times.

421
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:21,020
 I got the idea that this may be not necessarily be something you want to talk about on a huge

422
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,740
 paranormal podcast because I may have just unleashed something.

423
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,460
 But maybe not.

424
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,300
 Maybe it's just a creepy story and it's that perfect segue into our next story.

425
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,420
 What happens when the person who's telling the story is the subject of it?

426
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,700
 Now, technically, Betty was telling the story to Tiffany, but Tiffany's telling it to us.

427
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,340
 A lot of times when we see these accounts of doppelgangers, they're saying, "I saw a

428
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,460
 doppelganger of my dad," or "I saw a doppelganger of the person I was out hunting with," or

429
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
 whatever.

430
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
 Very rarely.

431
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,720
 It does happen, but it's much more rare where the person telling the story says, "There's

432
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,180
 a doppelganger of me walking around.

433
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,500
 People are seeing another version of me."

434
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 But this next story takes it even further, really.

435
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,660
 It doesn't involve a doppelganger, but it really asks the question, "What if the person

436
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:19,460
 telling the story, experiencing the story, is the root problem of the story?"

437
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,220
 Nephilim operation wrinkled.

438
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,160
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carvener Coptre we are leaving behind this

439
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
 house in suburban America.

440
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:36,880
 We're headed all the way out to another house, also somewhere in suburban America.

441
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,800
 Again, I don't really know where this story takes place.

442
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,600
 This is an interesting story, though, and it starts at the point where we're the most

443
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,900
 hopeless when we're still in our mother's womb.

444
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,980
 Do babies make noises in the womb?

445
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
 I don't know.

446
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,540
 I know they eat food and they poop and then they either poop, but I wonder if they're

447
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
 a little vocal cords.

448
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
 They're like, "Meh."

449
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
 They're making noises.

450
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,460
 Anyway, let's ask this guy.

451
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,340
 He's a baby in this part of the story.

452
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,020
 This guy online, he goes by the name Personal Winter.

453
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
 5344.

454
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,340
 We're going to go ahead and call him Jimmy.

455
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
 But he's not named Jimmy yet.

456
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,280
 He's still a little dude, flown around in his mommy's belly.

457
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
 And this is the story that he heard.

458
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,480
 You don't remember this part of it, right?

459
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,960
 He's all peeking through the belly button.

460
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,560
 "I see you!"

461
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,920
 He was told as he was older that his father was really into demonology.

462
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,200
 I know not everyone gets to start off at the best point in life.

463
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,400
 If your dad's into so many demons, you're probably not going to have the easiest upbringing.

464
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,140
 But anyways, his dad's into demonology and he tells his wife, "Listen, we have the power

465
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,980
 right now to make our lives better.

466
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,300
 Let me perform this ritual on our unborn child and we can have a luckier life."

467
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,020
 The mom's like, "Ah, I mean on the one hand, on the one hand I do like luck, but on the

468
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,580
 other hand you're about to summon the dark forces of the universe into my womb."

469
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,100
 Somehow he talks her into this, right?

470
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,900
 Somehow he talks her into this.

471
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,720
 But he casts a ritual on top of her pregnant belly.

472
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,520
 He has like skulls there.

473
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,320
 I can imagine just all this stuff bounce on this woman's stomach.

474
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 She's like, "Ah."

475
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,960
 He has like human skulls maybe?

476
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,560
 I don't know, maybe rodent skulls.

477
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,720
 Probably the skulls that he could get.

478
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
 He has skulls.

479
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,920
 He has some candles.

480
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,400
 And a weird liquid that he has that he pours on Jimmy's house.

481
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
 Jimmy's living in his mom right now.

482
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,340
 And he's performing this ritual over Jimmy's little floating baby body.

483
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,740
 He's told about that when he was older, but he wasn't that much older before he started

484
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,900
 to experience some really, really bizarre events in life.

485
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,940
 He goes, "Listen, I have younger brothers and sisters, so I know what's normal.

486
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,300
 I know how kids normally act.

487
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 This isn't normal."

488
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,260
 The stuff that I went through wasn't normal because I didn't see any of my other brothers

489
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
 and sisters go through this.

490
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,680
 He goes, "When I was two years old, I was crying once.

491
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,600
 And I'm sitting there in the living room and I'm pointing and screaming.

492
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,840
 It was more of a screaming at something in the corner of the room and the family is trying

493
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
 to console me.

494
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,080
 And I'm just crying and crying and crying and I'm trying to explain what I saw.

495
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,440
 But what I saw is hard to explain, let alone for a two-year-old baby."

496
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:39,980
 He goes, "What I saw was this giant spider in the corner of the room and it had the face

497
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,940
 of an old white man just staring at me.

498
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,500
 And I'm crying and I'm pointing and they just wanted to go away and this giant spider with

499
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,540
 this face of an old white man is just crouched in the corner of the room and no one else can

500
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
 see it.

501
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,800
 No one else can get rid of this thing.

502
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 It just want it gone as this old man just stares."

503
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:11,680
 And it's interesting because I don't know as a rational outside observer, some of you

504
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,120
 guys may put rational in air quotes, "I don't know if it's a spider with the head of an

505
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,720
 old white man or if it's a spider."

506
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,440
 You're like, "Tayson, you're really, really, like these are both terrifying.

507
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,020
 I don't know if it's a spider with the head of an old white man or if it's a normal spider."

508
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,660
 Because he kept using the word "face."

509
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
 If it's not a normal spider, right?

510
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,740
 It's a giant spider and on the back of its belly, like on its big hard back, you know,

511
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,220
 that like you have to put the spear in it if you ever like shrink down the part that

512
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
 you stab.

513
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,620
 If that had like a face of an old man.

514
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,740
 Because in the world of the metaphysical, it could be both, right?

515
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
 Or one or the other.

516
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,100
 It could be either one is what I meant to say.

517
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,880
 In the world of like the metaphysical, it could be a spider with the image of like a projection

518
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 almost like you're looking at the spider.

519
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,200
 And again, what he's seeing is the old white man's soul trapped in the spider or it's part

520
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
 of the spider or it was an actual spider with an old man's head.

521
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,520
 Either one is going to make a two year old kid cry.

522
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
 Either one would make an adult cry.

523
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,400
 And what's interesting is at this point, Jimmy says, "The reason why I'm specifying that

524
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:27,620
 this is an old white man is because my dad hates white people, hates them."

525
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,640
 And it's almost like this spider would have been a representation of what my father despises

526
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
 most in the world.

527
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,340
 But again, you're two years old.

528
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,660
 I mean, it'd be super creepy, right?

529
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,340
 No one can do anything about this spider.

530
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,200
 But again, he thinks that there's a connection between the fact that his dad hates white people

531
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,080
 and they're seeing this spider.

532
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,840
 Fast forward a couple years.

533
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,260
 Little Jimmy is about five or six years old and the family gets called to go visit the

534
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,000
 grandparents.

535
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,080
 When Jimmy gets in the car and the family drives out to the grandparents house, they

536
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:16,460
 get there, the entire extended family is at the grandparents house.

537
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,540
 And Jimmy goes, "I remember running around the house and just kind of having fun or trying

538
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
 to have fun.

539
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,140
 You're always looking everywhere for spiders."

540
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,140
 And I was like, "Ah."

541
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,100
 But I remember the parents were talking and the uncles and aunts were talking and the

542
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
 grandparents were talking.

543
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,540
 It was just like boring, right?

544
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,460
 So I just kind of played in rooms as much fun as you can find in a grandparents house.

545
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,840
 I wasn't paying much attention to what they were talking about.

546
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,000
 I figured it was something serious.

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,160
 And then eventually, the grandma calls everyone into the room.

548
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,800
 All of the preliminary stuff is done.

549
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:57,200
 The grandma brings everyone into the room and she has an announcement for the families.

550
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:07,040
 She said, "Myself and the other women in our family have been talking to each other.

551
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:15,340
 We've all been experiencing very disturbing dreams.

552
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,820
 In these dreams, we are visited by an old white man."

553
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:27,420
 And he steals something from us.

554
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,960
 He takes something from us in the dream.

555
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,540
 The grandma says, "In each dream, it's different.

556
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,320
 In her dream, the old man stole money from her.

557
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:49,400
 In her dream, the old man took a life, stole away a loved one.

558
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:57,680
 But all of the women in the family have been visited in their sleep by the old white man."

559
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:10,480
 Now, it's not clear, but from what I understand, Jimmy did not tell them about the spider.

560
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,840
 At this point in the story, Jimmy had not mentioned anything because again, he was two

561
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 years old.

562
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,080
 He's not like, "Oh, the spider bite with the head on the spider or the head on the

563
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
 shell."

564
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,280
 I don't know why all of a sudden he's a torpedo.

565
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,520
 But was he really describing that?

566
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,080
 After having this meeting, and he's an afterthought, if he had said, "Oh, I saw this thing back

567
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,200
 when I was two," it would have been one thing.

568
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,280
 They weren't consulting him, right?

569
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,800
 So apparently at this point in the story, he has not told them about what he saw with

570
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 that spider.

571
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,000
 And again, how would a two-year-old even think that was notable?

572
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 To a two-year-old, that's just a normal thing.

573
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,920
 Sometimes spiders have the heads of old people.

574
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,200
 About a year or two later, Jimmy starts to suffer from serious sleep paralysis.

575
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,560
 It's brand new to him, right?

576
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,880
 This is something we study all the time.

577
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,160
 So I mean, we look at where you can't wake up, where you can wake up, but you can't move.

578
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,200
 And that's a lot of times you'll see stuff that may or may not be real.

579
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 You could still be dreaming.

580
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,920
 A lot of times we see shadow men or gray aliens or stuff like that.

581
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,000
 He starts to suffer through sleep paralysis.

582
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
 And he has a couple of creepy sleep paralysis stories, but that's what they are.

583
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
 They're sleep paralysis stories.

584
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,680
 So we'll move past those.

585
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,960
 And get to some of these other just odd, his life just becomes a collection of odd events.

586
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
 And they're spaced out so far.

587
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,280
 I mean, he is terrified of falling asleep each and every night.

588
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,440
 I'm like, "Oh, we'll just pass up that trauma to move on to this other stuff."

589
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
 Just these weird details.

590
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,200
 He remember once he came home, and there was a pair of shoes in his house.

591
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,960
 This is so weird, right?

592
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,640
 He comes home one day, and there's a pair of shoes in his house, and he looks down at

593
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,560
 them.

594
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,960
 And he said they were too big for a human.

595
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
 They were too big for a person.

596
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
 But I looked down at this pair of shoes in my house, and no one could fit into these shoes.

597
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,200
 And I just went about my day.

598
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,840
 He thought it was odd when it happened.

599
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,920
 He thinks it's odd because he's telling that to us late years later.

600
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,280
 But that is something that's so benign that I think a lot of people wouldn't even acknowledge.

601
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,720
 And you walk in, and there's a pair of size 15 shoes.

602
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,960
 And you go, and you break out your Sega Game Gear, and you're just playing games.

603
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
 You're like, "That's weird.

604
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,040
 I didn't know a clown lived here."

605
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,400
 But again, what is that?

606
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,840
 I just thought that was such a bizarre, creepy detail.

607
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,600
 Again, did he actually look down and see a physical pair of shoes, or did he see the

608
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,720
 representation?

609
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,280
 There was something that huge, that powerful, that had taken up residence in his house.

610
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,040
 And the only way his brain could make sense of that was seeing a giant pair of shoes next

611
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,640
 to where everyone else put their shoes when they came in the house.

612
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,360
 One time he sees a headless figure running down the hallway and running to his sister's

613
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
 room.

614
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,600
 He didn't say that he went after it.

615
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,520
 He didn't say he went in to go check on his sister.

616
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,400
 He's like, "Brakes have the Sega Game Gear."

617
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
 It's like, "She'll be okay.

618
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,760
 I mean, not like I've had a horrible childhood or anything.

619
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,200
 I gotta beat Ninja Gaiden."

620
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,400
 Years later, the grandma of the family dies, the matriarch, the woman who was giving this

621
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,720
 speech before about the dreams.

622
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,560
 She dies.

623
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,720
 And it completely shatters the family.

624
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,520
 Family completely dissolves.

625
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,640
 All of the aunts and uncles that had spread out over the years, and children and grandchildren,

626
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,040
 this would happen to my family too.

627
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,920
 When my grandma died, it was like you just snapped all those family chains.

628
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,840
 Sure, we see each other on Facebook, say hi and stuff like that, but all of those greetings

629
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,200
 and all of those holidays and all of that space we could be in and that person we all

630
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,960
 loved equally the same died.

631
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,400
 The family just fell apart.

632
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,680
 It was almost like this life raft for this family, right?

633
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
 So the family's in ruins.

634
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
 Well, not necessarily in ruins.

635
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
 Not much to test it to.

636
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,160
 The hobo's walking down the street.

637
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,520
 They're like, "Grandma, grandma paid our rent.

638
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,720
 She was the only reason we were able to eat pot roast."

639
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
 They're doing fine.

640
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:20,640
 They're still at the house, but the family ties, the ties of that bind have been severed.

641
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,160
 One night he wakes up and he hears a weird sound coming from his brother's room.

642
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,360
 He probably realized the automatic religion check on my sister on that headless freak

643
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
 ran inside.

644
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,160
 He actually gets up to investigate this one.

645
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
 He's older at this point.

646
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,920
 He's walking down the hallway and he hears this noise in his brother's room and he looks

647
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:52,200
 through the door and he sees his brother standing up over his bed, looking down at his bed.

648
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:00,600
 So the brother is standing looking at the brother's bed and sleeping in that bed is

649
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 his brother.

650
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:09,720
 And Jimmy ran down the hall probably probably didn't run, probably tiptoed silently, urinating

651
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,120
 the entire way and got back into his bed and he goes, "I couldn't even process what I had

652
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
 just seen."

653
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,200
 So we got another doppleganger going on there.

654
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,680
 And then, "Hey everyone, this is Jason from the future.

655
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,920
 I'm editing this episode.

656
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,080
 If you listen to the episodes the day they come out, you'll notice the one is really

657
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,580
 late.

658
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,720
 This episode is 100% cursed.

659
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,360
 Something weird has happened while I was editing it.

660
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:44,880
 The fact that part of the episode disappeared from the edit.

661
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,800
 This has not happened before.

662
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,720
 If anyone's familiar with audio program or really any program, there's undue keys and

663
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,640
 you're able to go back and make sure I didn't accidentally delete something at some point.

664
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,880
 And a pivotal section of the story, this part that's coming up, disappeared.

665
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,360
 I had to go back to a raw audio version that I keep for safety to find this.

666
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,440
 And even though I kept going through the edited version that you're hearing now, or you've

667
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,200
 heard up to this point, it never appeared in this episode.

668
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,600
 I actually almost missed it.

669
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,040
 I was finishing up the edit and I thought, "Well, I didn't hear this section."

670
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,080
 So this episode, I've never had come across this before.

671
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,600
 I've been using this program now for more than four years, but definitely four years

672
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 on the podcast.

673
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,200
 I think you guys can tell how tired I am and how serious I am when I'm saying that this

674
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,440
 next segment, I'm going to leave the audio as raw as possible.

675
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,640
 I'm not going to do my noise reduction or anything on it.

676
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
 This story's cursed.

677
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
 The story's...

678
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
 Listen to your own discretion.

679
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:06,440
 I know it's a bit of a cliffhanger, but definitely, I've never come across that before, the audio

680
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,880
 just disappeared.

681
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,680
 If I had not caught it, you would have been like, "Huh?"

682
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,200
 You might not even notice it missing, right?

683
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,160
 Because I ramble a lot, but definitely for whatever reason, this segment coming up with

684
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,000
 the grandmother disappeared from the edit.

685
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,560
 I had to go back to a raw audio take to include it.

686
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
 So here we go.

687
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,320
 Hey, guys.

688
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,480
 I'm going to tell you something real quick.

689
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,720
 I'm not trying to be overly dramatic.

690
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,600
 I'm recording this part maybe 20 minutes after you just heard that last part.

691
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:48,720
 I have had nothing but issues trying to stitch in 10 seconds into this show.

692
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,320
 This 10-second clip, I have had my key binds are all wonky.

693
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,080
 I could not find the file again.

694
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
 I found it.

695
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,040
 I put it into the editor file, and then it got deleted.

696
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,760
 I had to go back into the raw audio again.

697
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,120
 Had trouble even locating it there.

698
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
 It's weird.

699
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
 It's like a nine or 10-second segment.

700
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,520
 I'm having a hard time recording this.

701
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,800
 Any movement I make blips out.

702
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,240
 Guys, I've been doing this for four years, right?

703
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,800
 Audio problems are not an issue with this show.

704
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:34,120
 I'm going to play you this fairly unremarkable sounding clip with no audio processing whatsoever.

705
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,880
 You're going to hear it like it was recorded, and there is a very high chance that what

706
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:49,440
 you're about to hear is cursed because I'm having nothing but audio issues and recording

707
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,240
 issues and patience issues.

708
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,480
 So again, listener discretion is advised.

709
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,600
 Here we go.

710
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,560
 And then you'll hear the regular episode pop back up.

711
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,880
 Audio quality will return.

712
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,360
 And he wraps up his story like this.

713
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,000
 He goes one night, you know, I'm still suffering from sleep paralysis and stuff like that,

714
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,480
 and I'll wake up and I'll see the spider with the man's face watching me.

715
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,360
 But one of the most disturbing events, right?

716
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:25,600
 One night he woke up and he sees his grandmother standing over him.

717
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:33,560
 But he said nothing about her was her.

718
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:41,520
 She again, he again got that feeling like this was anything but his loving grandmother.

719
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,120
 And she just stood there standing over him.

720
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:59,040
 A huge smile spread across her silent face.

721
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,200
 He says I always joke about my dad doing booty stuff, but he did.

722
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,400
 It was just a couple of months ago he had confirmed this, that he had actually, that

723
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,920
 this spell was not just an urban legend.

724
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,080
 It was an urban legend only in one family, that it was real, that he was into that stuff.

725
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,160
 And what's interesting is he says shortly after he talked to his dad about that, he

726
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,880
 goes I watched a video of someone having sleep paralysis and seeing that spider with a man's

727
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
 face.

728
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,920
 So I gotta say it's a very, very interesting story.

729
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,880
 The grammar leaves a little bit to me.

730
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
 Imagine, I don't know if that means he was watching a video of a guy having sleep paralysis

731
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,640
 and then the spider jumped up in the video.

732
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,320
 Or if he saw the spider at a separate event, like when he went to go skip the ads, the

733
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,600
 spider showed up and goes, "Aha, that's how YouTubers get paid."

734
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,240
 I don't know.

735
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,320
 But what happens when you're a ghost hunter, you go to a location, you check out the location,

736
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:57,320
 maybe you do some razzle-dazzle and the spirit moves on, or maybe you're an exorcist.

737
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,720
 You do some razzle-dazzle and the demon moves on.

738
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,000
 But what happens when you're the problem?

739
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,440
 What happens when you're the haunted location?

740
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
 What happens when everything comes down to you?

741
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,720
 And people are saying, you know, you should start praying, you should go get an exorcist

742
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,560
 and all that stuff, and yeah, that's all well and good.

743
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,480
 I'd probably give him the same advice.

744
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,120
 But what type of bargain did his father make before he was even born?

745
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,160
 Like, it may not have a possession of his soul, it may have a possession of his physical body.

746
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,760
 The dad, 'cause Jimmy doesn't have any animosity towards white people, but the dad does.

747
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,760
 So it would make sense that this demonic figure that would come into their life took the form

748
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,920
 of what the father hated the most.

749
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,280
 And the worst part is the dad's not even seeing it.

750
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,200
 It's harassing the son.

751
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,520
 Now he's seeing these other events, he's seeing the headless figure going into the sister's room.

752
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,960
 He's seeing the brother staring at himself while he's sleeping.

753
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,400
 And which one was the real one, right?

754
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,440
 Was it a doppelganger standing up or was it a doppelganger in bed?

755
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,840
 And if you went to your bed and you were super sleepy and you saw your doppelganger in there,

756
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,800
 would you just be like, "I'll figure this out tomorrow?"

757
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,400
 But poor Jimmy, he is the haunted object.

758
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,880
 Like that stuff that he's seeing, they're not complaining about this stuff.

759
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
 The sister's like, "I have a new boyfriend!"

760
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,640
 There's photos of her standing there with a headless goblin.

761
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,680
 She's like, "Don't worry, he's really, really sweet and he has a great job."

762
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,440
 It seems to mostly be affecting him.

763
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,200
 It doesn't even seem to be affecting the dad.

764
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,560
 He's just kind of like, "Yeah, yeah, I did that stuff a long time ago.

765
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,080
 We got kind of lucky and then grandma died."

766
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,720
 And that's like, but then the grandma's coming back.

767
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,120
 Like it seems to all be circling around him.

768
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,880
 And this is going on right now.

769
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,280
 This story doesn't have a conclusion.

770
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,400
 It doesn't go, "Oh, and then I went to the local priest and we got the same car."

771
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,880
 No.

772
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,280
 The story ends with, "Yeah, my grandma, the other night or a couple weeks ago or whatever,

773
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,640
 showed up staring at me."

774
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,400
 Like this story is ongoing.

775
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
 He was cursed before he was born.

776
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:00,280
 And the family starts having these visions of this old white man sneaking into their dreams.

777
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,040
 And then it's still here.

778
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,240
 The things are still going on.

779
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,480
 And as a ghost hunter, as a paranormal researcher, this would be,

780
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,680
 "Your worst case scenario, if you were the problem, if you were the curse."

781
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:22,520
 And what's interesting is they're not putting forth any way of trying to help themselves

782
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,920
 or how to help themselves.

783
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:32,360
 It's just, I think I'm possessed on a website with like 11 views or whatever it is.

784
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,040
 And they're living their life right now as we continue to look up spooky stories and

785
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,360
 talk about dog buttholes.

786
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,840
 This guy is going through it right now.

787
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,920
 And who knows where this story ends.

788
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,120
 Was a bargain actually stricken with a dark spirit.

789
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:55,080
 And this spirit is now infesting the house and not just infesting the house, infesting the life,

790
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,320
 the experience of these people.

791
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,440
 And I think of that grandma, right?

792
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:06,600
 That she passed away and she was also taken under.

793
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,440
 By this dark spirit.

794
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,920
 Another figure, another creature, another sliver of unending evil.

795
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,920
 Appearing in our world.

796
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,200
 Taking the guise of this grandma because of some sort of ritual.

797
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,840
 Her son did.

798
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
 Because he wanted to get a little bit lucky.

799
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,120
 And instead ended up invoking such dark energy into the world.

800
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,480
 It's slowly destroying the entire family.

801
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,160
 And definitely having a detrimental effect on his son.

802
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,280
 And this story has not ended.

803
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,760
 But it asked that question what happens when you are the subject of research.

804
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,480
 What happens when you are the cursed object.

805
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,840
 It's easy to get rid of a cursed painting or a haunted doll.

806
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,440
 You can always leave a location that's been taken over by evil forces.

807
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,720
 But what if you are that location?

808
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,600
 How do you defeat a curse?

809
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,640
 If you are the curse.

810
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,120
 If you are the problem.

811
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,680
 If you're the source of the evil.

812
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,360
 I think sooner or later, Jimmy is going to have to figure that out.

813
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,360
 Because if he thinks his life is already filled with unexplainable horrors.

814
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:31,640
 He has no idea what waits him on the other side of death.
