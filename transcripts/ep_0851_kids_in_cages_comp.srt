1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
 A friend in mead is a friend indeed, goes the old saying, but today we're gonna take

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,440
 a look at two stories that push that to the test.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,240
 First off, do you have a friend you love so much that if they were being haunted by a

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,640
 potato-nosed demon, you would wish that demon to come to your house?

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,440
 I know it's super convoluted, bro.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 I know it's super convoluted.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
 Just roll with it.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,320
 Then we meet a man who is out fossil hunting in the middle of nowhere.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,280
 And he is waylaid by a group of aliens and taken aboard their spacecraft.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,620
 And it is on this spacecraft where he will face the ultimate test.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,760
 What type of man is he?

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,200
 Is he a coward?

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,680
 Or is he a man who's willing to fight back against the alien interlopers?

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:01:14,080
 Today on the Season 18 Opener of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,680
 Season 18 of Dead Rabbit Radio, this is the start.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,360
 We're getting to the four-year anniversary of Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
 So many shows, so many wonderful memories, all of these great stories.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
 The future of Dead Rabbit Radio is, we got some cool stuff coming up this season.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,560
 Not just story-wise, but some cool other projects.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,200
 Some cooler things that are going on.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
 But the podcast will always remain the flagship of the Dead Rabbit Radio Empire.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,480
 The Dead Rabbit Radio Empire would be nothing without you guys.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 You specifically.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,520
 Not anyone else listening to it.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,720
 Just you right now listening to this podcast.

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,840
 You, all you guys.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,600
 You guys are the linchpin of the Dead Rabbit Radio Empire.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,040
 So thank you so much for that.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,760
 We're going to watch it explode this year, 100%.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,280
 And someone who's currently building the explosives for this explosive season is one of our newest

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
 Patreon supporters.

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command, don't shake your hands because they're covered with gunpowder.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 Give it up for Elizabeth Monroe.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 Woo!

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
 Clapping, we're all blown up.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,400
 She's clapping, she's blowing herself up too.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,280
 I don't know where, I don't know where any of this is going.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,520
 Elizabeth Monroe, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,720
 You guys can't support the Patreon, or if you don't want me to implicate you in international

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,840
 terrorism, that's fine too.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,160
 That really, really, really, really helps out a lot.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,240
 Elizabeth, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason J.

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 Loppy.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,000
 Let's take that car cover off of it.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,880
 We haven't used this thing in about two weeks.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,440
 We're driving all the way out to a small suburb in America.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
 [imitates car engine]

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,240
 Elizabeth, stop the car right here.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,680
 We're parked outside of this house.

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 It's a nondescript house, right?

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,080
 It looks like everyone else's house.

54
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,880
 The reason why we're outside this house is recently someone online going by the name

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,120
 of Born Confused posted this thing.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,680
 They titled this little post.

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,600
 I don't know how to help my friend.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 They're looking for advice on this situation.

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,440
 So Jerry has a friend named Chris.

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,440
 This whole story's happened super recently.

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,200
 We're talking the week of March 28th, 2022.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,080
 And Chris has been complaining to Jerry, "Hey dude, oh man, I don't know how your week's

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 been going.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 I don't know.

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,120
 I don't know how everything's been going in your life."

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,960
 But recently I feel like I'm being watched.

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,840
 I feel like when I'm in my house, there is something else in the house watching everything

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
 I do.

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,880
 And I do a lot of weird stuff, so I'm a little concerned.

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,280
 I can no longer watch all that furry porn.

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
 But I don't know if you watch furry porn.

72
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
 I just threw that in there.

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,720
 Okay, don't come after me, Chris.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,120
 But anyway, so Chris says, "Listen, I always feel like I'm being watched in my house."

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,480
 And then what's just recently happened, and that's been going on for weeks, but what's

76
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,200
 recently happened back on the week of March 26th, I start to get sick.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,480
 I'm like, "Oh man, I don't feel good.

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,920
 I don't want to cheer me up some furry porn."

79
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,240
 He starts feeling sick and he doesn't know what to do about that.

80
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,680
 And then he calls up Jerry one night and says, "Hey, you want to go hang out?

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,440
 I feel super sick, but you know, let's spread this illness, this mysterious illness."

82
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
 Calls up Jerry and says, "Hey, you want to go hang out?

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
 I just kind of need to get out of this house."

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
 So it's Chris is getting ready to go hang out with Jerry.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 He's kind of moving it.

86
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
 We all do this, right?

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,200
 We move from room to room as we're getting stuff ready.

88
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
 The living room light is on.

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,120
 Chris was hanging out in the living room previous to this and he gets off the phone with Jerry

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,640
 and goes, "Oh, I need to go get ready to go out."

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,080
 So he goes into his bedroom and he's kind of like packing some stuff up, getting his

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,520
 wallet, his watch, whatever it is.

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 And when he comes back out into the living room, the lights are off in the living room.

94
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,080
 He's like, "Oh, okay."

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,880
 And he just figures, "I must have shut it off.

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
 You know, I'm not feeling that great.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,280
 I must have shut it off and forgotten about it."

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,000
 So he walks over, he turns back on the living room light, goes back into the bedroom to finish

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 getting ready.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,920
 And when he comes back out into the living room, the lights off.

101
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,400
 Now the first time you could think, you know, I might have forgotten.

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 I might have forgotten.

103
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 I might have forgotten.

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
 I'm Batman and I just sit around in the dark living room all the time.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
 I might have shut the light off and not been aware of that.

106
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,040
 But the second time, obviously, right, like, it's not a mistake.

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,800
 The second time you're like, "I know for sure I just turned that light on because I just

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,600
 have this internal monologue about this whole thing."

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,680
 Something is shutting my light off.

110
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,880
 This time though, when he goes to turn the light back on, when he flicks that switch,

111
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,920
 the light bulb explodes.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,160
 And in a split second when that flash of light illuminates the dark living room, he sees

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 standing in the darkness, illuminated for just a split second, a shape.

114
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,160
 What he describes is, I don't know if this, you could classify this as an alien or a ghost

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,760
 or a daemon, because it's all over the place.

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,160
 First off, it's five feet four inches tall, but with really broad shoulders.

117
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,600
 Like, if you were walking around in your house and you turn the corner and there was someone

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,800
 who was five foot four and they had like tiny shoulders, you could probably just like tackle

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
 them.

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 But, like Jason, "Oh, we don't have kids.

121
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,640
 I hope you don't have kids walking around in your house.

122
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 I'm all picking them up."

123
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
 I'm like, "Take that alien."

124
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
 They're like, "Ah!"

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 No, I mean, it would be scarier, right, if you had the choice between fighting a tiny

126
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,600
 guy in your house if they had broad shoulders or not, right?

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,280
 They have tiny hips, they have tiny little shoulders and tiny hips.

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
 I'm like, "Oh no, I don't know if I'm supposed to tackle this person."

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,080
 It's a tiny little dude with really broad shoulders, long white hair coming out of its

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,000
 head just standing there in the darkness.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,160
 It has, it's eye, he described it as having a human face.

132
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
 It's interesting.

133
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,520
 Chris said that this had a human face, but then detailed a bunch of stuff that's inhuman.

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,600
 One, the eyes were completely white and the nose looked like a potato.

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
 Potato coming out of the face.

136
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,840
 I'm assuming it wasn't like potato colored.

137
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,240
 I just made like a big lumpy nose, like a squidward nose.

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,080
 And then, this is an odd detail.

139
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,520
 Not like everything else makes sense, but its teeth are described, because it gets real

140
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
 close, look at this thing.

141
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,160
 The teeth are described as, I had to look this up on YouTube, I was like, "What?"

142
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,800
 The teeth of this little potato-nosed monster man, it had teeth that looked like, quote,

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 "Ester's teeth."

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 It's so weird.

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 "Ester's teeth."

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 Let me finish this sentence.

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 Who's Esther?

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 Let me finish this sentence real quick.

149
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 I don't know why it took such a long pause.

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:08:00,240
 They looked like, quote, "Ester's teeth from the movie Orphan."

151
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,920
 Now, if you've seen the movie Orphan, you've probably have said that I reminded you of

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
 it.

153
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 You're like, "Oh man, I thought I was open.

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
 I never heard the name of that movie again."

155
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 Orphan is the movie.

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,680
 I'm going to spoil it for you.

157
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,080
 It's about this mom and this dad.

158
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,160
 They adopt this young girl, this nine-year-old girl from some Bulgarian orphanage, and the

159
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
 girl's trying to bang the dad.

160
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,600
 Now, this is a mainstream release, right?

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,080
 I didn't download this on a tour or something like this.

162
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
 This was a mainstream release.

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 Don't judge me.

164
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,280
 They adopted this nine-year-old daughter, and she's trying to sleep with the dad.

165
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,680
 I think she's trying to kill the mom.

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,080
 She keeps trying to push the mom off of balconies.

167
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,000
 The whole house is nothing but balconies.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,800
 I don't remember it, but I do remember a little bit of it because I had to look this

169
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,000
 scene up on YouTube.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,720
 It turns out that it's not a nine-year-old girl.

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,960
 It turns out that it's a 34-year-old woman who has a disease that makes her look like

172
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,240
 a nine-year-old girl, which is not any less disturbing, really.

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
 But part like so, I'm watching this clip on YouTube, and it was explaining.

174
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 It was so weird.

175
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,000
 I typed in Esther's teeth.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I think that's what I put in.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,680
 I typed in Esther's teeth, orphan.

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,520
 I looked it up on YouTube, and it showed the exact scene where it turns out when she's

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,680
 not really nine years old, she had fake nine-year-old teeth.

180
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
 She had like these, I don't know where she got these grills made.

181
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
 She went to Nelly.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,200
 She has these grills that is nine years old in diamonds on gold teeth.

183
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,920
 She's like, "That's old, I am."

184
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,440
 She has fake teeth, and she takes them out.

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,200
 But apparently, if you're 34 years old and you live in Bulgaria, your teeth are just

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,280
 completely busted up.

187
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
 But if you're nine years old, you have perfect teeth.

188
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,640
 She takes--nine years--now they think about nine-year-olds have way worse teeth than 34-year-olds.

189
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,800
 Anyways, she takes out her--you're like, "She's getting back to the alien story, dude.

190
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,160
 We're totally in suspense.

191
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,840
 This potato knows the demon or whatever's in this guy's house.

192
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
 Hold on.

193
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,240
 Let me finish talking about a movie that came out in 2007 that I haven't seen since 2009.

194
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,960
 Esther's teeth are basically all busted up.

195
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,000
 Like teeth are like kind of crooked and stuff like that.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,480
 They're not remarkable.

197
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,600
 If you asked me, "Hey Jason, what do you remember about the movie Orphan?"

198
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,800
 The last thing would be her teeth.

199
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,400
 I'd be like, "Oh, the movie about the nine-year-old who's trying to bang the dad, but it turns

200
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,760
 out she's really 34 and it had an awful lot of balconies in that house."

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
 I wouldn't remember the teeth.

202
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,680
 But anyways, so this potato-nosed monster man has Esther's teeth from Orphan, so basically

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,200
 just messed up teeth.

204
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,440
 And remember this all happens in a flash.

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,320
 He's able to take in all this information that light bulb explodes, the dark room is

206
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,440
 illuminated and he's like, "Ugh!"

207
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,720
 And he sees this whole thing, right?

208
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,600
 This is where I ask you, "What would you do in this situation?"

209
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,800
 He, he, Chris goes, "Chris goes, okay, it's all gobbling in the corner of my room, but

210
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 now it's dark.

211
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 I'm going to go get a new light bulb for my living room."

212
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 That's weird, right?

213
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,280
 But anyways, so Chris goes and he gets a new light bulb and he screws it in and then

214
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,040
 he turns the light on and he's shocked, shocked that when he turns the light, right, this

215
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,520
 has been going on for a couple minutes now, he turns the light back on and he's shocked

216
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,520
 the little creature is once again illuminated, standing in his living room, so now he runs

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
 out of his house.

218
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,840
 So he's now established this creature is in his house.

219
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,880
 And then a couple days later, this actually happened on March 31st, he is back in his

220
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
 house, right?

221
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
 Because I would leave my house if there was a gobbling.

222
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
 I've seen ghosts and stuff in my house.

223
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,760
 I saw that one time, that murdered dude sitting on my couch, he's all purple and bloated.

224
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,520
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

225
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,800
 I spent too much time talking about Orph and I can't go into that story.

226
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,480
 But you know, I've seen ghosts and stuff in my house, but it'd be different if there's

227
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,360
 like a gobbling or an alien or whatever this thing is kind of hanging out in the corner

228
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 of my house.

229
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
 It'd be like, "No, I'm out, bro."

230
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 He comes back home.

231
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,520
 I'd have to come back home eventually, right?

232
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,280
 But he comes back home eventually as well and he's like tippity tappitying on his computer,

233
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,960
 typing some stuff in.

234
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
 And this is just before bed.

235
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,920
 He's trying to get some work done before he goes to bed.

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
 And his computer starts to kind of go haywire and doing all that stuff.

237
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,840
 And then it gets the blue screen of death.

238
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,080
 His computer hits that blue screen and he's like, "Dammit, I just wanted to get this work

239
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
 done."

240
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,680
 But usually when the screen goes blue, it automatically restarts itself and then you

241
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,680
 can make sure all your files are saved and all that stuff.

242
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,720
 And he's sitting there and he's looking at this blue screen on his computer and he's

243
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 like whatever.

244
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,440
 And he gets up and he kind of starts pacing around his living room, waiting for the computer

245
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,360
 to reboot and it doesn't.

246
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
 It's not doing it.

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
 So he walks over there to shut it off.

248
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,680
 And as he's walking back over to shut off his computer right in front of his face, like

249
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:51,760
 appearing just inches from his face, is this creature, like face to face, this little five

250
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,280
 foot three monstrosity, smiling with them orphan teeth.

251
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,880
 And he freaks out.

252
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
 Right?

253
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,600
 Now, this had no trickery of the light.

254
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,040
 This had no, you could say is a skeptic, "Oh, maybe turning the light on and off."

255
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
 This trick of the light.

256
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
 And maybe the light bulb exploding was a trick of the light.

257
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
 Maybe there's still, maybe he never replaced that light bulb.

258
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,480
 It's all trick of the light.

259
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,760
 But now when you're like walking around, there's no changes to the light.

260
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,520
 You're walking towards a computer and then appearing right in front of you.

261
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,240
 Is this creature, that's terrifying.

262
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,320
 That is, that again is another terrifying thing.

263
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,040
 When I'm sitting there and I look and I see a ghost, that's always, I've seen ghosts before.

264
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,240
 It's always, it's always scary, but there's something non-caporial about them.

265
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,520
 There's something that because they don't have a physical presence, you go, "This little

266
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
 dude can't hurt me."

267
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 Right?

268
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,920
 But what's appearing here seems to be taking up 3D space.

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
 This thing seems to be some sort of physical entity.

270
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
 So he bounces out of the house.

271
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 Chris leaves the house.

272
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 Now what's interesting about this story?

273
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,000
 I mean everything, right?

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,520
 The little guy of hearing all of the electronics not working, all of this physical damage like

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,200
 busting the light bulb.

276
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,280
 That's really interesting from a paranormal slant.

277
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,960
 Messing with the computers, very interesting from a paranormal slant.

278
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,080
 So what I find interesting is the person who's telling this story is not Chris.

279
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
 It's Jerry.

280
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,400
 Jerry is the one, remember, who posted this saying, "I don't know how to help my friend."

281
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
 And Jerry goes, "Listen, my friend's going through this.

282
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,920
 It's really messing with their head.

283
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,280
 How can I protect them?"

284
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,400
 They go, "Even if I had to transfer whatever this is," because again we don't know if it's

285
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,240
 an alien or a demon.

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,440
 The reason why I keep defaulting to alien is because of the height, right?

287
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,480
 Generally like 5'4", 4'9", whatever, that's kind of the gray alien height.

288
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,520
 So that's why I kind of keep defaulting to that.

289
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 I don't know why.

290
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,720
 It doesn't have really any of the other characteristics of a gray alien.

291
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,760
 Gray aliens tend to have black eyes, they tend to have big heads, they tend not to be super

292
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,680
 broad shoulders, so it could also be a demon.

293
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
 It doesn't sound like a ghost, though.

294
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,160
 It doesn't sound like a ghost.

295
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
 So we have all that stuff.

296
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,040
 What are we actually facing?

297
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,360
 But remember the point of this story being posted was Jerry wants to help out their friend.

298
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,560
 Jerry is asking, "Is there anything that I can do?"

299
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,080
 Now what, this was a really interesting story for me to look at because I've had a lot of

300
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,640
 personal paranormal encounters throughout my life and I can't recall a time.

301
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,720
 I could be mistaken by this, but I can't recall a time that a close friend of mine was

302
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,920
 experiencing some sort of paranormal phenomenon that they needed me to help with.

303
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,600
 They probably thought I would just make things worse.

304
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 So it was interesting to read the story from the point of view of the friend saying, "My

305
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
 buddy's going through this, how can I help?"

306
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,080
 Because normally either I'm seeking this stuff out as a ghost hunter, I've been doing it

307
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,520
 for 30 some odd years, or that it was already circulating around me.

308
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 I'm trying to think of a time and I couldn't really think of a time that one of my friends

309
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
 was like, "Hey, I need your help."

310
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,240
 So that in and of itself was interesting, but also I have to say this.

311
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,040
 Just in case you're wondering, Jerry, for listening to this episode, I don't have any

312
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 tips for you.

313
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
 I mean, generally when I see people online posting about problems they're having, I

314
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,840
 always recommend talking to whoever their spiritual advisor is.

315
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,760
 So I always say that, go talk to whatever spiritual community you belong to, speak to

316
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,360
 their priest or rabbi or whatever.

317
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,680
 But then also there's Jerry in this post in a very interesting way, which almost makes

318
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,600
 me think there's another motive here.

319
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,320
 Almost makes me think they don't just want to help their friend.

320
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,440
 Maybe they do, but this is a conspiracy theory podcast, so even you, Jerry, are worthy of

321
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
 a conspiracy.

322
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,320
 I'm saying, "Listen, I want to help out my buddy Chris so badly.

323
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,000
 I want to get this little potato-nosed monster out of his house so badly.

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,800
 Is there any way to help?"

325
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,920
 And I would even be willing to have this entity transferred to me.

326
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,880
 I would rather my house be haunted than Chris's house be haunted.

327
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,840
 Is there any way that we can do this?"

328
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,480
 They literally typed "I shift from side to side."

329
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,000
 I'm very suspect of that.

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Very suspect of that.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And this is why.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,040
 In conspiracy theory podcast, don't sue me, Jerry, but there are a lot of people who

333
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,760
 want to experience paranormal phenomenon and they can't or they haven't, or both, right?

334
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 There's a lot of people who really want to experience this stuff.

335
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,760
 Now I'm wondering if Jerry really is trying to save Chris from this potato-nosed monster

336
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,440
 or if they want to experience it themselves.

337
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,040
 I'm wondering if Jerry is jealous of Chris.

338
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,080
 They're flicking their lights on and off, on and off.

339
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,520
 I'm hoping to see this little man.

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,720
 They've watched Orphan for the seventh time that day.

341
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
 They're like, "Oh, memories.

342
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
 If only you were in my house, creepy monster man."

343
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
 I'm wondering if that's part of it.

344
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,640
 I'm wondering if that's part of it.

345
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,560
 Now again, I'm a conspiracy theorist.

346
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,320
 And I gotta say this, this story is just starting off, right?

347
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
 I can understand.

348
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,760
 Like, we don't know how this is going to go.

349
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,680
 We don't know how this story is going to progress.

350
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,040
 So imagine if this is one of those murder demons, right?

351
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 That possesses you.

352
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,640
 And the next thing you know, you're walking through the neighborhood naked, covered in

353
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,560
 blood, and you're ripping dogs apart with your bare hands and things like that.

354
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
 True story.

355
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
 That actually happened.

356
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,040
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

357
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,640
 Yeah, it'd be one thing.

358
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,200
 If someone was like, "Hey, dude, there's this little ghost monster alien walking around

359
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,040
 with busted up teeth in my house."

360
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,160
 And it's been going on for like months, and it like knocks over a couple pieces of jewelry

361
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,360
 every so often, and whispers in my ear when I'm sleeping.

362
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,320
 I might be willing to take that dude on because his track record, first I don't know any

363
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 jewelry, right?

364
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 And I'm a deep sleeper.

365
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,800
 And his track record, he's been around for months.

366
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,440
 All he's doing is just kind of being annoying.

367
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,080
 I might say, "Oh, you send that guy my way."

368
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,880
 But if the ghost, if whatever this is, if it's just, we don't even know what it is.

369
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,680
 And this guy's like, "Let it come to my house."

370
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,800
 Like, you have to have, you want to know what it's doing.

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 You don't want to invite a murder demon in your house.

372
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,920
 We don't know if this is like a lovable chap who just hates light bulbs.

373
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,840
 I guess if he's black, I guess if he's exploding light bulbs above your head, he's not E.T.

374
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,920
 That's already a little dangerous.

375
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
 I just thought that was a little irresponsible.

376
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,320
 If it's a murder demon, let it possess your friend first.

377
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,200
 But yeah, I would be willing to take on a ghost, like a friendly ghost, or do like one

378
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,640
 of those sexy Victorian ghosts, and like their big old dresses and stuff like that, little

379
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,960
 petticoat holding a little umbrella, like floating through the house.

380
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,600
 Send those babes my way.

381
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,440
 But I wouldn't be super quick to jump on just like a first time haunting.

382
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
 Like, you know what I mean?

383
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,960
 Does this make sense?

384
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 I think it does.

385
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
 I think it does.

386
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
 Send me the ghosts that we know what they do.

387
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
 Don't send me a ghost that's just, or what?

388
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 I see it.

389
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,440
 I keep saying, we don't even know what this is.

390
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
 Super creepy.

391
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,280
 Super creepy, like not even being able to categorize it makes it terrifying.

392
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,160
 Don't invite this stuff to your house is what I'm saying, Jerry.

393
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,040
 Let it destroy your friend's life.

394
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,280
 And I mean, if you can stop it before that, that's preferable, right?

395
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
 But if you can't, don't invite it into your life.

396
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 That's basically what I'm saying.

397
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,240
 I know I started this off by talking about helping your friends out and stuff like that,

398
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,720
 but there's a limit.

399
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 That my limit is murder demon, right?

400
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,680
 I'll be willing to give you a couple bucks.

401
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,040
 I'll be willing to help you change the tire or house sit for you.

402
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,440
 But my, I have a pretty hard limit.

403
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
 It involves murder demons.

404
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,680
 We don't know what this guy is.

405
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,960
 I wish Chris and Jerry the best.

406
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,920
 Maybe Jerry doesn't have any ulterior motive and wants to experience the paranormal for

407
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
 themselves.

408
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,520
 Maybe they truly want their friend to not be scared anymore.

409
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,760
 Who knows?

410
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,840
 But we'll keep an eye on this.

411
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,720
 If all of a sudden they start posting in gibberish and we see a rash of dog ripping incidents,

412
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
 we will know who did it.

413
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,000
 The radio covered it first.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,160
 But yeah, little monster potato-nosed man with orphan teeth floating around in this

415
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,360
 guy's living room.

416
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,440
 Let it flow around his living room, Jerry.

417
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,520
 Don't ask for too much trouble.

418
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,400
 That story went on way longer than I thought it would, but we are just getting started

419
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 with season 18.

420
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,560
 So Elizabeth Monroe, let's toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

421
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
 Grab those.

422
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 We're leaving behind.

423
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,080
 These two people are getting possessed.

424
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,800
 Their noses are swelling up to become potatoes.

425
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
 We're leaving them behind.

426
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,120
 I'm sure everything will be okay.

427
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
 We're leaving those guys behind.

428
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,200
 We're headed all the way out to Australia.

429
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:06,320
 Specifically, we're headed to South Australia to a place known as Sturt's Stony Desert.

430
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,600
 It's a sunny afternoon in January 1974 and a young man named Ben is driving his car across

431
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
 the desert.

432
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 I don't know.

433
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,080
 Maybe there was a road, right?

434
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 I don't know.

435
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,600
 I didn't check Google Maps, but he's driving it through this area.

436
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,240
 And Ben, he's 38 years old.

437
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,600
 He's driving through this region.

438
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
 He's out with this girl.

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 He's out with it.

440
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
 He's taking this girl out on a date.

441
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 He's like, "Hey, Betty."

442
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,280
 I don't know exactly what her name was, but hey, Betty, let's go drive out to Sturt's

443
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,840
 Stony Desert.

444
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,200
 I got a hobby.

445
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
 I find fossils in the middle of nowhere.

446
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,280
 I don't know if this was their first date or their third date or they'd been dating for

447
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:55,120
 a long time, but I don't know how many dates you have to have before you're willing to

448
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,200
 go into a remote region looking for bones of things because I'd be afraid I was going

449
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,000
 to become part of their fossil collection.

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,040
 But anyways, apparently she trusts this dude.

451
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,400
 Ben drives all the way out there.

452
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,640
 And it's time to go fossil hunting.

453
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,480
 Now he says, "Listen, lady, fossil hunting is a fantastic activity for old and even

454
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,320
 older people, kids, find it super boring, but we're going to walk around and we're just

455
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,720
 going to look for bones.

456
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,800
 We're going to find like flip over little rocks and it'll be like a little trilobite

457
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,360
 going, "Oh!"

458
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,760
 Like he caught him right when he died.

459
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,080
 His little, his little fin is up to his mouth.

460
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,800
 And then we flip over a big rock and it's a T-Rex.

461
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,840
 It's a giant T-Rex underneath this rock.

462
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,800
 We're just going to walk around and flip rocks over and just like kick dust, kick dust.

463
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,840
 Maybe he has one of those little brooms to brush stuff off and he finds like a skull.

464
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
 I don't know.

465
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,840
 Anyways, this dude, he brings his date out to this fossil area.

466
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,280
 I guess there's a bunch of fossils here.

467
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,120
 And he goes, "Let's do this, but this is your, this is, this is what he actually said.

468
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,680
 This is your first time out here.

469
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
 I don't want you to get lost."

470
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:09,880
 Now I just imagine this car sitting in this desert that you can see for miles in any direction

471
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,520
 and he's like, "Stay here.

472
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,920
 Because you're this possibility that you can't see more than 200 yards in front of you."

473
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,760
 He leaves her.

474
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,240
 He leaves her out of the car and begins walking around looking for fossils.

475
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,720
 So again, terrible whatever date they're on.

476
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,400
 This is the worst date ever.

477
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,520
 So he walks about two kilometers away, which doesn't, it's really not that far.

478
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 It sounds far, but it's only like a mile and a half.

479
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,920
 So he could probably turn around and like wave to her and she'd be like, "Oh, she's

480
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,480
 like on back of a superboard.

481
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 I don't even have a smartphone."

482
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,240
 And he's like, "Stay there.

483
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
 You might get lost."

484
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,360
 And he's walking and he's looking for fossils.

485
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,880
 Maybe he found some right, picking up a rock, flipped it over a little trilobite.

486
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,760
 And he suddenly sees, just really appear out of nowhere.

487
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,880
 Again, it'd be hard to sneak up on someone in this region.

488
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,560
 All of a sudden, he sees these two dudes walking towards him.

489
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,400
 Now both of these guys were only about three and a half feet tall.

490
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,880
 Other than that, they look normal.

491
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,400
 Well, okay, let me back up there.

492
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,040
 Other than that, and their face look totally normal.

493
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,400
 No potatoes anywhere on their facial features.

494
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,560
 They had arms and legs.

495
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,640
 They're wearing these silver suits.

496
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,960
 But the back of their heads were elongated.

497
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,080
 So they didn't have the typical giant gray alien dome, but the back of the head went

498
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
 whoop, just like kind of popped out, right?

499
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,760
 So that's weird, right?

500
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,680
 Silver suits, big old heads, tiny people.

501
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 So yeah, not necessarily human looking.

502
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,880
 Almost sounds like an alien human hybrid.

503
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,520
 But anyways, these two dudes are walking up to him and he kind of takes them off guard

504
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,000
 because it's not like he'd be the only person looking for fossils out here, but they were

505
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,600
 like bam, right there.

506
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,880
 You didn't really see him approaching in the distance.

507
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,640
 And they're talking to each other and they start talking to him, but the problem is,

508
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,080
 he goes, "They were speaking so quickly, I couldn't understand them."

509
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
 It's interesting, it doesn't specifically say they were speaking a different language,

510
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,320
 but they were speaking so quickly, he didn't know what they were saying.

511
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,720
 And they're looking at him and they're talking to each other and they're talking to him and

512
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,000
 he's like, "What is going on?"

513
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,920
 And then they kind of start beckoning him to follow them.

514
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,680
 And they turn around, they walk a couple feet and then turn back and kind of wave their

515
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
 hands, "Come here, come here."

516
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
 But they wouldn't say that, right?

517
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,520
 He's not a cat, he's not a house cat, they leave out a little bit of milk for him.

518
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,800
 They leave out a tasty fossil for him.

519
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,640
 So he begins to walk with these guys and he walks for a short distance and then he looks,

520
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,080
 he sees this massive silver ship just sitting there.

521
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,120
 He said it looked like a hot dog bun.

522
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,080
 It wasn't split down the middle, but it just looked like a big old bun, big, long bun.

523
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,840
 And what he couldn't figure out, this was about 26 feet long.

524
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,640
 Again, what he couldn't figure out was, "How did I not see that?"

525
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,120
 I'm not seeing that from the car, right?

526
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,800
 I'm only a mile and a half away from the car.

527
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 How did I not see that?

528
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,360
 Definitely, how did I not see that?

529
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,840
 How did these guys get the drop on me?

530
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,680
 He has no idea what's going on.

531
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,600
 At this point though, unlike the little potato nose demon in the first story, you can classify

532
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,200
 this story easily as alien, right?

533
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,440
 These guys don't have a little Casper feet, they're not floating around.

534
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,560
 This is definitely an alien story.

535
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,680
 And it's 1974, he's well aware of all of the alien flying saucer stuff.

536
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,500
 He knows exactly what he's looking at.

537
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:44,080
 He though is frightened of what will happen if he doesn't do what they say.

538
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,280
 He's definitely not an alien aficionado.

539
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,720
 This guy cares more about the past than the future.

540
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,200
 He's looking for fossils, not laser guns.

541
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,520
 I'm sure there are a lot of people who like history who would love to be on a UFO.

542
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,600
 But this whole time, he constantly is second guessing whether or not he should walk with

543
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,800
 these little people.

544
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,080
 Now he's second guessing, "Should I get on the ship?"

545
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,320
 But he's afraid of what happens if he doesn't.

546
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,760
 So he walks on board this ship and the first thing he realizes is once he's on...

547
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,280
 This is one of these details that I really love about these stories, right?

548
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:31,520
 He gets on the ship, he said it was from the outside, it was 26 feet long and 6 feet wide.

549
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,040
 But once he gets inside, the vessel's massive.

550
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,040
 The outside dimensions don't truly give the scope of what it is inside.

551
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,800
 At this point, this is interdimensional technology.

552
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,120
 He's looking around and he goes, "Where I'm at is way bigger in the interior than 26

553
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,680
 by 6 feet."

554
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,280
 Just fascinating way that these vessels are.

555
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,040
 So he's walking around and he sees a bunch more of these little alien people.

556
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,360
 What was interesting is all of the other people, the two people who picked him up are these

557
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
 two dudes.

558
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,040
 But when he gets on the ship, they're all female.

559
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,400
 All the other members of this crew are female with the big old heads and the tiny little

560
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,320
 bodies and the silver suits and they're walking around and one of these women come up and

561
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,840
 they hand him a drink.

562
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,400
 Now he says specifically, "I was too scared to not drink it."

563
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,600
 But you're looking at this concoction that was...

564
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,360
 It's not of this earth.

565
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,480
 He takes a drink of it because he's afraid of what will happen if he doesn't.

566
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,280
 One of the interesting connections between UFO lore and fairy lore, faith folk lore,

567
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,280
 is that you're never supposed to eat or drink any of the food that the fairies gave you.

568
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,560
 If you did that, you would never be able to leave their kingdom.

569
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,560
 And I think that's something that a lot of kids hear from those old fairy tales and that

570
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,200
 might have been something that was going through Ben's head when he was given this drink.

571
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 I mean, at the very least, I mean, maybe you won't be trapped in a fairy circle, but it

572
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,280
 could just be poisonous, right?

573
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,680
 It could just be toxic.

574
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,320
 You're in a place not from your planet.

575
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,480
 This little woman's handing you a drink, but he drinks it.

576
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,320
 Immediately passes out.

577
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,560
 When he comes to, he's just laying on the floor.

578
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,800
 He's laying on the metal floor of this UFO.

579
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,360
 They never got him to a bed or anything like that.

580
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,400
 He's just laying on the floor.

581
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,040
 And the two dudes who found him in the desert are still standing next to him, but they're

582
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,280
 not guarding him.

583
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,320
 They actually seem to be ignoring him.

584
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,600
 Ben sits up and he looks around and he's looking at all these other humanoids on the ship,

585
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,080
 all the little females walking around, and he gets the sense that he is no longer welcome

586
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,320
 there.

587
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,080
 He gets the sense that he failed some sort of test.

588
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:13,400
 Some sort of analysis was done on him and he was not suitable for their purposes.

589
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,960
 That was the feeling he got as he's getting off the floor.

590
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,200
 He was rejected for some reason.

591
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,160
 We covered a story like that at the end of season 17 as well.

592
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,000
 And that story we do see, it's not super common, but we do see it in UFO lore where people

593
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
 almost get abducted and the aliens go, "Well, you don't meet our requirements."

594
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
 They leave them there.

595
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,640
 And normally the people who go through that, they feel kind of bad.

596
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,400
 I mean, it's one thing to get rejected by a girl you really like, but imagine if an alien

597
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,600
 civilization friends owned you.

598
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 It would be even worse.

599
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,960
 But Ben, he's getting up off the ground and the two soldiers, the two guards, whatever

600
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,640
 they were, the two explorers who picked him up in the first place, they seem to just kind

601
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,240
 of be ignoring him.

602
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,760
 And the rest of the crew seems to be ignoring him and he just has this feeling that he failed

603
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,080
 one of their tests and they're letting him go.

604
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,240
 It's interesting, he instinctively knows where the exit of the ship is.

605
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,160
 And it's just a wall that in a second a door is going to materialize and he'll be able

606
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,520
 to walk outside of the ship.

607
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:26,640
 He gets up and he begins walking towards the exit and he stops because he sees something

608
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,200
 that turns this story completely on its head.

609
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,320
 Everything I've said right now, very, very interesting UFO story, a man getting abducted

610
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,760
 and failing a test.

611
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,040
 I like to say we covered that at the end of last season.

612
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,920
 I find that very interesting because we have to ask what are the tests?

613
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,560
 What are the reasons why people are getting abducted and some do and some don't?

614
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,240
 Some seem to have kind encounters with aliens, some people go missing forever.

615
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,680
 And so just on the story that I've told you so far is fascinating in and of itself, but

616
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,600
 as Ben is leaving the ship, it goes from being a fascinating exploration of UFO human contact

617
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,560
 to downright terrifying.

618
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,360
 Ben turns right before he gets to the wall of the ship where the exit will be and he

619
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,440
 looks and there's a cage there.

620
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:30,600
 He sees a cage and inside this cage are two human girls based on his estimates.

621
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,840
 One of them is nine and one of them is around 12 years old.

622
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,880
 He says they're 100% human, they're wearing human clothing, they have human features,

623
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,920
 they're not hybrids or anything like that and he's staring at them and they are standing

624
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:56,880
 in this cage in some sort of trance.

625
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,200
 He's looking at them, they're staring past him.

626
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,960
 Their eyes completely glazed over.

627
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
 They are prisoners.

628
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,480
 As he's staring at these girls, as he's trying to process what he's looking at, the wall

629
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,320
 of the ship opens up and he's just a few steps away from stepping out of this vehicle back

630
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,320
 onto the dry soil of Australia.

631
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,800
 He's looking at these two young girls and he turns and he steps off that ship and he

632
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,040
 is now standing in an empty desert.

633
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:45,760
 The ship is gone, the aliens are gone, the girls are gone.

634
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,560
 Ben walks back to his car where the girl that he had driven out there tells him very quickly

635
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,320
 he had been gone for an hour and a half longer than he should have been.

636
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,880
 Not including the walk time, he walked out to that area to find him but an hour and a

637
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,880
 half had passed since the two men showed up, he was on the vehicle, passed out and now

638
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,040
 he's back in the desert.

639
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,160
 You have to want, there's so many ways to wrap up the end of this story.

640
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,880
 One, when I thought about this story, what would you do?

641
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,920
 Not if you were in the cage right and you're like, oh I'd be catatonic.

642
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,440
 Uh, no, what would you do if you got abducted by aliens?

643
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,880
 Let's even leave the aliens out of this.

644
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,400
 Let's say you were walking down the street one night and you saw a van drive by.

645
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,800
 You see a kid get kidnapped and you have the power to save them?

646
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
 Would you do it?

647
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,920
 Like if I was walking by and some guy's like, get in here little girl and he grabs my wine

648
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,600
 laugh and just, I just imagine this is a totally cartoonish guy.

649
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,600
 He has like a snidely whiplash outfit on.

650
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
 I'm walking down the street, I'm drinking my morning coffee and this dude jumps out and

651
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 goes, come here little girl and he grabs the little girl and I have the power.

652
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,440
 I'm like, stop, people do her.

653
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
 I smash his car and he's like, oh no, I have two more payments and that car was paid off.

654
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,160
 And I'm able to save the little girl.

655
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
 Yeah, totally.

656
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
 Of course I would do that, right?

657
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,800
 If I was walking down the street and I saw like a bunch of like gangsters and they're

658
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,080
 like cartoon villains, they're actual villains.

659
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,040
 They're like, they're known to run this area and kill all witnesses and they're grabbing

660
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,040
 a little girl.

661
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,880
 I'm like, I turn around and walk the other way.

662
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
 I think it's so funny.

663
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,560
 I constantly talk about on this show how I don't, I do not mess with organized crime

664
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
 at all.

665
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,400
 I'm always like, whatever, because it's totally not worth it, right?

666
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,360
 I know that probably people are probably like, you coward.

667
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,640
 But here's the thing, I'm not going to get into the whole organized crime thing, but

668
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,240
 so on a UFO, right?

669
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,640
 Like it'd be one thing if you saw like a cryptid coming out of the bushes and grabbing a singular

670
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,320
 girl, you're like crotty chopping, you're crotty chopping the Chupacabra kicking it in

671
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,760
 the nuts.

672
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:07,800
 But when it's a, you're on a UFO, if you're on a UFO and you saw a bunch of girls or two

673
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,280
 girls trapped, you can't do anything about that.

674
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,520
 Like, what are you going to do?

675
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,440
 You turn around, first off, you just knocked you unconscious, right?

676
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
 What are you going to do?

677
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,920
 Like I feel really bad for this guy.

678
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,600
 Feel bad for the girls as well, but I feel bad for this guy because he had to spend the

679
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,880
 rest of his life dealing with this.

680
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 He might even still be alive.

681
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 I don't know.

682
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,680
 The story took place in 1974, but it's like, what are you going to, what are you realistically

683
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
 going to do?

684
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,720
 Are you going to turn around and let the girls go and then you start fighting the aliens?

685
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,960
 Like, sure they're three feet tall.

686
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,360
 Like you could pick up a couple of them, could probably take a couple of these dudes, but

687
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,880
 they aren't an interdimensional spacecraft.

688
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,960
 You don't even know the scope of their technology.

689
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
 Could you free these girls?

690
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,760
 I would, once again, putting my cowardice on full display.

691
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
 I don't think it's cowardice.

692
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,920
 I think it's just being logical.

693
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:14,200
 If I saw two girls kidnapped by aliens, I'd be like, I hope I'm with a good alien kidnapping.

694
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,600
 I hope it's none of the creepy alien kidnapping.

695
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,520
 And then I jump out of the ship and I land.

696
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
 I'm waving.

697
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,240
 I guess I don't have to rub it in.

698
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 I'm having fun as I jump out of the ship.

699
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 Wee.

700
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,680
 They have an inflatable slide as you go out of their interdimensional vehicle.

701
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,360
 I wouldn't be like doing a touchdown dance when I got outside in your face, little girls.

702
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,840
 But yeah, what would you do?

703
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,440
 Like I actually feel bad for this dude because to walk past kidnapped kids, which is really

704
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,000
 what this is, right?

705
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,160
 These kids got kidnapped and you're walking past them and you can't save them.

706
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
 That's utterly terrifying.

707
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,320
 It's as many jokes as I told during that whole thing.

708
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,560
 And again, at a certain point, you have to be logical.

709
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,960
 And I'm wondering if you had someone who was less logical and more like, oh, I'm going

710
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
 to save these girls.

711
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,760
 They totally get toasted by these aliens.

712
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
 And then you'd have three missing people instead of just two.

713
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,520
 That girl would be back at the car and be like, oh, where'd my boyfriend go?

714
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,080
 And then how would she actually-- he has the car keys.

715
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,520
 His car keys are in the ninth dimension.

716
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,160
 She's like, oh, no, I have to walk home.

717
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
 What's going on?

718
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
 It sucks.

719
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
 But you know what?

720
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
 So you have all that.

721
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
 You have all that.

722
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
 I feel bad for the dude.

723
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
 I feel bad for the girls.

724
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,600
 That should go without saying, but I feel bad for the dude because how do you walk past kidnapped

725
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,000
 children and know you're powerless to save them?

726
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,400
 And it's not like you can even go home and call the cops and the cops could go and rescue

727
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,560
 the kids because the aliens took them.

728
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,160
 I guess you could report the kids missing so the parents could find them.

729
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,440
 Look at these kids were dropped back off at their parents' house.

730
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
 I don't know.

731
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,520
 But they just spent a couple hours in a cage under a trance.

732
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,680
 It's still going to be traumatizing.

733
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,200
 Absolutely fascinating phenomenon.

734
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,440
 The story of a young man walking out to a desert.

735
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,360
 It really has all the hallmarks of a missing person mystery, right?

736
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,960
 This man was abducted, disappeared in the wilderness of Australia and came back.

737
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,520
 And instead of bringing a story of alien brotherhood and cosmic communication, he brings back a

738
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,400
 story of missing children.

739
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,640
 Two young girls trapped aboard an alien craft, locked behind metal bars.

740
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,680
 Their minds broken.

741
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:45,520
 How many people from Earth yearly end up in the clutches of alien hands and they cannot

742
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
 hope for escape?

743
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,560
 The only thing you could hope for is that your psyche becomes so shattered, that your

744
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,400
 brain becomes so broken.

745
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:59,000
 You cannot imagine the torments that await you.

746
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,960
 The only thing you can hope for is that you are catatonic.

747
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:13,040
 So you cannot truly comprehend what the end of your life will be like at the hands of

748
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:22,160
 these alien madmen.

749
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,600
