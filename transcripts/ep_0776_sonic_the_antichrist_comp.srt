1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 What would you do if you finally met the woman of your dreams?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,120
 And then we travel to Lisbon, Portugal to take a look at an extraordinary event that

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,680
 has us ask the question, are fictional characters the Antichrist today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,280
 [music]

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,160
 having a happy whatever day you're listening to this. It could be 3000 AD, who knows, but I hope

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,680
 you guys are having an awesome fight against the Zentradi in the future. As we're watching the

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,280
 future war unfold, in comes today's Legacy Patreon supporter. Give it up for Adam Carter.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,160
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Adam Carter coming in, cartwheeling into

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,720
 Dead Rabbit Command. I'm sure he hears that joke all the time. It's like no, no one has ever

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,800
 confused Carter with a cartwheel. Adam, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that. Just helps read the word about

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
 the show. That really, really helps out a lot. You have no idea how much it helps getting the word out.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,720
 Adam, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit robot. We're gonna leave behind

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:29,200
 Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna row all the way out to Poland. Splash, splash, oh I have to come

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,240
 up with a better sound effect for that one. But Adam is brilliantly guiding us out to Poland.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,880
 Specifically, we're going to Swinno Juicy Poland, and we're going back to some olden times in

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,680
 Swinno Juicy. We're talking like pre 1848. So by the time we get there, the world's all CP atone.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,360
 It's like log cabins and I don't know a bunch of geese probably running around the town. They just

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,000
 elected a geese as mayor and he's bringing in his people. We're in Swinno Juicy and there are these

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,720
 two farm workers and they share a room and it's like the whole house is just one room. Imagine

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,040
 this like a fairy tale, but it's not. I'm not reading fairy tales again. Even though the story

24
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,920
 will sound like a fairy tale, just hold on. They're in like a gingerbread house. They're in

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
 a gingerbread house and the roommates are constantly eating the walls. Ah, we've been exposed to the

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,320
 elements. The big bad wolf is going to blow it down now. They're in like one room shack and

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,520
 that would suck, right? Having roommates isn't the funnest thing in the world. Imagine if there

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,680
 were no walls between you. You're just all laying in this house together and it's even worse because

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:46,000
 one of the guys, we're going to name him Tommy, Tommy is plagued with horrible nightmares. So,

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,360
 get off of me. Ah, the geese, the geese, not again. No. And in this time period, they called them

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,520
 marts. Maybe the tea was silent, but it doesn't matter how they pronounce them. They were nightmares

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,600
 and they actually saw it as the version of like the old hack. So what it is is a nightmare wasn't

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,680
 just you having a horrible dream. Something was coming into your house and sitting on your chest

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
 and making it hard for you to breathe and giving you these horrible visions. So, you know, like,

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,800
 just all that basic old hag type of mythology. This happens every night and Joe's like, "Bro,

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
 we got to work on the farm tomorrow. Can you please stop screaming at the top of your lungs

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,120
 at three in the morning?" "But that's the spookiest time," Tommy says. What's happened so often?

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
 That finally they get together and they're like, "We have to catch this." Because they're thinking

39
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,720
 that the nightmare is a physical entity or at least some sort of energy they can control.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
 Nowadays, if you have nightmares and your roommate goes, "Did you try catching it?"

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
 You're getting a new roommate. But back then, the other guy goes, "Oh, that's a great idea.

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,800
 Why didn't I think about catching my nightmares?" So what they do is they come up with this plan.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,440
 Tommy goes, "Okay, the next time I'm asleep, when you hear me moaning,

44
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,200
 I'm asleep. If I'm just laying in bed with the covers over my body, don't do it then.

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,320
 But if I'm actually asleep, it's your cue to jump up and cover up the knot hole in the door."

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,880
 That's how old this house was, that you just have holes in your house. You try to get like a door.

47
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,840
 If you were really rich, your door had no holes in it. But this one is like, "So you're going to jump up,

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
 you're going to plug the knot hole in the door because I bet you have this nightmare.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,480
 I bet you that's how this nightmare is getting in here. And then wake me up. Wake me up and

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,680
 I'll grab onto the nightmare." And Joe's like, "That is foolproof. How did we not think of that?

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,200
 Also, we should just plug the hole in the door anyways. Let's just do that. Not gonna be better

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,520
 if we captured this nightmare." So what happens is, of course, that night, he starts having this

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,160
 nightmare again and Joe, he runs and he plugs the hole up in the door. And then the dude,

54
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,080
 Tommy, wakes up and he can feel the forces. He's grabbing onto something. "Oh, you're not getting

55
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
 away from me. He's grabbing on to me. He's grabbing on to me. He can feel it. Try to leave." But he

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,920
 won't let go and then eventually he feels the energy kind of dissipate and he realizes it must

57
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,080
 be gone. We must have caught it, but maybe it got away. So homeboys, so the two dudes fall back

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,600
 asleep, right? Because what else are you going to do after you've struggled with the supernatural

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,640
 entity that broke into your house? You still got to get your Zs. The next morning though, they wake up

60
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
 and they hear something in the house. "What, huh? What's going on?" It just woke up.

61
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:52,640
 They see a beautiful woman crouched down behind their stove. Oh, geez. A little peek of blonde hair

62
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,520
 sticking out there. I'm assuming because they said she was attractive, so of course she's a blonde,

63
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,000
 right? She's looking out, looking out. And they're like, they look at each other and they realize

64
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:14,080
 this must be the nightmare. So they get up and they're like, "Hey, we know that you've been

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,840
 breaking our house all this time and giving me nightmares. Is that true?" And she says, "Okay,

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,400
 listen. As crazy as this is going to sound, I am the physical manifestation of a nightmare,

67
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,000
 but before you guys do something absolutely horrible to me, I'm a human. I'm an actual,

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,840
 like, normal human girl who got turned into a nightmare." And Tommy and Joey kind of look at

69
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,200
 each other and go, "Oh, that makes sense." Because the lore, again, if someone said that to you

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,320
 today, he'd send them off to the loony bin. But the lore states that there are different ways that

71
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:57,360
 a human can become a nightmare. If a human is born on a Sunday and... I didn't finish writing the

72
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,560
 sentence in my notes. All it says is... Okay. In my notes, it says, "If a human is born on Sunday

73
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,080
 and their eyebrows, they become a nightmare." I don't know exactly what their eyebrows are

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,880
 supposed to do. You're like, "Jason, that's your only job is to research this stuff." I think it's

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,120
 if their eyebrows... It's one of the two. If their eyebrows touch or if they have no eyebrows. I'm

76
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,920
 pretty sure I was supposed to have written, "If a human is born on Sunday and they have a unibrow,

77
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,640
 then they can become a nightmare." You can also... If you're one of the seven... If your family has

78
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,480
 seven boys in a row and you're the seventh boy, you might become a nightmare. And the same thing is

79
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,840
 there are seven girls. You're the seventh girl in the nightmare. You're the seventh girl in a row.

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,480
 You could become a nightmare. There's all these different ways to do it. So she goes to that.

81
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,920
 One of those happened to me. She goes, "My eyebrows." They look at each other and they

82
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,520
 nod. They're like, "Oh, yeah, the eyebrows. You do have those eyebrows." And they wink because

83
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,240
 they know the secret. Now that they've established that this young beautiful maiden is a nightmare,

84
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,440
 but she's actually human, now the most important thing between these two gentlemen comes up. Who

85
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,280
 gets her? Because at the end of the day, they've captured a beautiful woman. As horrible as that

86
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,120
 is, that's the way they're looking at it. They're like, "Well, we have this captive. Who gets to marry

87
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,240
 her?" So they start fighting because the one guy goes, "You will... You know, she plagued me night

88
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,040
 after night for a long time. I had these horrible visions of death and misery." And then finally,

89
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,760
 I grabbed onto her and held onto her so tight that the ethereal energy of her was not able to

90
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,560
 leave my grasp. And I brought her to this reality. And Joey knows I put up some cotton in a hole.

91
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,680
 So I should get her. And the guy's always like, "No, no, you didn't even have any nightmares."

92
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,800
 So they fought over this girl. I'll put you through that, not whole Joey. If you keep complaining.

93
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,040
 So he married this girl. We'll call her Elizabeth. So he marries Elizabeth the Nightmare and they

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,720
 end up having children, which now Joey must really feel like the odd man out because now he's

95
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,560
 basically just living with his family. And it says in the story, this German folktale,

96
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
 quote, "They had children and lived together quite happily."

97
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,960
 Unquote. And I thought, "Huh? What? Like, she's trapped. Like, she's still in servitude, right?

98
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,040
 At a certain point, she's trapped." And you go, "Well, maybe they went on day trips and maybe they

99
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,080
 went to see the site. Maybe they toured plague-ridden Europe." Who knows? But she was happy. But every

100
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,280
 day, the victor writes the story, right? Because Tommy's like, "Oh, dude, no, she's totally cool."

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,600
 Every single day though, she goes, "Hey, Tommy, I was wondering, could you show me where that

102
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
 knot hole was that you plugged up with the thing?" Remember that whole time when you pulled me out

103
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,840
 of the shadow realm and you plugged up that hole? Can you show me where that's at? And Tommy'd be like,

104
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,560
 "Nah, it's maybe tomorrow, but I'm kind of tired right now." He's like sitting two feet from it.

105
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,480
 He's like, you can easily point at it. He's like, "I've been working. My arm's hurt. Let's go have

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
 more kids." And every single day she'd go, "Can I... I was wondering if you could show me that knot hole?

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,280
 Hey, Joey, remember you and me used to hang out?" He's like, "What? We never hung out. You're just my

108
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,920
 friend's wife." And he goes, "Oh, I still think you're pretty cool. Can you show me where that

109
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,520
 knot hole is?" And Joey's like, "Nah, I don't really feel comfortable with that." If she's constantly

110
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,320
 asking... If she's constantly... If every single day she's asking for something that pertains to the

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,920
 way she was captured, I don't think you can include the line, "She was quite happily living with him."

112
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,440
 Anyways, after a long time of this, and I don't know if she ever left the shack.

113
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
 I don't know if her kids were basically like, gave babies and they never saw the sun.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,360
 I'm imagining they did, but she needed to have that knot hole released.

115
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,200
 And she kept pushing and pushing, and then one day she goes, "Listen, I can hear my mom calling for me.

116
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,240
 I can hear my mom calling for me. She's in England and she wants me. And if you just show me the

117
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,600
 knot hole, maybe that'll make her stop." And she's still going on about this knot hole. She's had

118
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
 like four kids at this point. She's still going on about the knot hole. And Tommy finally goes,

119
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,640
 "You know what? Tell you what? I'll show you where the knot hole is." And he points to it,

120
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,160
 and she instantly flies out of the knot hole and is never seen again. And now Tommy's raised.

121
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,080
 He's a single dad. With these kids, he became a sitcom on Fox. It's a folk tale. It's a German

122
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,600
 folk tale. It's interesting. I don't know what the lesson is supposed to be about it. It's from

123
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,760
 a book called North German Saga's Fairy Tales and Customs. And I don't really know, is the moral of

124
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,240
 the story not to wrestle with your nightmares? Is it to not... I think the moral of the story is,

125
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
 don't tell women where the hole is in your door, because they might fly out of it. But I don't

126
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,360
 know how applicable that is in the modern times, because at the end he just became a single dad.

127
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
 He has all these kids now. He's like, "No, but I think when I read this story, I thought,

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:08,160
 what if you could bang a nightmare? Like, what if you could have sex?" And I'm not talking about sex

129
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,680
 with a ghost. I'm not even talking about succubus or incubus or anything like that. Like, what if

130
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,960
 you could have sex with a nightmare? That's actually the most normal thing I'm about to say.

131
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,680
 And then let's say that that nightmare has children. Oh, you know what? That's so abstract.

132
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,440
 Let's think of it like, let's say you bang a ghost. This will make it a little more believable.

133
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
 You're banging a ghost. A ghost is coming to your house every night. It's getting kind of frisky.

134
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,280
 First you're sitting there watching television. You feel a little hand on your knee. And then

135
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,720
 when you're taking a shower, you feel like fingertips on your back. You think it's just

136
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,280
 the water going down your back, but it's not. It's fingertips. And then you get into bed and you see

137
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,560
 like the covers move. You think it's just a horrible cockroach infestation. But you throw the

138
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,320
 covers up and there's only three cockroaches. You go, "I saw more movement than that." And it's

139
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,320
 really this ghost, this frisky ghost, and eventually you're doing the horizontal macarena with a ghost.

140
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:13,200
 And then the ghost has babies, human babies, indistinguishable from other humans. What then?

141
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,560
 Like, is it an interesting question? That's just you making up. That might be the most

142
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
 ludicrous thing. In fact, Jason, I think you actually did an episode

143
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,160
 making fun of a woman who had a ghost baby. I think I did too. But if you could have a

144
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,720
 sex with a nightmare, we'll go back to that one because I did totally to Swiss ghost babies a

145
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
 long time ago. If we talk about having sex with a nightmare, what would that do? What I really

146
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,120
 want to get at is what would that do to the human DNA? What would that do to that lineage? Like,

147
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,880
 that dude now has four kids who are the very, very best or half British and are the very,

148
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:03,680
 very worst or half nightmare. Their eyebrows must be all messed up. And this is just one of those

149
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,360
 weird stories because when we think there are so many stories throughout human history that are

150
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,000
 about deities, being in humans. This is pretty much the entire Greek mythology is about gods,

151
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,600
 banging people. And even when you break that story down, and it's a story of two dudes in a cabin,

152
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,280
 and a girl shows up from the nightmare realm, they're still banging her and producing offspring.

153
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:42,160
 Is there something in the human ancestral mind where we constantly are talking about,

154
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,640
 not constantly, it's not on the view all the time, but it's something that sparks your interest. It's

155
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:58,720
 half human beings. Like, what is it about that? Like, that is such a common trope. Even before

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,160
 stories were a thing, that was a cliche. Even before things were being written down and narrative

157
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,600
 structures were being formed. That was a thing. Half human, half spiritual, whether that's a

158
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,160
 nightmare, whether that's a god, whether that's a nephilim, however you say it, it's so ingrained

159
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:30,160
 into human culture. And I think that, what would that do to the human DNA if this stuff was possible?

160
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,920
 Would it be distinguishable? If you were, if this was a true story and you were able to find

161
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,360
 the ancestors of these kids, would you be able to tell or because it's so magical and interdimensional,

162
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,520
 it would look like human DNA? Or is there a segment of society that is half Atlantean? At

163
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,960
 this point, there'd be like one, one thousandth Atlantean, but you know what I mean? Like,

164
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:58,640
 what would be the ramifications of having these people who are half nightmare, half human?

165
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,880
 Like, what would it actually do? And that's actually, surprisingly, a great segue that

166
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,160
 whole ramblinness was a great segue for our next segment. Adam, I'm going to go ahead and toss you

167
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,640
 the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Poland. We are headed all the way out

168
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:24,960
 to Portugal. And as we're headed out there, I wanted to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

169
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,520
 It's one of those movies I really can't talk much about. I think the joy is discovering it for

170
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,840
 yourself. I was randomly flipping through Netflix. I came across it. I had no idea what the plot is,

171
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,040
 and I watched it twice in a weekend. I really, really enjoyed this movie. It's called The History

172
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:51,040
 of Future Folk. Some people describe it as a comedy. I would describe it as a drama with jokes.

173
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,240
 I would actually describe it as a documentary. I'm almost thinking this movie is real,

174
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,560
 because as brilliant as this movie is, no one in it went on to do any other film. I'm wondering,

175
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:09,600
 like, is this a true story? It's so bizarre. It's so fun. It's not dark. It's not spooky. It's just a

176
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,960
 really, really, really well-made movie. It's the most whimsical movie you'll ever watch

177
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,320
 that is about a flesh eating virus. That plays a part in the film. So, really, I recommend checking

178
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,840
 out The History of Future Folk, and just put it on. You will enjoy it. It's on Netflix. That's

179
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,960
 what I saw it on. It's on. It came out back in 2013, so it's an older movie. But Dead Rabbit

180
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,240
 recommends The History of Future Folk. We're headed to Lisbon, Portugal. It's September 17th,

181
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,360
 1680. It's 1130 in the morning. And I want to give a shout out to just a random internet user guy

182
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,680
 named SoulDrifter. He compiled all of this really cool information on a website. It's a forum called

183
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,360
 AlienExpans.com, and he did some really cool work. So, thanks, SoulDrifter, for getting all this stuff

184
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,680
 put together. September 17th, 1680. We're in Lisbon, Portugal. And the city is just, you know,

185
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,960
 doing its thing. The geese takeover has begun there as well. There's geese. There's a couple

186
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,640
 chickens. They're the rowdy ones you got to look out for. And then the people just kind of milling

187
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,880
 about town, and then all of a sudden a massive sound cracks across the sky.

188
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:32,320
 Three tongues of flame spew forth. Baaah, baaah, baaah, hitting the ground. Oh no, run! Save the

189
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:41,680
 geese! Lightning begins striking the city. Starting fires. His goose is cooked. So, that's the mayors

190
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,120
 laying there. Oh, save me! A black cloud begins to descend from the sky.

191
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,400
 And from it, thunder echoes across the landscape.

192
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:04,640
 And out of this cloud emerged a huge hairy creature. And they see it, but it's like a blur.

193
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,640
 It's running so fast, they can barely get a glimpse of it, let alone chase it, but people

194
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
 are trying to chase this thing around. The city's in ruins. There's fires. There's still this horrible

195
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,200
 lightning storm. And this monster is running around their fields. They're trying to chase it. They

196
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,160
 can't catch it, but they keep running. And when they would get near it, it would be right in front

197
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
 of them, and then it would be behind them. And then they'd turn around and be in front of them again,

198
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,280
 and then it would start running circles around them so fast they could not make out any details.

199
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:46,560
 This whole event, this whole event leads into a storm, a powerful storm, that hits the city of

200
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:55,280
 Lisbon, and it kills 80 people. This is not a good day to be in Portugal. But this creature,

201
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,360
 who they saw as this omen of this utter destruction of their city,

202
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
 they can never catch a good glimpse of. They could see that he had a pretty big tail on him.

203
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:15,760
 But the thing that really stuck out to them was this creature was blue, white, and red.

204
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:24,640
 It's that Sonic the Hedgehog.

205
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,680
 Sonic the Hedgehog. Now, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me a second. That Sonic the Hedgehog

206
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,880
 came down to Lisbon, Portugal in 1680. He's running around. Now, this story was reported,

207
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,520
 that the Sonic the Hedgehog part was not reported in this book, but there's a book called Wonders in

208
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,480
 the Sky by Jacques Valet. He's a huge UFOologist and Chris Aubuck as well. He wrote this. The creature

209
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,520
 is described as being blue, white, and red. And when I read that and I read how fast he was,

210
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,400
 and he was running around in circles, I thought, Sonic the Hedgehog. Sonic the Hedgehog came to

211
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,520
 Earth. Chris Chan is breaking out of jail right now, just to listen to this episode. Sonic the

212
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,760
 Hedgehog came to Earth in the year 1680 and was running around Portugal. Now, that alone would

213
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,160
 be an interesting topic to talk about. I mean, obviously a fictional character descending the

214
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,000
 planet. Do we know what was Sonic the Hedgehog? No, obviously not. But I wasn't there. But he

215
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,440
 does meet some of the criteria of being Sonic the Hedgehog. But if it was just a story that talked

216
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
 about, and it's a pretty cool story anytime, anytime 80 people die in a city, you know I'm

217
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,400
 gonna cover it. It is a cool story. The idea of this super fast creature is cool. The idea that it

218
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,520
 could be Sonic the Hedgehog is super bizarre. Super bizarre. I can shock valley is not saying that.

219
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,800
 I am. But then and then I thought about it. I thought about it. What if

220
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,000
 fictional characters are the Antichrist?

221
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:09,040
 Let me explain this theory. And what's funny is I have, I've seen this pop up in other places online.

222
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,520
 I'm not the first person to put this together. But this was a story that I would see pop up on

223
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,960
 Reddit or on some forum like, what was the, what's the other one I go to? Not above top secret. I go

224
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,360
 there and I go to God like productions. I see it on God like productions a couple times too.

225
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,480
 Superheroes are predictive programming. So when superheroes really show up, we will bow before

226
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,600
 them. And that conspiracy theory was so nuts. And the people who were talking about it was so nuts.

227
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,080
 I go, there's not really a narrative hook here. If you're going to be insane, it has to be organized

228
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,560
 insanity. We've talked about that, that on this show, but I've seen other people mention that.

229
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,440
 The one I saw specifically on Reddit, I'll see if I can look it up. I actually think it got deleted

230
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,800
 was that when aliens invade, they're going to come in the guise of superhumans. And since we

231
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,280
 already worship superhumans, we'll worship them. I'm taking it a step further. When we're dealing

232
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,760
 with the interdimensional, we kind of talked about this on the Bigfoot episode, but this week,

233
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 but when we're dealing with the interdimensional, the average, the normal laws don't apply.

234
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,080
 I could not walk out of this closet and become Superman. If I put on a Superman costume, I wouldn't

235
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,720
 look like Superman. I would have to work out every day and take human growth hormones and

236
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,760
 you know, get taller, all this stuff just to appear to be like Superman. But if I'm some sort of

237
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:44,080
 interdimensional alien or a demon, I could appear like Superman easily, easily. And if you're already

238
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,880
 demonic, if you already have these infernal powers or you have technology that can mimic

239
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,640
 these things, you could have the superpowers of Superman, right? Think about it this way. Think

240
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,480
 about it this way. Let's say the devil shows up tomorrow, right? He makes his presence known,

241
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,800
 he's at like some sporting event, he's walking around. I guess I'm just described that scene from

242
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,360
 The Dark Knight Rises. Imagine that, but Satan. Satan walks out on the field, he goes, "Citizens

243
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,760
 of Earth, I am Lucifer and you, you sure you guys know me? I'm famous for a lot of stuff around.

244
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,200
 I'm here, I'm taking over the world and all these demons are crawling out of portals.

245
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,960
 People are gonna fight back, right? There might be, there might be a couple weirdos in West

246
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,040
 Memphis that are like, "All right, now's our time to rise." But the rest of us will be like, "Yeah,

247
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,720
 I think even Saint worshipers would be like, "Oh, I didn't know this guy really existed. Ah!"

248
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,840
 We'd all fight back." So that's why the idea of the Antichrist when you read like the Book of

249
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,960
 Revelation or even, the Antichrist is mentioned multiple times in the Bible, but he's also mentioned

250
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,680
 as being there's multiple Antichrists. When you read the Bible, it's not a singular person,

251
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,240
 so that kind of works in my favor. But when you work, look at the story in the Book of Revelation,

252
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,680
 Satan takes the guys as like the new Messiah, right? He's coming down. So I always figured he'd

253
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,120
 show up looking like Jesus, but when it come looking like a monster, right? He'd come looking like a

254
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,400
 Redeemer, like a false prophet. But you would still have people. Now, in the Book of Revelation,

255
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,960
 talks about like, you know, people will be confused and people will worship him and stuff like that.

256
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
 So maybe there is some sort of magical element, like people are getting brainwashed and things

257
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
 like that. But I don't know, nowadays it doesn't seem to take much for people to start going nuts.

258
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,920
 Maybe you don't need magic. But anyways, I think even then, if some dude showed up and he's like,

259
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,160
 I'm the Redeemer of humanity, if some guy showed up to you today and said that, you'd be like,

260
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,480
 what? What are you talking about, man? I'm on my smoke break. Please leave me alone. And if you

261
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 started seeing people talk about that in the media, like all the news outlets are covering this guy

262
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,720
 and he's this big Redeemer, he's the matreah, whatever, you're going to have a sizable chunk

263
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,400
 of humanity that goes, I not only don't trust him, but I don't trust you because you believe in him

264
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,280
 so easily. So I'm not only going to fight against him, I'm going to fight against you. So you want

265
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,160
 to have a united front. You want to have all humans united against this demon, because it looks like

266
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,400
 a demon in the first example. Now you'd have humanity split in half. And you'd have people

267
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,240
 of different religions fighting together against this guy who's claiming to be the Redeemer because

268
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,000
 he's interfering either with their economic interests or their spiritual interests or what.

269
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,800
 It'd be like any other world leader that's tried taking over, but this dude has magic and

270
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,520
 can turn into a seven-headed dragon. That's in the book of Revelation. But what if you could avoid

271
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,560
 the war altogether? This is what I'm talking about here. I'm watching this television show called

272
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:40,800
 Oz. It's about prisons. Prisons. It's from the 90s. I'm from the late 90s. There's a scene in it.

273
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,920
 There's a young man in a wheelchair and he's been drug-free for about two years and he meets

274
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:52,080
 his idol, his basketball idol, this basketball player who's now also in Oz. He beat up his girlfriend

275
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,960
 or something like that. And the basketball guy is doing drugs. And this young man who's one of the

276
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,120
 protagonist of the show, and there's not many because it's about prison. It's about corrupt police

277
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,760
 and corrupt prisoners and how hats hang on heads and all sorts of crazy stuff. The basketball star

278
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,000
 is doing drugs and he offers some to the guy in the wheelchair who we know now. We've known him for

279
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,800
 quite a few episodes and he's kind of a moral center. And he goes, "Dude, do some drugs." And the

280
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,640
 guy in the wheelchair goes, "No, I'm good." And he's like, "Do some drugs. Do it. Do it. Come on, man."

281
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,680
 This young man in this wheelchair who's in prison for killing a cop. He's one of the moral centers

282
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:37,600
 of the show again, by the way. He starts doing drugs. And it's so interesting because I'm watching

283
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,680
 that scene and I thought in another television show he would have rolled away in his wheelchair.

284
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,760
 That would have been it. And he would have had a moral victory. And we would have seen a difference

285
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,280
 between him and the other prisoners of Oz. But he started doing the drugs and I'm sitting there

286
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:02,080
 and I, my mind's processing this. And I thought that, imagine if your hero, because he goes on

287
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,640
 and on and on. He idolizes guy. He idolizes basketball player. He's supposed to be like this

288
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,040
 Michael Jordan level player scored 58 points in a single game. And now he's in your neighborhood.

289
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:21,760
 In this case, you're in prison. Imagine if your hero wanted you to do something you knew was wrong.

290
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,160
 Nothing serious. Not go on and kill anyone. Not go on and torture anyone. Just, you know what?

291
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:38,480
 Maybe have that drink. Have that smoke. Cheat on your wife. Whatever. Your hero says it.

292
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:48,240
 So we don't get taken over by a demonic entity. We don't get taken over by a religious entity.

293
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:58,800
 We get taken over by something disguising itself as our heroes. Spider-Man, Superman,

294
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:07,680
 the Flash, whatever. And that would be universal. You're not going to have everyone believe in the

295
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,240
 Marvel or the DC guys, right? You may have people in other countries who have regional heroes.

296
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,080
 Well, they show up too. I made that joke earlier about Christian. We did a whole episode on the

297
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,840
 dimensional merge and eventually all the fictional worlds are going to collide with ours and it'll

298
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,840
 be this paradise. As long as you don't live in Gotham City. What if that is how the world ends?

299
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,040
 Not in the field in Israel known as Armageddon, but on every street corner in the world.

300
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,960
 We merge with the fictional. We love our heroes. We love our stories.

301
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:51,200
 We tell these tales of heroics. These fictional characters seem real.

302
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,320
 You might be able to fight against a human adversary. You might be able to fight against a

303
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,040
 demonic adversary, but would you be willing to go to war with the heroes you grew up with?

304
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,840
 It'd be a lot harder. You may question, I think it's super weird that all of a sudden the fictional

305
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,160
 world is real. That's fine. You would question that, but would you instinctively try to pick up a gun

306
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,760
 or a pulse rifle or whatever weapon was lying around in this now fictionalized world to take out

307
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:33,280
 Daredevil or Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny? You'd hug them. We have entire theme parks dedicated

308
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,480
 to taking the fictional and making it real just so you can hug them. Take pictures with them.

309
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:47,280
 The perfect way to win a war is for your opponent not to even realize the war is taking place.

310
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:56,800
 The forces of darkness are truly as smart as we think they are, as clever, as deceptive

311
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:05,200
 as we've all heard. They will not come in their true form. They won't even come in the form

312
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:14,880
 that everyone's expecting. You look at the book of Revelation. They would come not as a redeemer,

313
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:24,480
 but as a friend. What they appear is someone that nobody knew who has all these miraculous powers

314
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,080
 and has to convince the world to bow before him or would Lucifer and his host of demons all just

315
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:38,160
 take the forms of these fictional characters and inhabit our world and we love them already. We love

316
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,040
 them when we look at the page or on the screen. We'd love them more if they stood next to us.

317
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:51,360
 And once we are all in the thrall of these means, once we have all submitted our hearts and our

318
00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:01,520
 minds to our fictional friends made real, that, that is when the slaughter begins.

319
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:08,880
 That is when we are enslaved. That is when we are broken.

320
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:20,800
 They do have that old saying. The worst thing about heroes is meeting them in real life.
