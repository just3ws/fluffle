1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 Are left-handed people better at killing?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,920
 We take a look at an island paradise ruled by pirates.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,440
 And then we take a look at Oregon's own Crater Lake.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,720
 What mysteries lie beneath the mysterious blue impossibly deep water?

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
 We'll find out. We'll guess today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,480
 [Music]

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,120
 Hey everyone. Welcome back to another- I'm gonna start doing- Hey!

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,840
 I didn't notice you there. My name's Jason.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,440
 That'll be my new interest starting this- starting season four.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,360
 But for now, hey everyone. Um, what was my intro again? Dammit.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,080
 We're gonna start this episode off with something that I don't think I've done before.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,560
 Even though I probably should have multiple times.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,680
 We're gonna start it off with the correction. And this is the reason why.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,360
 Yesterday's episode with the Brazilian- uh, this Bunchbuff Squarepants defecation Brazilian broadcast.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,080
 I- I said twice. I go, "Listen, I'm just reading news articles about the water quality over there.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,800
 I have a lot of listeners in Brazil and I have friends in Brazil."

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
 I said, "If I'm wrong, let me know."

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,920
 Because I've learned my lesson as an old man that a lot of times news articles will hype stuff up.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,680
 I got a YouTube comment today from a YouTube user named Bruno Profeta and he clarified it.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,040
 He said that the water there was polluted because of illegal dumping.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,840
 And that was the water that was being used for the Olympic sports.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,960
 He said the tap water that we drink doesn't have raw sewage in it.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,760
 So, and- and I figured, like, I figured that.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,440
 That was the thing is I was reading the articles.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,320
 They made it sound to be the super dire, horrible water catastrophe down there.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,760
 And he clarified that for me.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,840
 So, I wanted to make sure that I got that out.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 And again, I kind of figured that.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,080
 As far as the conspiracy goes, if you believe that the Bunchbuff Squarepants defecation Brazilian broadcast is real,

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,600
 it could still have been a stomach virus and it was covered by the government or the biological warfare weapon or whatever.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,520
 But I just wanted to clarify that the drinking water over there, for the most part, is as clean as other countries.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,320
 The news articles are making it sound like it was just like you turn on the faucet and black sledge came out.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,880
 But, you know the media, they love to hype stuff up.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,480
 Okay, so let's go ahead.

38
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,800
 And was there any other information I had?

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,320
 I'm still just watching Star Trek.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,760
 I gotta admit, I gotta admit, man, I met work today and I was like,

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,960
 "Dude, I can't wait till I get home and can watch your worst Star Trek."

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,280
 And I'm like, "Dude, this is not good for the show."

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,000
 He should be like, "I can't wait to get home to work on the show."

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
 But I do love myself some Star Trek.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,040
 Okay, first story comes from the magical year of 2004 as we delve back into the mystery of new news.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,160
 So, it's 2004, this study came out.

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,720
 And what happened were the scientists were shitting around in their lab coats, going,

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,960
 "You know what? Left-handed people are better at sports."

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,560
 And the scientists were like, "What sports?"

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,280
 And the main scientist was like, "It's something we don't do."

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,520
 But, remember those guys you picked on you in high school?

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,560
 They were like, "Yeah, I remember."

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,280
 They played sports.

54
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,240
 Oh, okay.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,800
 So, left-handed people are better at sports.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,120
 The scientists, the lead scientist says,

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,040
 he goes, "I wonder if they're better at combat as well.

58
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,360
 I wonder if there's an evolutionary advantage to being left-handed.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,120
 And that's why it has lasted all these millennias."

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
 Is it millennia?

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,640
 Is that plural by itself?

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,200
 I think it is.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,280
 So, and the other scientists get mad at him because he mispronounced the scientific word.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
 He gets rushed out of the room and he's like,

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,600
 "Oh, I thought the bullying was over when I left high school."

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,960
 But anyway, so the study looked at this idea that do our left-handed people better at combat.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,880
 Now, you can't organize just like the righties versus the lefties

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,920
 and like this mass melee in the middle of Milan.

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,960
 Hey, you like that?

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,280
 There you go.

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,560
 If you like word play.

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,240
 Okay, so I was very proud of myself, but I did that if you can't tell.

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 They couldn't do that.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,240
 So, what they had to do is look at murder rates.

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,440
 Look at homicide rates of countries to see if there's correlation

76
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,640
 between left-handed people murdering more than right-handed people.

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
 So, what they thought of was this.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,400
 In D'Ola of Burkina D'Oso, and I get it.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,600
 I don't know where the place is either, but I think D'Ola is a city.

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,560
 It may be a region, but I still have no idea where Burkini.

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,840
 I probably should have researched it.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,200
 Burkina D'Oso is 3.4% of the population is left-handed,

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,360
 and their murder rate is 0.013 per 1,000 people.

84
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,880
 So, they're like, "Oh, okay, that proves it, right?"

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 And they're like, "No, no, we have to compare it against something."

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,280
 The scientists are like, "Damn it, gotta do more work."

87
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,960
 So, they go to Ipoh of Indonesia, where 27% of the people there are left-handed.

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,880
 So, a huge difference.

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,280
 You have over a quarter of the people are left-handed.

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
 Their cars don't work.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,560
 Everyone's really good at baseball.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,680
 There's over 25% of the population is left-handed.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,240
 There, it's 3 murders per 1,000 people.

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,160
 So, a vast vast...

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,320
 You figure, I'm not gonna do the math for you,

96
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,120
 but the 27% versus the 3%, but 0.013 versus 3 murders.

97
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
 A huge vast vast difference.

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,760
 Wait, is that vast?

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
 I can't...

100
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,200
 0.13 by times that by...

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,120
 It would take 3 to get it up to 39,

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,080
 and then another 3 to get it up to 99.

103
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,760
 So, that would be 6 times.

104
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,520
 That would get it up to 1, and then you'd have to times it by 3.

105
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 So, that's an 18%.

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,800
 That's like an 18-fold increase, I believe.

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,320
 18-fold increase of murders in a town with the lowest population of left-handed people,

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,040
 versus the highest population of left-handed people.

109
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,080
 And the scientists go, "Well, there we go.

110
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,000
 Left-handed people are better at combat.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
 They're at least better at surviving homicides."

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,680
 Now, again, other scientists were like,

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
 "I don't really know about that,

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
 because homicides can be done with guns, or cars, or hot air balloons,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
 or however you want to kill somebody."

116
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,080
 So, there's still more steady that needs to be done.

117
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 But, based on just these raw numbers,

118
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,800
 it does look like left-hand people are at least more violent than right-handed people,

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,320
 if not better fighters.

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,280
 Thank you, new news.

121
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,000
 You always come up with some really bizarre stuff.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,320
 Okay, so now we're sailing.

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,120
 We're leaving Ipoh of Indonesia,

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,600
 which is actually cool, because we're actually quite close.

125
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
 We just got, like, we're run.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
 We just run to the boat, dude.

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
 Just, we're getting on the rabbit rowboat.

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,600
 I know it's small, and there's a lot of us.

129
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,560
 There's a bunch of lefties chasing us through the streets.

130
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
 Just run, run, run.

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,040
 Luckily, they're left-handed,

132
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,880
 so they keep turning left at every block.

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,000
 They keep getting lost.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,560
 However, eventually, they will catch up to us.

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
 Get on the boat, get on the boat.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,120
 Now, this time, I've reconfigured the rabbit rowboat.

137
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,240
 It's the same rowboat, but now it just has a little Jolly Rogers,

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,920
 a little Skull and Crossbones on it.

139
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,240
 Anyways, as we get it all in the boat,

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
 we start rowing away very slowly.

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,600
 The left-handed people do catch up to us,

142
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
 because they can wade in three feet of water.

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,160
 They beat us up, but we still won't be deterred,

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,680
 because we have a mission.

145
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,280
 We have to go find the legendary island of Libertatia,

146
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
 or Libertatia.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
 We'll call it Libertatia.

148
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,920
 So, this was requested by a YouTube user named Weiselhorn.

149
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,320
 Said, "Hey, check out the story of Libertatia."

150
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
 He's like, "I will."

151
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,040
 So, we're going back to the 17th century,

152
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,520
 so we're going to row 88 miles an hour in this rowboat,

153
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,640
 which I'm sure is possible.

154
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,040
 If you can go down a river blindfolded in Bird Box,

155
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,920
 we can row 88 miles an hour in the real world.

156
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,360
 We row, we go through a time portal.

157
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,440
 Back in time.

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,560
 Middle of the ocean.

159
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
 Probably should have planned it better.

160
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,600
 We're out there for maybe about an hour or two.

161
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
 I'm already checking out which one of you

162
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
 has the most muscle tissue on you,

163
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
 because I'm getting a little hungry.

164
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,600
 I'm like, "Hmm, I might eat that person.

165
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,560
 I might eat that person."

166
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,320
 But before I can, a huge pirate ship comes up

167
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,560
 alongside of us, sneaks up on us somehow,

168
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,280
 and they're like, "Oh, Hawaii Métis, what are you doing?"

169
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,040
 And we're all black and blue from our fight in Indonesia.

170
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,560
 And he's like, "Oh, it looks like you guys had a bad tussle

171
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,480
 with some left-handed people."

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
 And I'm like, "Yeah, you don't know the half of it."

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
 And they let us get on board.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,280
 And the captain of the ship is James Mission.

175
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
 We're like, "Hey, James, he's all, "Call me Jimmy."

176
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,960
 And then we meet a priest named Senior Karaseole.

177
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,200
 We're just going to call him the priest from now on, by the way.

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,680
 But anyway, so we asked James, "Hey, what's going on?"

179
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,120
 And he's like, "Well, you know, I'm not going to do that voice all the time."

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,640
 So James explains to us that he used to not be the captain of the ship.

181
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,360
 The ship had a previous captain, and the captain died,

182
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,480
 as will happen on pirate ships in the 17th century.

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,080
 But when he died and the ship was out in the middle of nowhere with no captain,

184
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,960
 the priest that they had picked up along the way,

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,680
 he had a vision of a new world.

186
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,680
 And him and James became close friends when James was just like the first mate

187
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
 or the first matey on the boat.

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
 And the priest was like, "You know what? There's a better way to live.

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,520
 We can live as a commune where everyone has a voice, everyone has a vote,

190
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,200
 everyone does the work that's needed to provide for the community,

191
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,920
 and everyone gets rewarded the same in return."

192
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,560
 James is like, "Oh, it sounds a little socialistic,

193
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
 but you know, maybe we'll give it a try.

194
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,520
 That might actually be a good way to run a pirate ship."

195
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:31,400
 So when the captain died, at this point, James had been told all this stuff by the priest,

196
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,640
 and he was telling the other men on the boat.

197
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,080
 Now, they didn't have a lot of time to vote,

198
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
 sailing in the middle of nowhere.

199
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,320
 They got no captain.

200
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,920
 They need someone to make decisions.

201
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,720
 But I imagine this rousing speech, like, "We are all the same."

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,880
 Remember what the priest just said about all that stuff that I don't want to repeat?

203
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,840
 And they're like, "Yeah."

204
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,440
 And he's like, "Yeah, we should do that.

205
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,920
 We should do that.

206
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,160
 Everyone has a vote, and just we work as a group."

207
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,120
 And they're like, "Yeah."

208
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,360
 So anyways, they're sailing along.

209
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,320
 Now the guys go, "That is a good idea."

210
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,160
 So they vote to make James captain.

211
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,920
 So now you have captain mission, and he is the captain of the ship.

212
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,560
 The boat goes on, and they're thinking, "You know what?

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,360
 And what's interesting about this is that now he's captain,

214
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,280
 he wasn't making unilateral decisions.

215
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,720
 He would come up with a plan and then put it to a vote."

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,880
 And other people could come up with plans as well.

217
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,200
 But there's still a pirate ship out there, of course.

218
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,600
 So they're raiding other ships, blowing people up, still in their booty.

219
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,800
 But then they come to a ship, and they're like, "A jacket!

220
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,000
 Shooting the cannons.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,480
 Muskets.

222
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,760
 Loading it.

223
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,880
 Aiming it.

224
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,000
 Okay, now I gotta load it again.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,440
 Two minutes of this.

226
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,880
 Oh no, I dropped my black powder, gotta pick it up.

227
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,840
 Get a schmitter to the face, or however you pronounce it.

228
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,480
 So anyways, they're doing all this stuff, they raid the ship.

229
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
 It's a slave ship.

230
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
 And they're like, "This is a new order.

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,080
 This is the new age for humanity."

232
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,560
 They tell the slaves, "You're free.

233
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 You can join our ship, and this is the deal.

234
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,400
 One man, one vote, we all work, we all get paid,

235
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
 or we'll drop you off wherever you want to go."

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,840
 So some of the slaves were like, "Yeah, take us to wherever."

237
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,720
 And then the other slaves were like, "Dude, I got nothing going on in that place.

238
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,880
 I will become part of your crew."

239
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,080
 And so that became almost like a side mission for them.

240
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,320
 Their main quest was just to be pirates,

241
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,760
 but then they started attacking slave ships as almost like, again,

242
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,240
 like a side quest, freeing slaves.

243
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,800
 At this point, Captain Mission says, "You know what?

244
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,760
 Put it to a vote.

245
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,840
 What do you guys think about forming a city?"

246
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,880
 And everyone's like, "Yeah!"

247
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 So the boat sails along.

248
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,440
 They get to Madagascar, and they're like, "This is a perfect place.

249
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
 Tropical paradise.

250
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,240
 There's a bunch of penguins here.

251
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,840
 Let's do this."

252
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,920
 So they start to set up this city.

253
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,800
 Now they meet with the local villagers who are already there,

254
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,840
 and because they seem to be so affable, and they're just like,

255
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
 "Hey, we're not like Super barbaric.

256
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,080
 We have like this commune, this new society we're trying to build."

257
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,160
 The villagers took to them very well.

258
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,960
 They start building what's known as Libertatia.

259
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,120
 It is to law enforcement.

260
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
 It is a pirate cove.

261
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,280
 It is a hideout where bandits go.

262
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,040
 But to the pirates of Libertatia, it was true freedom.

263
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,360
 They begin intermarrying with the villagers.

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
 The villagers are like, "Oh, this is totally dope.

265
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,840
 They're giving us gold and stuff like that.

266
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,040
 They're really good neighbors.

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,400
 Sure, I'll let you date my daughter."

268
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,000
 And they start to really intermingle with the communities there.

269
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
 Everything's going perfectly swell.

270
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,560
 But they end up...

271
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,880
 This always is a philosophical question I got thrown here.

272
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,560
 So they end up building a home base, like a really sick pad.

273
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,280
 And then they rebuild their boat.

274
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,120
 Now, this is always that question.

275
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,920
 I don't know what the name of the boat is, but let's call it the Jolly Roger.

276
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,120
 If you had the boat, the Jolly Roger, and rebuilt it,

277
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,520
 so in a year, it wouldn't have one single nail or one single plank of wood

278
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,160
 or a single sail or nothing is the same as when that ship was originally launched.

279
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,440
 Is it still the Jolly Roger?

280
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,800
 I don't know.

281
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,360
 But anyway, so that was an interesting point that was in here.

282
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,960
 So everything's going great.

283
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,200
 They're getting riches.

284
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,880
 But what happened was eventually over the years,

285
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,560
 you are going to have problems not in the internal community,

286
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,920
 but with another tribe.

287
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,440
 Because at the end of the day, everyone has their own boundaries in their territory.

288
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,360
 And your little country may be great,

289
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,440
 but another country may want what you have,

290
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,680
 or it may have a religious difference or whatever.

291
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,160
 But there was a raid from another village onto Libertatia

292
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,960
 and the priest, Captain Mission's best friend,

293
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,720
 and really the spiritual advisor, the person who started this whole thing,

294
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
 was killed.

295
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,560
 And at that point, Captain Mission was just like,

296
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,840
 "We're going to leave."

297
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,160
 Like, it was great while we were here,

298
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,440
 but my heart's just not in it anymore.

299
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,840
 Like, the town is dead.

300
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,760
 So the pirates who wanted to stay behind,

301
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,680
 because they had families there, could stay,

302
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,960
 because again, it was whatever you wanted to do.

303
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,480
 And Captain Mission took his boat, his brand new boat,

304
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,080
 or is it?

305
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,120
 Sailed off with his crew to continue their mission

306
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,920
 of robbing people and freeing slaves.

307
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,400
 And no one ever saw the boat again.

308
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,520
 It was either lost in a storm or sunk.

309
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,120
 But by all accounts, when Captain Mission left Libertatia for the last time,

310
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,920
 he was a shell of a man.

311
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,720
 The death of the priest really, really affected him.

312
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
 The death of the priest and his best friend,

313
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,360
 whose name I can't pronounce, really kind of crushed him.

314
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,560
 And in a way, ended this dream of his for a free world.

315
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,520
 Now, what's interesting is that there's no proof that that story ever existed.

316
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,920
 There are books written about it,

317
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,960
 and there's articles written about it around the time.

318
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,160
 It was a folk legend, and people have actually gone looking for the city of Libertatia.

319
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,000
 They don't know if it is a pirate's folktale.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,920
 They don't know if it's a piece of fiction that someone in England made up.

321
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,480
 They don't know if it's partially true.

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,440
 There's no proof of it at all.

323
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,160
 But what's interesting about it is that they have found remains of pirate bases in Madagascar,

324
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,120
 but they can't say for sure, "Oh no, this is Libertatia."

325
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,520
 So it would make sense because they were pirates.

326
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,360
 It's not like they were keeping, you know,

327
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,080
 it's not like they had go-pros and they were recording everything.

328
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,120
 They weren't writing everything down.

329
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
 They were criminals at the end of the day.

330
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,360
 But it could have been real, and there was just no written documentation of it,

331
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,560
 and just stories were passed.

332
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,520
 As sailors and slaves came and went from Libertatia,

333
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,880
 the story would kind of grow, the myth would grow, and things like that.

334
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,600
 But it really, I think it's an interesting story,

335
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,640
 and it kind of talks about like, it's a Robin Hood story on the high seas.

336
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,760
 He still was a pirate though.

337
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,320
 He still did kill people, but Libertatia, maybe someday they'll find proof of it.

338
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,800
 I don't know.

339
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,040
 But again, 17th century criminal headquarters.

340
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,800
 I don't think it was probably, it was probably up to code.

341
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,560
 I think probably after a couple years,

342
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,120
 everything either washed away or got stolen to build other buildings on the island and so on and so forth.

343
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,880
 But there are people still looking for it,

344
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,960
 so there's enough anecdotal evidence that the story is real.

345
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
 But we may never know.

346
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,800
 I wonder if they ever found Robin Hood's house.

347
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,760
 I've always heard that Robin Hood was kind of real,

348
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,080
 kind of based on a real person, but maybe not.

349
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,160
 But he would have had to live in a house somewhere.

350
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,560
 There's a house, there's drawing of a fox on it.

351
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,440
 Like, Robin Hood would have had to like, chill out somewhere.

352
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,520
 It's funny to think that you could be walking through the woods in England or Sherwood Forest,

353
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,360
 to be specific I guess I should say.

354
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,560
 And you could be walking down the same path that Robin Hood was like,

355
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,720
 brutally murdering people and you would never know it.

356
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 I wonder if, what, his name wasn't actually,

357
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,480
 I wonder if that's where the word "hood" comes from, like a hoodlum.

358
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
 Because you're like, "Robin Hood."

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,080
 Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on to the next story.

360
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,280
 Now the next story was another, another request.

361
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,760
 This was from Matthew, Matthew C.

362
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,320
 He emailed me about this.

363
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,440
 It was funny because we were kind of talking about,

364
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,800
 he was throwing me out the story, and he goes,

365
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,520
 "Oh, I'm sure you've heard a lot about Crater Lake being an organ,

366
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,480
 but again, I don't have a car, so if it's not within walking distance,

367
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
 it might as well be on the moon."

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,600
 Which is a hologram by the way.

369
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,280
 I know that in the Dalles, which is probably about 30 miles away from here,

370
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,080
 it's kind of the home of Bigfoot sightings in Oregon.

371
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,040
 I guess there was a Bigfoot's, I need to go out there and talk to some weirdos.

372
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,760
 Because apparently there was a Bigfoot walking by a mobile home complex in the 1970s.

373
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,280
 Hood River, the only thing I ever came across was once on 4chan.

374
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,480
 One single reference said, "In Hood River, back in the 90s,

375
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,000
 there was a big black dog, a phantom dog stalking the city.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
 Never found any other information on that ever.

377
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,120
 Never found, I was going through like old news articles,

378
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,560
 couldn't find anything on it."

379
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,800
 Unfortunately, 1990s kind of predates the internet,

380
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
 so it can be tough.

381
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,800
 But Big Black Dog and Hood River, I've seen some crazy stuff here,

382
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
 they're all going to that later.

383
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,360
 But to Crater Lakes.

384
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,680
 So we're going back into the future.

385
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,000
 We are in Oregon.

386
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
 Hey, we're at my house.

387
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,280
 We got 2,000 people crowded in my house right now.

388
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,400
 I'm like, "Hey guys, what's up?

389
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,040
 How you doing?

390
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,400
 Don't bump into anything.

391
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
 I'm sorry the place is messy.

392
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,520
 It's normally not like that wink, wink.

393
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,280
 That's always in my lie when people come over.

394
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,240
 I'm like, "Yeah, I was just, I just unpacked.

395
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,480
 That's why this place is like this.

396
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,160
 It's not normally this messy.

397
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
 Fingers crossed me on my back.

398
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,320
 Anyways, we're all going to walk out of my apartment.

399
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,160
 It's going to take a while because there's 2,000 of us.

400
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,240
 That's my listenership right now, if you can believe that.

401
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,800
 It's amazing.

402
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,360
 Thank you guys.

403
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,880
 We walk out of the apartment and we're going to get in the Jason Jalopy.

404
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,520
 It's the only thing.

405
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,640
 It's a land vehicle.

406
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,800
 Carbonar copter still being washed off in the last episode

407
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 till *puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff puff

408
00:18:37,800 --> 00:19:01,800
 so far.

409
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 It's funny because in Native American legends, they're always like, "Oh, that place is cursed."

410
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,040
 Which makes sense because if your ancestors saw a mountain disintegrate,

411
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,840
 you would list that on your 10 places not to go.

412
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,360
 That place is definitely cursed.

413
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,800
 Crater Lake is only filled with snow runoff and rainwater.

414
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 It's some of the cleanest water in the world,

415
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,480
 unless the snow is really dirty, unless like dirty people are rolling around in the snow.

416
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,560
 It's not fed by any sort of streams or underwater wells or anything like that.

417
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,960
 For the longest time, there was the myth, and up until quite recently,

418
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,720
 that Crater Lake was bottomless.

419
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
 They never knew how deep it was.

420
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 It ended up being like 3,000 feet deep.

421
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,760
 It's one of the deepest lakes in the world.

422
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,720
 And I think it's definitely like the deepest lake in North America.

423
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,200
 Now, you don't listen to this show for history lessons.

424
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,320
 Hopefully not.

425
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,280
 So let's get into the creepy stuff.

426
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,720
 Now, when Matthew C sent me the email, he's like, "Yeah, I'm sure you know about all this stuff."

427
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,280
 And I didn't.

428
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,560
 So I had to research all this.

429
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,480
 Some of the stuff that we're going to talk about is just kind of...

430
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 But you're like, "Don't waste my time. Just skip to the good stuff."

431
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,880
 But it sets the mood for how creepy the area is.

432
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,720
 Some of it's just like, "That's probably not true."

433
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,680
 And we end with a truly creepy mystery.

434
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,920
 And again, you're thinking, "Just go to the mystery, Jason.

435
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,760
 Skip all the stuff that you're going as eh."

436
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,720
 This isn't eh.

437
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,520
 This is cool.

438
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,760
 The Native American legend, there's these two giant gods fighting.

439
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,240
 And that's what caused the mountain to blow up.

440
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,840
 And what happened was one of the dudes got his heart ripped out and then chopped into a bunch of

441
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,760
 pieces and throw it into Crater Lake.

442
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,000
 And he's just floating around in there.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,640
 Now, what do you do if your heart's been ripped out and you're a bunch of pieces?

444
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,200
 You turn into a giant crayfish, apparently.

445
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,280
 Because for the longest time, the natives had a legend that the...

446
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,520
 Because it's literally like a crater.

447
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,640
 It's like you can walk along, be walking through the forest, turn,

448
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
 and then there's a steep drop into the lake.

449
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
 And that's how the first white person almost discovered it.

450
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,480
 He was walking, he was looking for some gold, gold, lost gold mine up there,

451
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
 which is another weird story.

452
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,000
 He gets to the crater and he has a horse and the horse stops.

453
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,920
 And he's thinking, "Why is the horse stopping?"

454
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,520
 And he looks down and it's like this huge drop into this crystal blue lake.

455
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,080
 That was the first time a white person ever been recorded seeing it.

456
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,280
 So, quite dangerous.

457
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,080
 There's also beaches if you go the right way.

458
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,920
 But the legend is that late at night, or during the day,

459
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,200
 I probably just met her honestly.

460
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,960
 It's not in my notes that says late at night.

461
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,240
 But if you're wandering there alone, this giant crayfish will reach out of the water

462
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,680
 and grab you, drag you underwater.

463
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,400
 I should say right now, I don't know what crayfish is.

464
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,720
 But anyways, I imagine it has like claws.

465
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,560
 In 2002, which is fairly recent, there was a sighting of a creature in the lake,

466
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,880
 a block long, just under the water, this huge black shape moving under the water.

467
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,080
 Now, when she says a block long, I imagine it's like a giant rectangle,

468
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,840
 but it was actually like some sort of sea monster.

469
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 And she reported it and people are like, "Eh, you know, maybe."

470
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,840
 There are park rangers in the area though, who that's their beat.

471
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,720
 That's where they're always at.

472
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,240
 They're doing their crater lake thing.

473
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,960
 There's an island in the middle of the lake called Wizards Island.

474
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,320
 And there have been reports late at night,

475
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,600
 I know for sure this is late at night, that you would see fires on the island.

476
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,960
 And park rangers would be like, "What? A fire? Like, especially new park rangers."

477
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,120
 They're like, "We better get out there. They hop in the rabbit rowboat."

478
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,440
 They're like, "Why is it so slow?"

479
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,000
 Anyways, so they, why does it still have a pirate flag on it?

480
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
 So they pull up to Wizards Island and there's no fire.

481
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,200
 They'd also hear people like, "Party in deep in the forest on the island.

482
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
 There's no partiers."

483
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,960
 Then they would go back and tell the other park rangers,

484
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,640
 the more veteran, the more seasoned park rangers, and they'd be like,

485
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,280
 "Yeah, it kind of happens all the time. Don't go out there.

486
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,240
 It's kind of spooky."

487
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,480
 Like, you'll see it and you just kind of ignore it.

488
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,880
 So even to this day, there's stories of like curses and things like that in this area.

489
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,040
 Now, there is a huge...

490
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,480
 I was reading the article and it said,

491
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,280
 "There's an old man who floats in the lake."

492
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,080
 And I was like, "What? There's an old man just floating in there?"

493
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,800
 No, it was a bit misleading.

494
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,440
 There is a tree called the old man.

495
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
 It's just like a tree that broke off,

496
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,240
 or like, from erosion, the entire tree fell into the lake.

497
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,160
 And most of it's underwater, but they're like,

498
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,520
 top is sticking out, a big chunk of it's sticking out.

499
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
 It's been floating in...

500
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,760
 The tree has been floating in Crater Lake for about a hundred years.

501
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,840
 It just floats from one end to the other, kind of bobs around, moves around.

502
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,280
 Now, I guess I should have said earlier,

503
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,400
 this is a really big lake as well. It's super big.

504
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,080
 So it's not just like a tiny little lake,

505
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,000
 which would be technically a puddle, but so this thing floats around.

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,840
 And then I was like, "Okay, there's a tree that floats around.

507
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,040
 That'd be kind of cool to see and maybe to like go out to and stand on."

508
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,320
 And it's like, "Woo!"

509
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
 But there was a story I read.

510
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,520
 This is where I was like, "Eh, the scientists wanted to launch a submarine,

511
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,320
 a little submarine into Crater Lake to see how deep it was,

512
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,760
 to do some scientific experiments."

513
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,160
 And they go, "Well, you know, we don't want the old man to hit our sub.

514
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,720
 So let's lash it down, bring it to shore, and then we'll let the sub in.

515
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,800
 And then we'll unlash it when we're done."

516
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,400
 And when they lashed the old man and they brought it to shore, a massive...

517
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,680
 There's not gunshots, that's lightning.

518
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,120
 [Sounds of lightning]

519
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,520
 A rain...

520
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,680
 Coming down.

521
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,320
 So anyways, they're like, "Oh my god, we must have angered somebody because this..."

522
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,040
 Now, again, this story involves scientists.

523
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,920
 The scientists go, "Oh no, because we lashed this tree down.

524
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,040
 This storm has come.

525
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,400
 Let's unlash the tree."

526
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,440
 And they cut the rope and the tree floated back on the storm and did.

527
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,640
 That story is, I can guarantee you, is 100% made up.

528
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,000
 If it's not made up, they brought a tree to the shore, a storm happened to develop,

529
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,680
 which if they were checking the weather, you know, they would have known it was coming.

530
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,840
 That obviously didn't happen because if at any point scientists were like,

531
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,680
 "Hey, let's just remove this one object from this observational area."

532
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,560
 And something drastic happened and then they cut it and it ended,

533
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,440
 they're immediately gonna say, "Let's do it again."

534
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,800
 They're not gonna be like, "It must be magic.

535
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
 They're scientists."

536
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,640
 And I know they might be mad that their lab coats got really wet,

537
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,720
 but still, you would say, "Let's do it.

538
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,520
 Let's just do it again.

539
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,360
 If that, let's just see."

540
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,720
 The scientists would be like, "Okay."

541
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,960
 So that story, I was like, "That's pretty ridiculous,

542
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,560
 but I'll take the giant crayfish.

543
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,240
 I'll take the wizard island with the spooky lights on it."

544
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000
 Maybe even the sea monster, because why not?

545
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,080
 It would be kind of hard for a sea monster to get in there,

546
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,920
 because again, all the water is from snow runoff and rain.

547
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,960
 It's not being fed by any canals, at least that we know of.

548
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,560
 But here's an interesting story.

549
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,920
 1975, everyone's kung fu fighting.

550
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,960
 Disco is king.

551
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,440
 There's this photographer who's like, "You know what?

552
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,680
 What I want to do, mom and dad."

553
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,440
 And they're like, "Take photos."

554
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,920
 And he's like, "Yes, good guess."

555
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,480
 So I'm going to hop in my Volkswagen bug,

556
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,280
 and take my camera, and I'm gonna go take these photos.

557
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,320
 And they're like, "Okay, that's what we expect you to do.

558
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
 You're a grown adult.

559
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,320
 You're a photographer.

560
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,040
 Why are you telling us?

561
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,080
 Just leave. Just go."

562
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,200
 He's like, "Okay."

563
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,080
 He drives away.

564
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,960
 Totally disappears.

565
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
 Totally vanishes.

566
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
 And of course, so they start looking for him.

567
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,160
 He said he was going to be in the Crater Lake area.

568
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,240
 They start doing searches for him.

569
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,040
 Can't find him.

570
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,000
 Now, anytime there's wilderness, it's really easy to die.

571
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,680
 It's really easy to get lost.

572
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,120
 If both of those happen, it's very easy for your body to never be found.

573
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,000
 But a while later, these dudes are walking by.

574
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,640
 These dudes are hiking, and they see a box canyon,

575
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,040
 which apparently is a canyon that's a rectangle.

576
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,440
 I don't know.

577
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,520
 I imagine it's like a tiny little canyon.

578
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,200
 It's not like a grand canyon.

579
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,280
 There's only two types of canyons, grand canyons, and box canyons.

580
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,240
 Anyways, they find this body laying there in a box canyon.

581
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,760
 And so they go get the rangers.

582
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,800
 They're like, "Oh."

583
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,720
 And they go and they get the rangers.

584
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,280
 And the rangers are like, "Sure. We'll be there right away."

585
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,080
 First, we got to lash down this tree for the tenth time

586
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,600
 and see if a storm develops.

587
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,240
 They're like, "Quit messing with the tree.

588
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,840
 Go pick up this body."

589
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 The rangers get out there, and they find an incredibly bizarre scene.

590
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,760
 They find a body, kind of.

591
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,280
 So imagine a person, a dead person, laying down on the ground,

592
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,920
 and their back is kind of propped up against a log.

593
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
 So the legs are stretched out right in front of them.

594
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,160
 Their back is arched up, you know, like back set up against a fallen log,

595
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,680
 and they're just kind of slumped over dead.

596
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,880
 But erase everything above the ankle bone.

597
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,720
 It's just completely gone.

598
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,920
 And you go, "Well, yeah, if a body dies,

599
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,400
 there's a chance that he's just going to get scavenged

600
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,240
 by all the crazy little animals."

601
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,040
 But here's the thing.

602
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,320
 They're...

603
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,360
 Let's go from the top down.

604
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
 Obviously, there's no torso.

605
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,160
 We already said that person was gone.

606
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,280
 No t-shirt, nothing.

607
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,760
 Now, it's common when people are stuck in really cold environments.

608
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,200
 There's this weird thing where they actually start to feel too hot.

609
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,160
 Their body overreacts.

610
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
 They start taking clothes off.

611
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,000
 And it was snowing when he went missing.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,560
 Actually, 102 inches of snow in that area when he went missing.

613
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,800
 So he was in an area he wasn't prepared for.

614
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,280
 But they find this guy, or like I said, what's left.

615
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,120
 So they don't find a shirt.

616
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,280
 They just find a pair of jeans and a pair of socks.

617
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
 And the feet bones are in the socks.

618
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,440
 So like the ankle bone and all the little broken pieces of the little toe bones,

619
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,160
 because they just fall off, are all in the socks.

620
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,680
 But the pants are still slaying there perfectly fine.

621
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,040
 So like I said, if someone was leaning against a fallen log,

622
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,840
 and then everything above the ankles just disintegrated and the pants just fell empty.

623
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,920
 Oh, and a piece of a skull was found farther away.

624
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,480
 Just a piece.

625
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,320
 Piece of a skull was found farther away.

626
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,440
 No other bones, no other flesh, no other blood, nothing.

627
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,120
 All they found was a pair of jeans,

628
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,160
 pair of socks still in the jeans,

629
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,440
 and feet bones in the socks.

630
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,600
 Like he had almost melted away.

631
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,840
 You're thinking scavengers, Jason Scavengers.

632
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,920
 The police had a couple weird questions about this.

633
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,520
 One, where were the shoes?

634
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,000
 Scavengers don't eat shoes, but again they go,

635
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,480
 well he could have taken them off because he was suffering from this

636
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,760
 delusion, hypothermic delusion, where he thinks he's really hot.

637
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,600
 So he could have taken the shoes off.

638
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,440
 Same thing could have happened with the shirt.

639
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,000
 The thing is, is that he was 12 miles from the trail in 102 inches of snow.

640
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,640
 So they're thinking, how would he have,

641
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,120
 he didn't have the equipment to be in the snow.

642
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,560
 He went up there, it got super snowy, he disappeared.

643
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,200
 They ended up finding his car, but they didn't find his money with him.

644
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,600
 He didn't find, never found his wallet in his pants,

645
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,560
 and they never found his camera.

646
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,720
 So the police are kind of baffled.

647
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,560
 To this day they don't know if he was murdered and he was robbed,

648
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,200
 and then dumped somewhere remote,

649
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,360
 and someone took the rest of his body as a trophy.

650
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,120
 He has the trophy thing wrong.

651
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
 He's like a really like feet,

652
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,400
 and I'm a serial killer and I gotta keep a trophy

653
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,160
 and then he gets home and he's like, "DOOH!"

654
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,240
 He took home everything but the feet.

655
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,320
 He's like, "Ahh, I can't go back and get it."

656
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,160
 Left it in that box canyon.

657
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,920
 They don't know if it was death by misadventure,

658
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,040
 or they don't know if he was murdered and butchered somehow.

659
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,000
 But if you think, oh maybe he just ran a foul of a serial killer,

660
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,840
 let me tell you about one more inhabitant of Crater Lake.

661
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,720
 Bigfoot!

662
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,320
 Bigfoot's been seen there.

663
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,480
 He's actually a total dick,

664
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,280
 because this Bigfoot, the Bigfoot in Crater Lake,

665
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,000
 is known for picking up pine cones and throwing them at you.

666
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,960
 So, maybe he's just trying to play baseball?

667
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,200
 Maybe these are special interdimensional pine cones

668
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,080
 that make you melt everything but your ankle bones?

669
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,760
 But quite aggressive Bigfoot sightings in that area.

670
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,840
 So who knows?

671
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,680
 From a crayfish, to a sea monster, to Bigfoot,

672
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,880
 to a log that can cause storms.

673
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,280
 The area could be full of supernatural events.

674
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,200
 It could be a perfect place for a serial killer to dump a body.

675
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,520
 But whatever the reason, I don't think I'm ever going to Crater Lake.

676
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,320
 It just sounds super spooky, plus I'm not a big fan of lakes.

677
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,680
 Who wants to be above something you can't see under?

678
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,760
 I guess that's called floors actually.

679
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,840
