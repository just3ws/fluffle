1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Missing Persons Week continues with a terrifying incident that happened this month.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,720
 And then we try to outrun a carnivorous cloud that strips the meat from bones.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,080
 Doesn't matter if you're alive or dead, it will eat you if it exists.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,640
 And then pick a number between 1 and 8 because we're going to the Gladiator arenas today

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,000
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,360
 Missing Persons Week continues and I'm actually pulling an audible because I actually found

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,320
 out a terrifying story that just happened.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
 Absolutely chilly.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,600
 This has been pretty big news but they just solved the crime.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,320
 Over the past couple days I've seen all over the news there's this young attractive woman

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
 named Samantha Josephson from Columbia, South Carolina.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,200
 She was popping up in the headlines for a while, gone completely insane.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,160
 And this all happened within probably about like two or three days.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
 But it was new.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,240
 I was seeing her face pop up.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,200
 But it was just confirmed what happened.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
 So let me take you back here to the beginning.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,760
 The year is 2019, the month, late March, early April.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,160
 This happened super recently.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,000
 Samantha is out with her friends partying in club.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 College student.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,840
 She's getting ready to take her finals or do whatever you do in college around this time.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,200
 But she's also having fun with her friends and at some point in the night she's separated

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,560
 from her friends like "Now I'm going to go home."

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,800
 It's 2am and she decides to call an Uber.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,040
 I've used Uber before and it's really dicey.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
 I've used Uber when I was in Sacramento for my brother's wedding and I was like "I don't

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,600
 know these dudes man.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,760
 I don't like getting in other people's cars."

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,440
 I'm always cautious about getting in cars with strangers.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,640
 I'm actually kind of cautious in getting in cars with people I know too.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 But she calls for an Uber.

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,320
 By 1.30pm the next day she's reported missing.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,360
 And a couple hours after that her body is found in the woods by some hunters.

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
 So very very quick wrap up to this.

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
 The first article was she's missing.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,480
 Second article, the second day I think they were still talking about she was missing and

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
 then later that day they mentioned that she had passed away because they were waiting to

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
 notify the family.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,360
 But here's what happened.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,680
 This is what they, because they've arrested the guy who was responsible for it.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
 The way they found him was this.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
 She called for an Uber and the Uber, it will tell you the description of the car that's

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,000
 going to pick you up.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,280
 Generally the license plate is well I believe.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
 But it's late at night you may not necessarily be thinking.

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,320
 That if you ordered a car and it was going to be a black Chevy Impala pulling up to

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,160
 your block.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,920
 And you happen to see a black Chevy Impala on that block.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,520
 She just got in it.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,360
 Car drove away.

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,000
 The Uber driver comes up a little bit later, waits there, no one gets in the car.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,800
 Puts it in saying hey someone called me but no one ever came and picked it up.

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,560
 So when the girl goes missing the cops then begin searching for black Chevy Impalas and

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,480
 they find one, they pull him over, rest the guy.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,400
 He had in the car, he actually had a passenger in the car at that time but she's been totally

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
 cooperative with the police.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
 She wasn't there that night.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,600
 But he had like bleach and a little bit of blood and some germicidal wipes and all that

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 stuff.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,960
 She died because she got in the wrong car.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,480
 That is absolutely bizarre.

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,080
 I can imagine her walking up to a car and being like oh hey, she gets in and the guy's

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 like whoa, what are you doing?

69
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,920
 And she'd be like oh I'm sorry, I thought this was my Uber.

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,800
 No, no, no, I was just parked here.

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 I live here.

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
 Oh, oh sorry, sorry.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,920
 That would happen 99% of the time.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,560
 Maybe 0.5% of the time she'd walk up to the car and it would be someone in there doing

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
 something nefarious and being like yo bitch, what are you doing?

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
 Get out of my car.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,760
 Oh, I'm so sorry man.

78
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Dude.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,920
 She gets out, she finds her Uber.

80
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,080
 In an infinitesimal amount of the time she would get into a car that happened to have

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,640
 a murderer in it.

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,080
 Bad luck.

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,920
 And you could say well she should have done this, she should have checked the app.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,520
 Who would have thought that if you happen to get in a car on accident that looks like

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,320
 a car, I don't blame on her at all.

86
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,400
 I think it would be very easy late at night to see a similar car and at least walk up to

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 it.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,520
 It would be a drug deal going on and then you get shot.

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
 That's something different.

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
 You walk in and you see a criminal activity, they chase you down.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,040
 She got in the car and he just murdered her.

92
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,200
 What are the chances of that really?

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,720
 For her, unfortunately it was 100%.

94
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,840
 I'll be shocked, shocked if this is the only person he's ever murdered.

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 Shocked.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,320
 Because if I was driving down the road and a super hot woman got in the back of my car,

97
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,400
 the first thing that pops in my head isn't going to be oh I'm going to murder her.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
 She's in my car.

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,880
 I mean might as well, right?

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,600
 He had to have done this before.

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
 Had to have done this before.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,480
 Crazy, spooky.

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,920
 I read that and I was like that's chilling.

104
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,160
 That is an accident and you get murdered.

105
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
 Sometimes people have accidents, they fall off of bridges, they get hit by trains, paint

106
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,960
 bucket comes, hits them on the head because they're trying to accidentally break into

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
 this kid's house.

108
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,120
 All sorts of stuff.

109
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,760
 But to accidentally actually get murdered by a murderer, that honestly might be the

110
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
 first.

111
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,320
 People walk into scenes where there's drug deals and get shot, that's pretty accidental

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
 too.

113
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,440
 But I can't think of another time where a person just happened to get in a vehicle and

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,480
 drive away on accident with a murder.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,320
 Actually I guess that's pretty much every hitchhiker story but you know what I mean,

116
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,800
 it's still really, really weird.

117
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,200
 Just trying to get home from a party.

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 Weird man.

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,400
 Okay but let's go ahead and move on to something a little lighthearted.

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 Oh wait, no.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
 This isn't lighthearted.

122
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,000
 Actually it might be lighthearted because it might be a, it kind of looks like cotton

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 candy.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 So we are going to Sunny Sunny Florida.

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,480
 Wasn't we here recently?

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,000
 Oh we went here for that dude who got murdered and then yeah, that was a couple episodes

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,600
 ago, a guy got murdered by his buddy and now retroactive spoiler alert.

128
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,760
 But now we're going back to Florida.

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,840
 We are going to go hunting ourselves, not hunting literally ourselves, which actually

130
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,880
 be the most dangerous game, but we're going to go hunting as well along the Tomaca River,

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,600
 which is west of Dayton.

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,520
 We go, we're in Florida, we're in the Tomaca River.

133
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,000
 We're walking by it with our rifles.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,200
 Walking through the woods.

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,080
 Dogs all hehehehehe.

136
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
 We go, we get the ducks that we just killed and then we notice something.

137
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,840
 It's early in the morning, it's a little cold outside.

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,120
 We're standing there in our full hunting gear and we start to see a pink mist kind of roll

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,400
 through the forest.

140
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,240
 Looks almost like a cotton candy color.

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,160
 Looks pleasing to the eye, but we start to notice that the forest around us is getting

142
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,520
 very very quiet, like all the animals are leaving.

143
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,440
 We kind of start to back up from this cloud.

144
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,280
 It's rolling about from the ground to your waist coming towards us.

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,560
 You see a little bunny rabbit with the little broken paw.

146
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,280
 It can't run away like the other ones.

147
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,720
 It's like meh meh meh meh meh.

148
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,920
 I don't know what sounds rabbits make.

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,600
 I am one, so that's kind of weird, but anyways, and we see the cloud roll over and we hear

150
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,360
 a "Ugh!"

151
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,400
 And before the mist completely covers the rabbit, we begin to see its flesh dissolve.

152
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
 So we book it.

153
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,520
 We run all the way back to the carbonar copter, jump inside, take off.

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,200
 Dude, you left the dog, not my fault.

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,920
 I would've rescued him, you left him.

156
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
 Hopefully, he'll make it.

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,520
 But we can't land now, the mist is everywhere.

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,600
 So what is this mist?

159
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,600
 It's known locally as the Carnivorous Pink Cloud or the Cannibal Cloud.

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,960
 It was sighted as far back as 1605 when Spanish to Explorish ran the area.

161
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,160
 But most of the sightings, the recent sightings, have been between 1955 and 1966.

162
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,120
 Some people have said it's possible that it's some sort of just mist that is colored by

163
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,920
 the morning sun and has no carnivorous properties at all.

164
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,800
 Some people say that it's nothing supernatural, but it's pollution that's rolling in and

165
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
 rolls in every once in a while and it does burn your skin if not eat it off.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,240
 And the reason why these legends have popped up is two things.

167
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,040
 One, people will find bones in the forest, sometimes human bones, and there have been

168
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,400
 reports of multiple people missing in this forest.

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,800
 The third explanation is not chemical or that it's just regular mist that's beautiful.

170
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,240
 Apparently in that area there was natives, they weren't Native Americans, they were

171
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
 just natives in the area.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,880
 There was a golden cup and they had access to basically a sacred fountain.

173
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
 But they weren't supposed to use either of them.

174
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,800
 If you use the golden cup to just like drink spring water out of, that was bad.

175
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,920
 And if you drink out of the sacred pool of water, that was bad.

176
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,720
 There was a guy named Chief Tomkey who did both.

177
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,800
 He grabbed the golden cup, stuck it in the water and drank it.

178
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,480
 And the other tribes declared war against his tribe.

179
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
 There was massive battle in the area.

180
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
 And his entire tribe was slaughtered.

181
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
 Chief Tomkey was the only man left.

182
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,800
 He had this magical healing liquid in him.

183
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 At that point though, a beautiful young maiden from one of the rival tribes named Olita shot

184
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,000
 him with an arrow, killed him, and then she ran to get the cup for herself almost like

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,200
 Gollum for the ring and then another tribe member killed her to keep her from getting

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
 the power as well.

187
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
 So some believe that this rolling mist is Chief Tomkey.

188
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,120
 I think it's even possible that the healing powers from the cup and the water made it

189
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,400
 so Chief Tomkey isn't dead, but he still needs to feed.

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,640
 He turns into this pink mist and he still, his spirit is still almost trapped in a hell

191
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,080
 where he's not alive, he's not dead, he's immortal.

192
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,200
 Now he's just this cloud that creeps through the forest of Florida, eating everything in

193
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
 its path.

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,560
 Now everything I just told you is an urban legend.

195
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,600
 None of it is verifiable at all.

196
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,440
 It's a really, really interesting story, but there's absolutely no proof behind it whatsoever.

197
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,200
 And I know you're thinking, "Jason, great, you just told me this cool story and now you

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,040
 - but you know, like you gotta be realistic about this stuff."

199
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,480
 They say that there's several missing people.

200
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
 I've read quite a few articles on this.

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,680
 They talk about missing people in the area due to the fog, but there's no names.

202
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
 There's no dates.

203
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,120
 There's nothing I can verify where they say, "This person went missing on April 12th,"

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,240
 or even, "This person went missing in, you know, 1957."

205
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
 There's nothing I can verify.

206
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,800
 So it's just reports of missing people in the area.

207
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 Reports of bones being found in the woods is suspicious of their human bones.

208
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,760
 However, bones are a pretty natural phenomenon, i.e., you rot.

209
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,120
 You die, your body rots.

210
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,880
 If there were Native American battlegrounds here, there would definitely be bones or fragments

211
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,440
 of bones in the dirt and things like that.

212
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,760
 Multiple people quoted the same thing about the first sighting was in 1605.

213
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,000
 There's none of them attribute that fact to any other sight.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,520
 They're basically all referencing each other.

215
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,360
 And then most of the accounts come from people who live in the area saying, "When I grew

216
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,320
 up, I heard about the carnivorous cloud.

217
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,800
 I heard about somebody."

218
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,000
 You know, so very urban legend.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,680
 So I don't think it's true at all.

220
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,200
 The actual theory that the mist itself is part of the healing properties of the cup,

221
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
 I made that part up.

222
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,840
 I made that part up because here's my thing.

223
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
 Let's assume it's true for a second.

224
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
 And I didn't make that part up to trick you.

225
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,240
 I was just trying to weave it all in.

226
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
 So here's my thing.

227
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
 When I read it, I said, "Whoa, this is really interesting."

228
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,240
 And every article I read repeated almost verbatim the same claim.

229
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,280
 So I go, "Okay, there's really nothing behind this."

230
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,800
 I was really looking for a name of a person who went missing.

231
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,680
 All we have is the first sighting, an 11-year time period, and then stories that people

232
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,360
 were told when they were kids.

233
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,240
 But then I put back on my imagination cap.

234
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,560
 I go, "It would be interesting if you had the power of immortality."

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,460
 Okay, so in the animatrix, and I've talked about this before, in the movie The Second

236
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,080
 Renaissance, there's this thing where when the humans built the robots to begin with,

237
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,120
 they made them look like humans, which would make sense because you'd want them to be able

238
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
 to move about in human spaces.

239
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,680
 But once the AI, once the matrix basically was starting to be constructed and the AI

240
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,680
 completely separated itself from humanity, it realized that human forms were actually

241
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,120
 not the most efficient.

242
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,440
 The insect form was.

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,160
 So that's why all the robots you see in the matrix are like those squid things.

244
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,600
 And it's really great because in that movie, you see the first great battle between man

245
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,760
 and machine and its men versus humanoid machines and the men win.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,040
 But then the AI creates these insectoid machines that are far more efficient than the human

247
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,800
 body with multiple limbs and different backup systems and stuff.

248
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,320
 So if the head gets blown off, it has all these other redundant systems, and they just

249
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,440
 swash on humanity.

250
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,760
 If you had the power to be immortal, if you drank something mystical that made you immortal,

251
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,480
 I don't think, again, we're in a speculative place here, but...

252
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,080
 A human form isn't the best form to be immortal in.

253
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,320
 It really isn't.

254
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,880
 Like as much as I love being a human, if you were immortal, you'd be much better off being

255
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,760
 something else.

256
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,160
 Because unless you were unbreakable, like swords would break off you and stuff like that, this

257
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,040
 guy obviously got, again, assuming this is real, got an arrow in his chest, the human

258
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
 form is inefficient.

259
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:22,880
 But mist or rain or water or smoke or anything like that, anything that has a physical body

260
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,600
 is still limited to the physical realm.

261
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,680
 If you became immortal, it would make sense if you had a choice, I guess, but it would

262
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,200
 make sense for you to be cursed or gifted with a non-caporial form or incorporeal form.

263
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,240
 So I like, I think my theory, because I think the whole thing is made up anyways, my theory

264
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,960
 is that yes, he did drink from the cup, he did drink from the sacred water, he was killed,

265
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,280
 but because he couldn't be killed only his physical body was destroyed, he did become

266
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,680
 this carnivorous mist that floats through the forest and continues to devour.

267
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,400
 Now, of course, the question of that is why was it only really seen between 1955 and 1966?

268
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,040
 Well, I have two answers for that.

269
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,400
 One, it may have moved on from that area, the pink mist now may be in other areas, other

270
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 states where people don't know to run from it, taking down hikers and campers and little

271
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,440
 animals running through the woods.

272
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,680
 Or going with my theory as well, it simply evolved to a less obvious form.

273
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,160
 It still feeds, it's still lust for blood, now you just can't see it coming.

274
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,920
 Right now though, we are going to talk about Gladiator Theater.

275
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,160
 So not just sword and sandals, not just buff dudes with swords chopping each other up, crowd

276
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,040
 going crazy, Gladiator Theater, which is different.

277
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,540
 It was where they would basically put on productions in the arena.

278
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,720
 You think, oh that's awesome, Romeo and Juliet?

279
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,680
 Well kind of, except they both die horrible deaths, like they did in the original play.

280
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,600
 But this one is more like live action saw movies.

281
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,540
 So go ahead and pick a number between 1 and 8.

282
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,840
 So it is a hot summer day in Rome.

283
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,880
 The sun's beating down on you, you're dripping sweat, your pecs are just like, you got full

284
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,040
 abs.

285
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,600
 If you're a chick, pecs, you still got pecs, you're just boobs now, and then you got full

286
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,680
 abs, you're just super fit.

287
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,440
 But the sweating though isn't from the heat, it's because you're about to be led into the

288
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,320
 Gladiator Arena.

289
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,960
 All of these deaths were basically set up to be like plays.

290
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,160
 Back in about 30 BC, a man is being led into the Gladiator Arena, and in the arena he sees

291
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,960
 a giant wooden structure in the shape of Mount Etna.

292
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:59,160
 Now if you don't know, Mount Etna is a volcano, and he's led up to the top of the wooden structure,

293
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,560
 the crowd's going wild.

294
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,200
 So you're kinda eager, you're like, yeah dude this is kinda cool.

295
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,040
 This is the most famous I've ever been.

296
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,200
 You get led up to the top of Mount Etna.

297
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,280
 And at that point, the Emperor of Rome goes, if you picked number 4, this is you.

298
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,880
 You're like, okay great, there's no volcano around here, obviously Hot Lava's not gonna

299
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,040
 shoot out of this mountain.

300
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,160
 The mountain basically does erupt, it just breaks apart.

301
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,760
 But instead of Hot Lava shooting out, these are all real by the way.

302
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,520
 You, if you pick number 4, you fall into the volcano, but instead of Hot Lava, it's just

303
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
 a bunch of lions.

304
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,480
 And they just rip you to pieces.

305
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,240
 Just eat your legs off, totally chew you up.

306
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,360
 So not only do you have a pretty bad bruise from falling about 20-30 feet, you fall on

307
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,280
 hungry animals.

308
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,320
 Which would be the worst combination.

309
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,000
 Now there is Hot Lava, it's all your blood pouring out of the mountain.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
 First century AD.

311
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,760
 You guys remember Hercules?

312
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,240
 Hercules was a pretty cool guy.

313
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,760
 He did all those things.

314
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,440
 He was like fighting hydras and like diverting water and all that stuff.

315
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,840
 And you notice as you're being led into the arena, you are dressed like Hercules.

316
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
 And you're like, oh great, what are they gonna do?

317
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,640
 Have me do a bunch of weightlifting?

318
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,960
 Did they actually find like seven snakes in time together and I'm gonna chop their heads

319
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
 off?

320
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
 What's going on?

321
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,320
 So you get led into the arena and it seems pretty normal, but there you see some wood

322
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,200
 in the middle of it and you're like, oh that's kind of weird, what am I gonna do?

323
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
 Like bench press this wood?

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,680
 I can do that.

325
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,080
 And then as you're getting closer to the wood, you remember a little story about Hercules.

326
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,200
 Hercules was a demigod.

327
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,920
 He was half man half god.

328
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,480
 But when he ascended to godhood, they had to do something to him to make him fully a

329
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
 god.

330
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,880
 And that's when you see the emperor come out and go, if you picked number two, this is

331
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,400
 your fate.

332
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
 You walk out.

333
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,680
 Well actually at this point you're getting dragged out because you start to see the guys

334
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,280
 getting the tar ready and they're lighting it on fire and they basically just throw you

335
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,680
 on the wood and set you on fire.

336
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
 You burn alive.

337
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,960
 And before you go, ah yeah, that's okay.

338
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
 Burning alive is actually one of the worst ways you can go.

339
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,760
 I actually heard this story once and I mean, I heard this story, it was on Mysterious Universe

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 actually.

341
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
 This psychic was talking about reincarnation and she was saying that, I don't remember

342
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,280
 all the details, but I remember the visual, that she was a witch you had burned during

343
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
 the witch trials.

344
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,800
 Mysterious Universe is a great show by the way, but.

345
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,760
 And she said when she was set on fire, the first, again this is a past life regression

346
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,240
 hypnotist so take it or leave it, but she said when she was set on fire, the stakes she

347
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,600
 goes, the first thing she realized was how wet she was, not sexually.

348
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,560
 But because, and I don't know how scientifically true this is, I don't want to really like

349
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,080
 look up photos of it, but when you're set on fire as your skin melts away, you're still

350
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,920
 alive, your veins open up and you're covered in your own blood and it's almost like your

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,760
 blood is trying to put out the fire itself, so you actually feel super like wet and slick

352
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,280
 as you're burning alive.

353
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,800
 I don't know, I do know though that burning alive is one of the worst ways you can go,

354
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,760
 so maybe you do get a little bit of comfort as your blood's trying to cool you down, I

355
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,360
 don't know, it's gruesome either way, but that was you if you picked number two.

356
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,900
 Now we're moving on to another first century disaster.

357
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,240
 This one you notice you're dressed up like a guy named Mucus Scaevolia, now I'm sure

358
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,280
 it's maybe it's Mucus Scaevolia or maybe it's nothing like I'm even pronouncing it,

359
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,120
 everyone in the arena is scratching their head, they're like who's that, who's that guy?

360
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,920
 This one if you pick this number, I think you're getting off pretty good.

361
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,480
 In the arena you just see a little like pulpit thing, like a little, I have, what's wrong

362
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,760
 with me, a little pillar on the top is a bowl, bowl's on fire.

363
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,780
 Mucus Scaevolia was a dude who basically tried to kill an old Roman emperor way back

364
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,620
 in the day and they caught him and this was kind of badass, he basically said, oh you

365
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,620
 can catch me, but there's a bunch of other Greeks out there that are going to murder

366
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,220
 you and let me show you, and he goes let me show you this, he sticks his hand in the fire

367
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,100
 and just held it there for a while and he goes, like that's my dedication to killing

368
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,980
 you, I can go through this pain, I'm going to use this hand to kill you someday or some

369
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,340
 other Greek is going to.

370
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,040
 So anyways, in this one all the dude had to do was go out and stick his hand in a fire

371
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,920
 and if he could do that he was set free.

372
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 Or they killed him, we don't know about the historical evidence for that, but the emperor

373
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,480
 is kind of like, oh it's kind of boring, but he does say if you picked number eight, you

374
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,240
 just burned your hand, that's it and you're allowed to go, we'll allow you to leave.

375
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,120
 So that's not too bad, I could put my hand, if my choice was burn my hand or get set on

376
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,060
 fire or chop myself off, they may have made him put his hand in there for quite a long

377
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,140
 time, I don't think they just let him like put it in, they might have held it in, but

378
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,580
 even then dude, I would take the hand burning, so if you picked number eight, I think that's

379
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,780
 probably the best one, you guys are all shutting off the podcast now, all the people here are

380
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
 number eight are like I'm done.

381
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,580
 The next one though we start to get a little ridiculous again, it's 80 AD and you notice

382
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,300
 you are dressed up as Orpheus, the god or goddess, one of the two, I think it was a god, it doesn't

383
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:20,040
 matter, you're dressed up as Orpheus and you're given a lyre, a little like harp thingy.

384
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,040
 Now Orpheus's power was that he or she could play the lyre, they could play the lyre or

385
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,480
 leer, what a man this is totally going off the rails, but anyways they could play this

386
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,440
 instrument and they could soothe everything, they could soothe humans, make them just humans

387
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,500
 just go oh you're totally awesome, they could even soothe rocks, rocks would be like rock

388
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,780
 on and more importantly, music can soothe the savage beast, so you're let out into this

389
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,800
 arena, you're surrounded by wild animals and you are told by the emperor, number seven,

390
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,540
 if you play them a song and they don't eat you, you are free to go.

391
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,080
 And before the emperor even gets done saying that, Achita rips your generals off.

392
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,760
 This guy had no chance at all, no chance at all, these animals are constantly bred for

393
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,960
 combat in the gladiator arena and you send them out there with a musical instrument to

394
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,800
 sit down in front of them, he is beset by these creatures right off the bat, anyways

395
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,160
 gets torn to pieces by these things, crowd goes wild and these guys are generally either

396
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,220
 criminals or Christians, so you have a pretty good chance of whether or not you're just

397
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,980
 a dude who was praying to the wrong god or you murdered somebody.

398
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,660
 So ADAD, this one's pretty awesome, this one took some work, someone was really inventive

399
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,140
 with this one, you are Deidolius, De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De-

400
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,460
 Icarus' father, it's the dude who told his son, hey I'll make you these wings and you

401
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,780
 can fly up to the sun, or no he didn't ask him to fly up to the sun, he made him the

402
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,040
 wings and the dudes flew too high, the wings melted, it's weird how much like those sayings

403
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,480
 come from old stuff, but he flew too high, his wings melted, he crashed the earth, so

404
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 this one you're dressed up as De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De-

405
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:30,960
 this one you're dressed up as De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De- De-

406
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,920
 And the emperor goes, if you chose number 3, this is your fate, or maybe not, maybe you'll

407
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:46,000
 make it, and basically you were instructed to fly from one, they were really inventive,

408
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
 you were instructed to fly from one end of the arena to the other, so you basically had

409
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 this harness and a rope and it was basically like a zipline.

410
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:24,480
 So you're like, dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

411
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,640
 And you're like, I wonder what that for, are they going to start juggling while I'm flying

412
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 over them?

413
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 No.

414
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,680
 The wings are pre-programmed to break right over the bears, you fall in horribly mauled

415
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,400
 and eaten by hungry hungry bears.

416
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,840
 I think if I had to choose between being eaten by a lion would be worse than being eaten

417
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,120
 by a bear, because I imagine lions are any sort of wild cat, does that, playing with their

418
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,800
 food type of nonsense?

419
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,400
 Also don't they, no that's dogs that like grab food and shake it around until the next

420
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
 snaps.

421
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,240
 I wonder how, I think bears would probably just like step on you and then just eat you,

422
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,880
 or eat you and step on you, I don't think it would be as bad, I think it would be much

423
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 quicker.

424
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,320
 But anyways, this guy is falling in slow motion towards four hungry bears, and that's you,

425
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,080
 if you picked number 3.

426
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,480
 Next one, ADAD, still man they had a banner year this year, ADAD.

427
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,080
 In this scenario you're actually a woman, because again these are all true events.

428
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,800
 This woman, she notices that she is dressed up as Pasi-Fei.

429
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 Pasi-Fei.

430
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,400
 Now Pasi-Fei is known for two things.

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,960
 One, she placed a curse on a dude so every time he ejaculated snake scorpions and centipedes

432
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
 would come out.

433
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,760
 Which now no matter what that guy did, that is 100% an overreaction.

434
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,400
 There is nothing you can do, nothing you can do that would deserve every time you ejaculate

435
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,880
 a scorpion, a snake, or a centipede would come out.

436
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 Nothing.

437
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,560
 But she's known for that, but more famously she's known for being the mother of the Minotaur.

438
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,520
 So and then she is let out and there is a basically a cow costume out there for her

439
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,600
 and now you're like oh I was hoping for the centipedes, this doesn't look good.

440
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,720
 There's a cow costume and it's not like a onesie from Party City like fluffy cow costume,

441
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,800
 it's basically a cow she has to climb into.

442
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,280
 And as you hear a bull being released from the doors, the big gates behind you, you hear

443
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:34,320
 the emperor say if you pick number six, I hope you have a high tolerance to pain.

444
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,280
 And at that point the bull came out and had its way with the bull costume, unfortunately

445
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,720
 you're in it and you die because that's what's going to happen.

446
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,400
 There's no way out of that situation.

447
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,840
 Second century, now we're a little bit more progressive, we've moved on from that horrible

448
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,400
 thing, it's second century.

449
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:02,640
 You're dressed up as Attis and you're like god damn it, why can't I have been Hercules,

450
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,280
 why didn't I pick number two?

451
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,880
 Why didn't I pick number two?

452
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,760
 But you're Attis, also known as the castrated god.

453
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,240
 So that one you were simply just let out into the arena and they cut your balls off in front

454
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 of everybody.

455
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,280
 And, but this one you actually have company because they did this for a bunch of dudes

456
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,560
 came out of the arena all at the same time and they got their balls chopped off one by

457
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
 one.

458
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,600
 So, just to make things fair, the emperor says if you chose number five, you're Attis

459
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,760
 and you're at the end of the line so you gotta watch everyone else suffer.

460
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
 That's you if you pick number five.

461
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,920
 So finally though we have number one and now number one is an interesting story because

462
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,960
 we actually have a journal of this person before they entered the arena.

463
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,400
 There was a woman named Perpetua, she was caught for being a Christian and she was a

464
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,400
 diehard literally eventually but she was ready to die for her religion and when they said

465
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,680
 hey we want you to dress up as this mythological figure, it'll be awesome.

466
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
 The crowd loves it.

467
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,240
 She's like no, I'm Christian, I'm not gonna dress up like that.

468
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,800
 And they go okay we'll just throw you out there nude and she's like okay fine, I mean

469
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,720
 you're gonna throw me out there anyways but she is panicking about this whole thing.

470
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,200
 And she's keeping a journal and the night before she's set to go in the arena she has

471
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,480
 a dream where she comes out into the arena and there's an Egyptian warrior in front of

472
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
 her.

473
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,640
 Now she was told she was going to fight beasts in real life but when she enters the arena

474
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,160
 she's relieved to see another person there because she can fight another person and she

475
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,360
 sees them as an Egyptian which in so and it's interesting because in Christian culture

476
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,560
 back then Egypt represented like darkness and satanic forces and stuff like that.

477
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,840
 So she comes out in the arena, she sees this Egyptian gladiator come towards her.

478
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,120
 In the dream then she becomes a man, it's kind of weird, and then she's surrounded by

479
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,840
 young hot dudes who are all on her side.

480
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,240
 A giant Jesus shows up in the dream dressed as a gladiator trainer and so Jesus shows

481
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,680
 up and goes, giant Jesus shows up and goes okay this is how it's gonna go.

482
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,160
 If the Egyptian wins he's gonna chop you up with his sword but perpetual if you win

483
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,120
 I'm gonna give you this staff and how all these golden apples on it and he goes and

484
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,720
 it was basically the staff of eternal life.

485
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,600
 Super weird dream and I guess probably before you're about to die you probably do have some

486
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,800
 vivid dreams just chock full of symbolism and she does dude she straight up matrixes

487
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,880
 the Egyptian dude like she jumps on top of them starts beating them up throws them in

488
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,120
 the ground beats them up some more and she wins and she wakes up and she goes I know

489
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,560
 she's basically writing a journal is like I know I'm not going to die tomorrow I know

490
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:46,240
 Jesus is with me I know that no matter what happens I will come out triumphant.

491
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,760
 However, if you did pick number one you get gored to death by cows so she did die and

492
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,000
 unfortunately she had to face the beasts so if you pick number one you do get gored to

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,400
 death by cows but you have a kickast dream before that chock full of symbolism you had

494
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,000
 a little bit of hope before going in there you didn't get castrated so that was good

495
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,520
 so yes another interactive adventure I really like doing these but it's kind of hard to

496
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,160
 find stories where multiple people die in different ways I mean we can only hope that

497
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,680
 more this is tragic obviously this is absolutely tragic but you ever show often I'll come across

498
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,680
 the store and I was like oh dude this is totally gonna be a choose your own adventure ones

499
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,560
 that would actually be cool to do a full choose your own adventure podcast but there we go

500
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,320
 one through eight which one did you pick which fate sealed you in but that's it for another

501
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,200
 episode of Dead Rabbitio you know I know I normally in the or have been in these shows

502
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,800
 with kind of like a nice ending like a good twist ending but this episode probably had

503
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,760
 the most deaths possible on a show we've done I think more people have died named people

504
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,760
 not like episodes that involve war but we've had just horrible horrible people die so let's

505
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:10,160
 end on a happy note I can't think of anything dead rabbitio gmail.com is going to be your email
