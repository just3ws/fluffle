1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Did a battle of the wits between two giants reshape the landscape of Ireland and Scotland?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that the Black Plague wasn't a natural disease spread by fleas or rats.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It was actually a biological attack from aliens today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I don't wanna sleep down, actually I'm a walkthrough down.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I am your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We've got a lot of interesting stuff to cover. Do I have any notes?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm trying to think. If I have anything I need to talk about.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 No, I think we're good.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 So let's go ahead and get started with the first story here now.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 So the first story we're gonna talk about, we're going back to the land of fables.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now this is an interesting one. We covered Taley Poe and we covered Humpty Dumpty.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 This one is a little more...it's kinda weird because it's...

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Okay, so let's just go ahead and jump into it.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So in Ireland they had a character, a guy named Finn Mackool.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Finn Mackool. Now he was basically their version of Thor, their version of King Arthur.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 He was this mythical hunter, warrior, leader type guy who was...

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 He was taken fairly seriously in their literature, in their myths.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And at some point someone thought, "Hmm, let's retcon this guy."

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Like they took this dude, imagine if they took Thor throughout Norse mythology

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 and not only turned him into a comic book character, but turned him into a fat slob and a coward.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I don't know who came up with this version of the Finn Mackool story,

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 but I had never heard of the guy until I read this and then I thought that this was it.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Looked into it and he's like a national hero.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 He is their icon in Ireland, or at least he used to be.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So someone really didn't like Finn when they came up with this story.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 So in this version of the story, Finn Mackool is not a great warrior, or a great leader,

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 or a mythical hunter or anything like that.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 He's a giant, so he has that going for him. He's much bigger, he's huge in this story.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So Finn Mackool one day is kind of messing around at this place called the Giants' Causeway.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So around Scotland and Ireland there's these hexagonal giant poles.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And it's because of Magama bubbling up. It looks really weird.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It looks man-made and it's one of the reasons why people think that trees don't exist,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 because they don't look... they're hexagons.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Like people go, "How can you see hexagons in nature?" You know, honeycombs.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 You do see them, but Scotland and Ireland both have these hexagons.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And so the story was there used to be a bridge leading from Ireland to Scotland.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It was called the Giants' Causeway. The Giants themselves

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 placed these stones so they can get back and forth.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Well anyways, so Finn Mackool's messing around and he decides to challenge a giant in Scotland.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The giant in Scotland, his name is Benadonnor, also known as the Red Man.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now he may be a mythical hero to the Scottish people as well, but I didn't look into that.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So he's sitting there, this great hero of Ireland is a giant in this version,

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and he starts yelling across the sea, "Hey Benadonnor! Benadonnor! Let's fight!

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I'm tired of all this fight stuff that we've been arguing about that Jason didn't research.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Come and get me!"

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So Benadonnor, he's just hanging out in Scotland, drinking a couple pints.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's a giant, so he'd be drinking a couple gallons.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He's like, "Oh man, okay, let's rumble. Let's do this."

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Finn Mackool is standing on the Irish side of the bridge, and he starts seeing Benadonnor walk towards him.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And first off, just how it normally is, he's so tiny in the distance that Finn Mackool's like,

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 "Oh, I can break this dude."

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But as Benadonnor gets closer and closer and closer, he realizes that he picked a fight with the wrong giant.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 I don't know if they've never met before, but he should have figured just the word giant in his name.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 He's equal size, but this guy was a giant among giants.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So Finn Mackool gets super scared and runs home.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Again, national hero reduced to a loonatoon character in this legend.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He ran all the way back home, and his wife is there.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 His wife's name is Unog.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And he's like, "Unog, Unog, this dude's coming. He's totally gonna stop me.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I picked a fight with the wrong guy. You have to help me."

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And she's like, "Yes, dear. I will help you.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Um, go hide in the baby's room.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Uh, dress put on this baby uniform. Baby uniform. I just happened to have sitting around."

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 He should be creeped out. We should be creeped out that she has baby clothes that fit her husband.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But if you want to know if your marriage is in trouble, ask your wife to disguise you as a baby from a guy who's going to beat you up.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 If she doesn't leave you on the spot, she's a keeper.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So anyways, Finn Mackool dresses up like a baby.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 This mythical lawyer, great hero, dresses up as a baby in heights.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Benidonor does come into the house, and Unog realizes, "Mmm, he's all giant.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Maybe he could satisfy my, my wanting needs."

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But she puts that aside because she has a duty to her husband.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 She invites him in, and she goes, "Oh, yes. Okay, I'm just doing the voice, 'cause that's gonna get old."

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 She goes, "Yes." I'll do a little bit later. She goes, "Yes."

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 She goes, "My husband's gone, but may I show you around our humble abode, our giant house?"

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Giant Benidonor's like, "Yeah, sure. I'm gonna have to duck to get in all these doors, 'cause I'm so much bigger."

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 "Hehehe, I bet you are!"

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So she starts to play a battle of the wits with this dude.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 She goes, "Hey, look. This is my husband's. I don't think they've met before, 'cause otherwise, both of them are total idiots."

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But she goes, "Look, it's my husband's spear."

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And she points to a massive redwood sitting in the corner of the house, and he's like, "Mmm, if he's throwing that around, he must be really, really strong."

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And here is his shield, and it's just like, takes up half the house.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Again, why does she happen to have this stuff sitting around?

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But anyways, the story, I guess I'm pointing out logic in the wrong parts. There's giants existing in this world.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 He's like, "Hmm, I couldn't lift that shield."

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And then she goes, "Hey, are you hungry? You look like a big strapping man. You look like you could hold a giant woman down and please her."

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 He's like, "What?" And she's like, "Nothing, nothing."

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "Are you hungry?" He's like, "Yeah, I am a little hungry."

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 She goes, "Let me get you what Finn McCool normally eats."

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Now, this is where it becomes, basically, Tom and Jerry.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 She gets two slices of bread and puts a hot iron riddle in between the slices of bread and goes, "This is what my husband normally eats. He eats this all the time."

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And when Benidotter bites into it, all his teeth fall out.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He's like, "Ah, only a true warrior could eat it."

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I mean, come on, dude. At that point, if you ever bit into something and your teeth fell out, you're going to check it and be like, "Hey, why'd you put metal in this sandwich?"

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Like, I mean, you can call their bluff, dude. You don't have to then go on with the rest of her trials.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But he does. Because then she goes, "Oh, that sandwich, that's probably not gonna fill you up. Let's give you this piece of steak."

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And it was really a slice of steak with a board of wood with nail sticking out of it, nail to the bottom of the steak.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Really, Benidotter, you're gonna eat that. You can obviously see that there's wood attached to it, but he does, 'cause he's an idiot.

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Breaks out the rest of any teeth he had remaining are broken out. Plus, now he's like, bleeding from the mouth.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 He's still walking around the house, though. Then she goes, "I have to go feed the baby. You want to come see the baby?"

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, now this is the ultimate bluff, because the baby is her husband."

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And I'm assuming when she's gonna feed him, let's make it, you know, I'm gonna breastfeed him.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Okay, that might be a little gross, but anyways, they both go into the baby's room and there is Finn McCool, dressed up as a baby,

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 and Benidotter's like, "Oh, if the baby's this big, then Finn McCool must be a giant."

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And no point does he realize that baby is too big to come out of that woman. Absolutely not. There is no way that is possible for a giant woman to give birth to a baby bigger than herself.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Never even considers the fact. However, he is in intense pain from having his teeth knocked out.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So, she then has one final test for him. She goes, "Want to play catch?" And after everything that's happened, he goes, "Yeah, yeah, let's go on and play catch."

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Also, do you have any Vicodin? Because I'm in extreme pain right now. No, no, I don't have that. Let's go play catch.

110
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And she goes out there and there are these massive boulders in their backyard and she goes, "That's what Finn plays catch with. Go ahead and pick one up and throw it to me. I'll catch it."

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Benidotter's like, "Okay." He looked a little heavy. Are you sure you can catch it? She's like, "Oh, yeah, I play catch all the time."

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 He then picks the boulder up, holds it above his head to throw it and drops it on his skull and fractures his neck.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So, at this point, he's like, "There is no way I'm fighting a guy that's this big." And he starts to go back to Scotland.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Now, Finn McCool being the great hero that he is, as he sees Benidotter walk away, he lets him get a couple miles away and then he jumps out of the baby's crib and starts like trash talking him,

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 eventually pulling up pieces of the earth and throwing it at him. One of the big chunks he pulled out made a locknig,

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 which I actually think might be Loch Ness, but I'm not entirely for sure on that. And that piece of earth missed Benidotter, landed in the ocean, became the Isle of Man.

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And then once Benidotter got across the giant causeway, Finn goes, "You know what? I'm never going to make that mistake again." He destroyed the rest of the bridge.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 So that's the legend. I think it's interesting because, one, it would be the equivalent, I think the best equivalent is,

119
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 if you had the, we have the story of George Washington, who is a real person, but fairly mythical at this point.

120
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He's a real person, but he's such a national hero, he's such a symbol. If someone wrote a story where he pretended to be a baby to hide from the King of England,

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 it's just such an emasculating legend. It's such a bizarre story to tell.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And in the end, the dude's a total punk because not only does he wait till the guy leaves to then challenge him to a fight again and start throwing stuff at him,

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 he then destroys the ability for that guy to ever come back. I think something else happened in this story. I think that as he was in the baby's crib,

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Oonga, he heard from the other room, Oonga's like, "Ooh, my husband can always satisfy me. Here, let me spread my legs."

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And then she really tricked him into wearing a blindfold and he's just humping a hallway and he's like, "You can't feel anything.

126
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 There's nothing here." And she's like, "Oh, are you in yet?" And he's like, "Uh, yeah, yeah, don't say that. That's very insulting."

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I think that happened as well. I think, technically, Finn McCool got cucked by his own house.

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You got a stranger over there, being in your house, thinking it's your wife, that has to gotta mess you up a little bit.

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And then he's like, "I'm gonna destroy a bridge if that sequence of events happened to me as well."

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now, our next story was actually a request. It was a requested story.

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It's On the Conspiracy Iceberg. It's always the best of both worlds when those two things line up.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 This is from Sage Says on YouTube. Sage says, "Requested this story."

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So, on the Conspiracy Iceberg, the phrase is, "Aliens cause the black plague."

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It's an interesting idea, and there's some interesting backing to it. But before we get into that, let's set the stage.

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's the mid-1300s. People are just milling about in Europe, doing villager stuff.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Walking around, cutting wheat, making bread, eating bread, sleeping. The normal life cycle of a peasant.

137
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 But the black plague didn't just affect peasants. It affected whole population centers. But you had these people going about their normal, dark ages day.

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And they look up. Like they always do. They're bored. There's no television, so if you want to see something, you just look up.

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Go, "Hey, birds." I wonder if that bird, Ross, is gonna get together with that bird, Rachel.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I don't know. I guess I'll have to tune in next week to find out.

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But this day they look up. There is a long, cigar-shaped object in the sky.

142
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 What? What is that? Hey, peasant guy with a peasant name. Look.

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 What? Hey, run and tell the town crier! I can already see it. Oh my god, everyone's coming out of their houses and they're watching this object float in the sky.

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 What?

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 [SPLAT]

146
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 A white cloud begins to emit from the back of this cigar-shaped vehicle.

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 When no one starts coughing, it's not this immediate like, "Bleugh, bleugh, bleugh, oh look at my body, I have black plague!"

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's just a mist. Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

149
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 That's just a mist. Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 The plague came from Asia to Europe. People didn't have any real immunity to it. It came over either with rats or new evidence is saying it came over with fleas and lice.

151
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But it decimated, more than decimated, the European population.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Generally, it's accepted that 30 to 60% of Europeans' population was killed off at this time, and it wasn't one particular thing.

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And that's why some people lean towards the UFO thing. It wasn't like you had the plague and then it was over with.

154
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 You know, Ebola will pop up, it seems like, every year, but the plague would kill a bunch of people and then lay dormant for 5 to 10 years.

155
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 They'd have no problem with it and then it would pop up again and wipe out another 100, 200,000 people.

156
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 This went on for about 400 years. It was quite the sight to bleed, get it?

157
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So, the point is, is that this wasn't like, it was a virus that would come and go.

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 What's interesting, some of the things they can't really figure out about the bubonic plague, so you have the bubonic plague, which is generally caused by the fleas and the lice and the rats.

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 You get that and you get the bulbous, you get the big black bumps on your body, and it's super painful, and it has a pretty high kill rate.

160
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 But it's not super transmissible between humans. You have to get bit by something and then something else bites you.

161
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Pneumonic plague, which also was around the same time, was different. That would cause you to throw up blood and you could give it to other people.

162
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And they say most people who died during that time period, technically, the black plague is a catch-all term.

163
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 The bubonic plague was one part, a different disease, but if you had the pneumatic plague, not pneumatic like pistons, but you know what I mean?

164
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Like, pneumonia version of the plague. You were dead and everyone around you was dead as well.

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 This plague is still around, this version of the plague, the breathable one, but it tends to strike in cold weather

166
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 when people are trapped in houses together, or you know, small contained areas, and they're breathing it in.

167
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 What was weird about what was going on in the Middle Ages was that the pneumatic plague, I'm just going to use a catch-all term plague,

168
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 because I'm pretty sure I'm not pronouncing that word right, but the plague, instead of being passed around in cold weather in contained conditions,

169
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 the plagues were striking during warm periods, spring and summer, and you would have areas that were completely isolated,

170
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 for the most part, from other city centers, and they were getting it.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So you'd have places where they weren't interacting with nearby villages, and they were just getting wiped out during the summer.

172
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And so scientists even now, they're like, "We don't know what the mechanism was for everything that was going on."

173
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 A lot of it was shoddy record keeping. The people keeping records were dying.

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Plus, you know, they weren't writing anything down. Everything was wood carving.

175
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You know how long it takes to carve wood as you're throwing up blood?

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It didn't act like a normal disease.

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And that's where the conspiracy theory started that aliens caused the black plague.

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 The scenario that I gave you with the cigar-shaped UFOs, that was put forth by an author named John Franco,

179
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 or Juan Franco--no, it's John. I don't know. It's spelled with a G.

180
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So, John Franco, degli esposti.

181
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Sorry, sorry, sir. I know that's--I didn't even come close, but--

182
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 He's a UFOologist and author. He's written several books about UFOs.

183
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Now, that was his--he said that in--between 1347 and 1350, these cigar-shaped crafts were spotted over the skies in Europe,

184
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 and released a mist onto these people.

185
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I haven't been able to find any verification of that outside of his work,

186
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 and that is a second-hand quote because someone else was quoting him.

187
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But here's the thing. You can find stuff about aliens caused the black plague in Italian.

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I couldn't find--I mean, I'm sure if I kept looking I could probably find English versions of this stuff.

189
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 But the top search results are going to be in Italian.

190
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Very, very, very well documented, I guess, sourced materials, but it's all in Italian.

191
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So, I was running through a translator, so there's a little bit of translation issue.

192
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But I don't know if this is just an Italian conspiracy theory, if it hasn't really caught on in America.

193
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 But, John Franco--whatever he pronounced his name--he's written tons of books about this.

194
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 They're all in Italian, and I found multiple websites that are in Italian

195
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 focusing specifically on aliens in the black plague and aliens in the Middle Ages.

196
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So, it was weird not to find that stuff in English, really,

197
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 but I guess it is a more obscure conspiracy theory.

198
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That's why it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

199
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So, these are the reasons why it may make sense.

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The plague would pop up in areas that it shouldn't have, in times that it shouldn't have,

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 and it ended up abruptly.

202
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So, you'd have a bunch of people get it and start dying, and then it would stop.

203
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And then it would be another five, ten years, and then it would happen again.

204
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Obviously, the big question is what would be the purpose of aliens doing this?

205
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 They had the ability to drop plagues on us from their ships.

206
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Why would they just do it for, you know, a couple years, kill--oh, shit, it was 400 years,

207
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 and they did kill off, like, kill off, like, 40 million people.

208
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But I mean, like, why wasn't it constant? Why was it just focused in Europe?

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Why weren't they doing it worldwide if they were trying to do some sort of depopulation thing?

210
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 That would be the question. It could be a test.

211
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 It could be an accident where the ships don't mean to be leaking this exhaust, this chemical.

212
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But those are questions that I think we can't answer right now.

213
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Why? Why would they be doing it?

214
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Let's assume for a second that they did do it.

215
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And what's interesting is, again, going back to these Italian sources,

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 there are tons of sightings, recorded sightings of UFO objects in earlier, like, 600 AD forward.

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And of course you go, "Well, Jason, yeah, there's that book in the Bible that talks about Ezekiel."

218
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I'm talking about, like, UFO sightings that resulted in people getting just mashed.

219
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 'Cause, yeah, everyone can look up and see a UFO.

220
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That's kind of lost its luster.

221
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Let's look at the stories where it had pretty grim consequences for the people involved.

222
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And again, this was, I was translating this from Italian, so I don't have some of the information got lost,

223
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and that's my excuse. I did try verifying some of this even more.

224
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 In 1548, in a place called Thuringia, there was a globe of flame that appeared in the sky.

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So you're thinking, "Oh, maybe it's a comet."

226
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 A lot of this stuff you'd think was like, comets or asteroids and stuff like that, or meteorites,

227
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 but the people in this area called Thuringia, a globe of flame goes, "Pfft!"

228
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Meteorite, right? Just entering the orbit, blows up.

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Coagulated blood shoots everywhere.

230
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 They said if they were covered in red goo that resembled coagulated blood,

231
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 which reminds, which makes me think of the Kentucky Meat Storm story.

232
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Like, is it something coming from, is it some sort of event?

233
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Either it is a natural event like a meteorite spraying blood everywhere, or it's a UFO type of thing.

234
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And it's so funny because where I got that from, the article said,

235
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 "A globe of flame seemed to explode on Thuringia in 1548, dropping a substance similar to coagulated blood in the most total dismay of the people."

236
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Well, no, duh, no one's gonna want to be like, "Oh, you know what I really need today? I need to be covered in blood."

237
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 "Pfft! Thank you!" Like, of course they're dismayed, their clothes are ruined, and they only had one set of clothes, they're peasants.

238
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So, we have the coagulated blood falling on everybody.

239
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Here's another event, and this was 8th Century Europe.

240
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 They couldn't get a specific place for this incident off of this website, but...

241
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 So, this story is 8th Century Europe, this next one we're gonna cover, and it's...

242
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I couldn't get more specific than that, I think a lot of it was translation errors, but 8th Century...

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And my incompetence, but 8th Century Europe.

244
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 People started reporting these creatures that control the skies in their ships.

245
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 They called them the "Silphie", and they saw them everywhere, so much that they gave them a name.

246
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Like, it wasn't just like, "What's that?" They're like, "Oh, no, no, that's the Silphie, they're here every week, they're usually coming to town to buy milk."

247
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But no, they would see these vehicles fly overhead.

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Let me read you this quote.
