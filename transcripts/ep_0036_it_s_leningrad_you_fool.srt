1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Can you make a house out of toothpaste?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,240
 And this one isn't funny.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,920
 When ghost hunts become deadly today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,800
 Hey everyone, thanks for coming back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
 I probably shouldn't reverse the order of those two stories that I introduced because one,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
 I can't really say it with a straight face and in the other,

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
 a young man unfortunately lost his life.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,080
 It's actually pretty recent too.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,400
 We'll be getting that into a moment, but I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hope you're enjoying this massive heat wave we're having.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,560
 You'll hear the occasional car drive by for two reasons.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,040
 One, I'm recording during the day, which I normally don't do,

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,040
 and my window's open because if I had my windows shut, I would become a steam tam in here.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,160
 All my fans are off, so at least I'm able to eliminate that noise.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
 But I gotta have a window open.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,200
 We'll try to silence out the cars as much as possible,

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,560
 but we'll go ahead and I think we're gonna go ahead and just get started.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,520
 It's so hot.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
 So we're gonna go ahead and just jump right into it and see where this little,

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
 because this mystery is a little winding.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,440
 It takes you in some weird places.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,880
 Now, before I get started, of course, there's always before I get started,

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,800
 I need to reach out to you guys to see if I'm the only person who does this.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,360
 I realized that there's something that I call shower protocol,

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,520
 right?

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
 And I just realized this the other day.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,160
 I take a shower in the exact same order every single time.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,440
 I just realized this.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,840
 Turn the shower on, obviously.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
 And the first thing I always do is wash my left arm.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
 Then I wash my genitals.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
 Why are they called genitals?

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
 Because everyone only has one.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
 Is it just my genital?

37
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
 Because it's just one of them, right?

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
 But anyways, so I wash down there,

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,400
 and then, man, those cars are gonna drive me crazy.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
 Okay, I'm gonna go shut the window.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
 Okay, so in the 30 seconds it took for me to walk to the windows,

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,400
 shut them, and walk back,

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,800
 I've already lost 15 pounds in water weight.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,520
 I'll probably go on some sort of sweat lodge vision quest

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
 while I'm recording this episode.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
 But shower protocol, so I'll wash my left arm first,

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
 then I wash my genitals,

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
 then I wash my right arm,

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,120
 and then I drop the soap for whatever reason.

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
 I always lose the soap at this point in my shower.

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,240
 And I get it, and then I watch my torso,

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,640
 then I wash my legs that people do either/or.

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
 I never wash my back either.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,520
 I've never like soaked up my back,

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
 I just figured the water takes care of that.

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 And I realize that I do it the same way

57
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
 every single time I take a shower.

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
 I'm wondering if that is a Jason thing,

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,960
 or if other people like,

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,560
 subconsciously, they always wash themselves

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
 in the exact same order.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
 Maybe it is just a Jason thing.

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,440
 Maybe that's the order of things.

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
 Oh, and I wash my butt.

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
 I left that out.

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
 When I say I don't wash my back,

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,800
 I do wash my butt.

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
 That actually comes after my right arm.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
 And then I wash my butt.

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
 Then I wash my torso,

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
 which I guess I should probably change that order up.

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
 But I figure soap, soap.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
 So all the bad stuff kind of gets washed off the soap.

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
 That's how it works.

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
 So yeah, I might want to try to change that order,

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
 but is that just the Jason thing?

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
 I wonder if other people have a particular way

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
 they wash themselves.

79
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,080
 And it's never been a conscious decision,

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
 but I'm wondering if I'm basically washing the parts of my body

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,880
 in order of importance.

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
 So get back to me.

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,800
 Let me know how you showered, people.

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,920
 I want to know what you're like,

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,240
 naked and wet in the shower.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,320
 Hit me up at DeadRabbitRadiogmail.com.

87
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,000
 Let's go ahead and jump into the story though.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
 Just wanted to share that with you

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,240
 and get some feedback on that.

90
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,400
 Colgate Fortes is one of the conspiracy theories

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
 that pops up on our always discussed

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
 conspiracy theory iceberg list.

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
 Colgate Fortes.

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,440
 And actually, that's how I found out

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,000
 about our last story, Ranny Cott Fort.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
 On the last episode, I was looking for Colgate Fortes,

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
 and then I was trying to figure out

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
 if that was a code for something.

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
 And so I started looking up Charcoal Fortes.

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,600
 It took me to Ranny Cott Fort.

101
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,680
 But anyways, Colgate Fortes,

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,200
 the little bit of information I found

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,320
 was maybe one or two sentences on a website saying

104
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,800
 that Colgate Fortes was something

105
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
 that ex-Russian military officers did.

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
 They took a bunch of Colgate out to Siberia,

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,640
 and they made houses out of it.

108
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,400
 So, of course, a normal person would go,

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,840
 "No, that's ridiculous."

110
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,000
 But me, I began googling,

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
 "What is the freezing point of Colgate?"

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
 "Can you freeze toothpaste?"

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
 "How long does toothpaste stay frozen?"

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,640
 I think I actually tried looking for stuff like,

115
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,400
 "Can you build a structure out of toothpaste?"

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,040
 Now, here's the thing.

117
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
 Siberia is blisteringly cold.

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
 I wrote a book about the Siege of Stlynengrad.

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
 I think it was just called Stlynengrad.

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,600
 It was an amazing book.

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
 So, the story was about a symphony about Stlynengrad

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,960
 and the orchestra in the city

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,800
 under siege by the Nazis

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
 trying to get people together to perform that symphony

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
 as like a propaganda tool.

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
 It was a great book.

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
 It's all non-fiction.

128
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's all 100% true.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 There's a bunch of cannibalism in it.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,920
 People, women are like giving birth to babies

131
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,960
 and then eating them.

132
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
 There's roving gangs of cannibals

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
 having shootouts with the police.

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,040
 They had to form an anti-cannibalism brigade.

135
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
 It was such a huge problem.

136
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
 Towards the end, the symphony that's

137
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
 "Leningrad" started off with,

138
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
 maybe had like 17 people left

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
 because they'd all gotten blown up.

140
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
 The constant shelling of the area.

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,600
 It's great.

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,320
 It's a great read.

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 Very, very tragic yet uplifting story.

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
 One of the interesting things though was that

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
 the Nazis, they weren't prepared for the winter.

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,040
 They came in their light clothes,

147
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
 a lot of paratroopers and stuff like that.

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
 And one of the problems is,

149
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,920
 is it got so cold that you just had to poop your pants.

150
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,720
 You go, "What does it have to do with being cold?"

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,680
 And here's why.

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
 In the book it says,

153
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,080
 "If you pulled your pants down to poop,

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
 if you pulled your pants down to poop,

155
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
 your butthole would instantly freak shut

156
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,040
 and you would die

157
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,560
 because you could never go poop again.

158
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,920
 You could never get warm enough

159
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,520
 to get your butthole loose enough to poop."

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,040
 So you just had to poop in your pants.

161
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,280
 That's miserable.

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
 Like yeah, being in war is pretty bad,

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
 but being like,

164
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
 "Oh man, I hope it all gets shot

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
 and I get home to my girlfriend Isabella

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
 and we're gonna have a bunch of babies."

167
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
 And then your butthole frees his shut

168
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,760
 and then you spend the next three or four days

169
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
 trying to figure out how to warm yourself up

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
 and then you just die

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
 because your intestines explode.

172
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,480
 I guess at a certain point you'd stop eating

173
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
 because you wouldn't want to poop anymore.

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
 But I think at that point you're kind of SOL.

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,920
 Anyways, so I knew that the area that rushes like super,

176
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,760
 it's cold enough to freeze your butthole.

177
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,920
 I figured maybe you could spray

178
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
 and build a structure out of toothpaste.

179
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,920
 It could Siberia is even colder, right?

180
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,800
 Because it's Siberia.

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,360
 So I looked all over for,

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
 "Can you build a house out of Colgate?"

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,080
 And the way that toothpaste is made,

184
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 it really doesn't freeze that level.

185
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
 The water in it would freeze.

186
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,840
 And as the more I researched it,

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,960
 the more I started thinking about

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
 how much toothpaste did these guys have?

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,880
 I mean, you would have to have a ton of toothpaste.

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
 Like you have your satchel

191
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
 of your normal survival supplies.

192
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 And then you would need basically a house,

193
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,560
 enough toothpaste to build a house,

194
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
 or even a hut or an igloo.

195
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
 And then once I realized that,

196
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
 I go, "Why don't they just build igloos?"

197
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,560
 So I think Colgate 4, it's as far as this has been going,

198
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,840
 is busted.

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
 And then you're going, "Jax, why are you wasting our time

200
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,600
 talking about something that is so foolish?"

201
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
 And even when you're researching it,

202
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,080
 you realize it was ridiculous.

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,720
 Well, this is why.

204
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
 This is the interesting part.

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
 The second question I was researching,

206
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,640
 when I was looking at the Colgate 4,

207
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,760
 it was, "Why would Russian military go to Siberia

208
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
 to build these Colgate 4?"

209
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
 So they're doing some sort of testing or something.

210
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,640
 What happened is during the Russian Revolution,

211
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,320
 Russia had a ton of gold, literal tons and tons of gold.

212
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,200
 And the anti-Bolsheviks were like,

213
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
 "There's no way we're letting the Communists

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
 get ahold of all this gold."

215
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,760
 So a bunch of ex-military officers did run away to Siberia,

216
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 like came from the original Colgate story.

217
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,200
 But they didn't take Colgate with them.

218
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,360
 They took the wealth of an entire nation to Siberia.

219
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
 That happened back in 1918.

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
 They've never been able to find it.

221
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
 They looked all over for it.

222
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,800
 There's always these rumors and cryptographers were looking,

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,080
 because they had a coded sheet of coordinates.

224
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
 But no one could find it.

225
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
 People, it was basically the Russian equivalent

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 of the Lost Detriments' Mind or the City of Gold.

227
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,720
 This had become a legend.

228
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,680
 What happened to this gold?

229
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
 Would anyone ever find it?

230
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,760
 Last year, they found it.

231
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,080
 So fellow Dead Rabbit radio listeners,

232
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
 if you were in Russia and you wanted to hide something

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
 where you hoped no one would ever, ever find it,

234
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,120
 out of the entire continent of Eurasia,

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
 you have everything from Moscow.

236
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
 Well, you don't want it in Moscow,

237
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
 because the Commies are there,

238
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
 but you go all the way, all the way east,

239
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
 deep, deep into Siberia.

240
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
 Where would you put something

241
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,960
 if you wanted to make sure that no one would find it

242
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,080
 and it would be protected?

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,600
 Would you put it somewhere, say, where aliens lived underwater?

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
 Yep.

245
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
 Out of the entire continent of Eurasia,

246
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
 the gold was found at Lake Baikal.

247
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,600
 Lake Baikal, you may recall,

248
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
 was actually the lake that we talked about earlier

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
 in the series, where they had the giant alien creature

250
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,160
 swimming underwater apparently,

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
 and they were able to throw frogmen,

252
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
 not literal frogmen, but Russian frogmen up into the air,

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
 and there were supposed to be UFOs down there.

254
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
 Of all the places they could have hid the gold,

255
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
 they hid it there.

256
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,760
 More specifically, they hid it in a railway tunnel.

257
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,360
 And after a hundred years of mystery

258
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,800
 of trying to find this gold,

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
 which may have been dropped there

260
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
 to be protected by monsters or aliens.

261
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,080
 So, you know, maybe like they figured,

262
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,480
 "Oh, you know, we've heard legends of monsters out here,"

263
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
 or they knew there were monsters out there

264
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,880
 to dump the gold, or it's also possible

265
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,640
 that people who did dump the gold there

266
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,520
 began those legends to scare people off from that area.

267
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
 But anyways, after a hundred years

268
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,480
 of trying to figure out this location of this gold,

269
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,960
 it was a mathematics genius

270
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,760
 who found a Russian mathematics genius

271
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
 who the media is not releasing his name

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
 because he's wanted by the FBI

273
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,880
 for the hacking of Hillary Clinton's email.

274
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
 It's not Gucciifer 2.0,

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
 but it's somebody that the FBI believes

276
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
 hacked Hillary Clinton's email.

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,360
 Not like that would have been super hard.

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
 It was, you know, just an unsecured server.

279
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,800
 But that aside, he's the guy

280
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,760
 who's under suspicion for hacking Hillary Clinton's server.

281
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
 It took him an hour once he got to cryptogram.

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,800
 Once he got this note of this coded cryptogram

283
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
 of where this gold was that people have been looking at

284
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,080
 for their entire lives for over a century,

285
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,560
 he looked at it for an hour and said,

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,920
 "Oh, here it is," and they went there

287
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
 and it was there as in a railway tunnel under Lake Pekal,

288
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,120
 and now billions, billions and billions of gold,

289
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,840
 billions of dollar, wait,

290
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,400
 what would it be?

291
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 Billions of US dollars in gold.

292
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,120
 Not billions of gold,

293
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
 but billions of dollars in gold is headed back to Russia.

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,320
 They're moving it back.

295
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,280
 So he found it and he'll probably get some sort of metal

296
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,360
 on his chest, but they won't reveal who it is

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
 because, you know, FBI's a conform.

298
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
 But interesting story.

299
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,080
 All came out of a stupid idea

300
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
 that somehow you could build a fort.

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
 I'm not denying that you could build a house out of Colgate.

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
 That may be possible if it's cold enough

303
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,080
 and it probably is cold enough over there.

304
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,040
 My question is, you just build an igloo, dude.

305
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
 Like how much Colgate would you need?

306
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
 What would be the advantage?

307
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,080
 Wouldn't that stand out more?

308
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,960
 You're looking in the woods for a bunch of Russian soldiers

309
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
 and you see like a white mound of like igloo

310
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
 and then another white mound of igloo

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
 and then you see like a red, white and blue,

312
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
 minty, fresh igloo off in the distance.

313
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
 Where are you going to check first?

314
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 Where are you going to look?

315
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
 I know they didn't have the view.

316
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,400
 You know, even if they didn't have like the red and blue

317
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
 coloring back then on the Colgate,

318
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
 you could still smell the minty freshness

319
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,520
 from across the tundra.

320
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,240
 Moose would be like licking on it and stuff.

321
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,160
 Just use ice.

322
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 The other story I wanted to talk about today,

323
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
 which was said, I've, you know,

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
 so I was looking for a, we kind of did a series last week,

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
 which was food-based conspiracies.

326
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,840
 I really liked doing that.

327
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,160
 I thought it gave a lot of structure to the show.

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
 So I was looking for stuff about murderous ghosts.

329
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
 I think that's going to be one of the next series we do.

330
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
 Ghosts who have killed people.

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,600
 And while I was looking for that,

332
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
 I actually found this.

333
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,920
 It just happened on June 4th.

334
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,200
 In Seattle, these kids were,

335
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
 there's this haunted park in Seattle.

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,520
 And they're like, hey, yeah, let's,

337
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
 let's go scooby-doo around this park

338
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
 and we'll take our flashlights.

339
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,320
 And maybe we'll see like old Mary Keller,

340
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,400
 the ghost who drowned eight babies

341
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
 and floats here every Friday the 13th or whatever.

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,400
 And I used to do stuff like that.

343
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,080
 Me and my friends used to load up in the car.

344
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,160
 Gasoline used to be 99 cents a gallon.

345
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
 So you could just drive anywhere all the time.

346
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
 And we'd go to all these sort of haunted locations in,

347
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
 in Sacramento.

348
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
 We'd visit, you know, this place would be rumored

349
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
 and this place would be rumored.

350
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
 And we'd just go to like creepy wooded areas in general

351
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,520
 to see if we could like sense anything or see anything.

352
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
 One day me and my friends were driving on the road.

353
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
 We thought we saw a civil war ghost.

354
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
 And it totally terrified us.

355
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,840
 It was this like all gray figure.

356
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,160
 And it looked like it was wearing like a confederate uniform.

357
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,600
 And it was just like walking down the street.

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
 It was super scary.

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,840
 We're like, oh my God, it's a, it's like a civil war ghost.

360
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,560
 It's civil war ghost.

361
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,200
 And we turned around.

362
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,840
 At first I thought, you know, it's just us like not,

363
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,400
 it's just all of our imaginations or whatever.

364
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,680
 So we turn around, we come back.

365
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,800
 He's still walking down the road.

366
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,840
 And it's like three in the morning.

367
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,640
 And we couldn't figure it out.

368
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,360
 And his head to toe and gray clothes, a little gray cap.

369
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
 And we're like, oh my God, it's, he's still there.

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,080
 It's the civil war ghost.

371
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,640
 And we drove back around and we came,

372
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
 this is again in the middle of nowhere.

373
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
 There was like an industrial section there.

374
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,160
 And then this long road is out in PFE, if you know the area.

375
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,760
 Out by antelope.

376
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,240
 But we come by a third time and it was a very elderly security guard.

377
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
 It was not a civil war ghost, which look, one,

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
 we probably scared the crap out of him

379
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
 because we were driving by three times.

380
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,760
 And it's not the, the most well behaved area.

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,960
 But two, thinking back to it, I think even that night we're like,

382
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,920
 why would a Confederate ghost be in Northern California?

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
 That would be quite the well traveled ghost.

384
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
 But so, you know, we did stuff like that.

385
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,240
 We'd go out to all these places.

386
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
 And this young kid named Ryan De La Cruz

387
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
 was at Martha Washington Park with some friends

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
 and they're looking around for ghosts.

389
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
 They're having a good old time, just, you know,

390
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
 having fun, being kids.

391
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,600
 And he gets shot three times.

392
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,840
 A car drives by and just opens fire on them.

393
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,360
 And the friends call 911 and the cops come

394
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
 and he's still alive.

395
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,640
 But by the time he got to the hospital, he had passed away.

396
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,760
 At this point, so that was in June 4th.

397
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
 As of today, July 24th, they have no leads

398
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
 or they're not revealing any leads.

399
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 They, it's, you know, in the article they say

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
 they don't think it's gang related.

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,960
 Generally that means that both members weren't members of gangs.

402
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,480
 It can be gang related.

403
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
 It's not considered gang related if a gang shoots a civilian.

404
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
 The only considered gang related is if one gang shoots at another gang.

405
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,080
 They don't think the man was targeted either.

406
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,120
 They think it was just, and they, it may be related to another shooting.

407
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,320
 What I think is weird is they're really keeping this close to their chest.

408
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
 The police aren't revealing many suspects about this.

409
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
 This isn't huge news.

410
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
 The only reason I stumbled across it was,

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
 and Seattle's fairly close to me.

412
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
 The only reason I stumbled across it was because I was looking for murderous ghosts.

413
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,280
 And unfortunately I stumbled across this story of a man who was murdered looking for a ghost.

414
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,040
 So, you know, it's sad and it's tragic.

415
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
 Hopefully the assholes who did this get caught.

416
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
 Because, you know, accident or not, if they just thought they were shooting in the woods

417
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
 because they were drunk hillbillies, or if they were shooting in the woods

418
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
 because they saw some people out there.

419
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,920
 You know, they, you know, there may be different levels of punishment for that,

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,240
 but, you know, they need to be taken care of.

421
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
 And, you know, obviously what's going on, these friends and stuff have to deal with this.

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:43,040
 I give it a month tops before his ghost, and I'm doing air quotes here.

423
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,440
 His ghost is haunting that area.

424
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,320
 The rumors have probably already started

425
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
 that now if you go out into the woods on a Saturday night,

426
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
 you can see his bloody body floating through the woods, which is sad.

427
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
 You know, it's easy for us to discuss ghost stories when they're hundreds of years past.

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,360
 And it's like, oh, Mary Martland fell off this bridge,

429
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,800
 and now her broken necked body comes and she tickles you.

430
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,160
 You know, that's, you know, that's easier for us to kind of deal with.

431
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,120
 But ghost stories do develop fairly quickly.

432
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
 So I'm sure his ghost story is already there.

433
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
 People are kids are like, oh, don't go out in the woods.

434
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,200
 Ryan will get you. Ryan will get you.

435
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,920
 And then of course you could always say, well, maybe nobody shot him.

436
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,240
 Maybe it was some sort of ghostly activity to shot him.

437
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,120
 I don't believe that.

438
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,320
 But again, they, you know, that rumor will spread too.

439
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
 Oh, they never caught the guys because he wasn't actually shot.

440
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
 It was this ghost attack and blah, blah, blah.

441
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,920
 The reason why I'm telling you this story is because I know a lot of you guys,

442
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,320
 if not all of you are interested in paranormal activity, ghost hunting,

443
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
 stuff like that. Be careful.

444
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,600
 I know that when we did it, when we jumped in the car and we drove to other areas,

445
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,320
 I always brought weapons with me, bats and mace.

446
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
 And California is really hard to carry a gun.

447
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,560
 I know a lot of you live in other states where that's far more permissible.

448
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,760
 But my number one fear when I was going down to those areas was dogs.

449
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
 And the second fear was hobos.

450
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,320
 I don't know if anyone uses the word hobos anymore,

451
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,040
 but you know what I mean?

452
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
 The, you know, coming across transients.

453
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,240
 My third fear was ghosts, the Blair Witch, Bigfoot, you know, the lizard man.

454
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
 But, you know, just protect yourself.

455
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
 That may not have helped it.

456
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
 They wouldn't have helped this gentleman if he had a bat.

457
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,160
 It's not really going to help him.

458
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
 But, you know, there is a level of danger when you're going into an area at night.

459
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
 There are all sorts of things that can go wrong.

460
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
 Oh, and the other thing is when I brought groups and when I was running with my friends

461
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
 in these areas, everyone had to have a cell phone on them.

462
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
 And this was a while back, so not everyone had cell phones,

463
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
 but we'd want to have at least three or four cell phones.

464
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,080
 And sometimes I even had extra cell phones because I'm not going to get into why I had

465
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,880
 extra cell phones, but you always want to have that line of communication.

466
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,640
 Because really what you're doing is you're going out into an relatively uncivilized area at night.

467
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,520
 And nobody knows where you're going because you don't know where you're going.

468
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
 You hop in the car and you're like driving around and then they're like,

469
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,640
 "Hey, yeah, let's go out to Old Potter Man's Creek and see if the ghost is still there."

470
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
 It's not like you ever had a map.

471
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
 So you want to be, this is my tips for ghost hunting,

472
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
 for doing this kind of fun ghost hunting to stay safe.

473
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
 Bring a weapon, bring a form of communication.

474
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,280
 Have fun and be aware of your surroundings at all times.

475
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,360
 That will at least give you a leg up over.

476
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
 And don't go out there drunk either, because again,

477
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
 I'm not worried about you getting drunk and getting assaulted by a ghost.

478
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,080
 I'm worried about you getting a drunk and falling down a ravine.

479
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
 Stuff like that.

480
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,840
 Trust passing, I trespassed before.

481
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 I'm not going to tell you not to trespass.

482
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
 That just comes along with the territory.

483
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
 Just be mindful of your situation.

484
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,960
 If the police show up, just be respectful and talk your way out of the situation.

485
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,800
 And if not, you get the ticket.

486
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,120
 You know, please show up.

487
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,760
 You get busted.

488
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,400
 You take the ticket.

489
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
 If someone tells you to get out, you just leave.

490
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
 That's those are my tips.

491
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
 Like that will happen.

492
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,160
 Cops show up and you're drunk and you're underage.

493
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
 Now you have a problem.

494
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
 Cops show up and you're belligerent.

495
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,760
 Now you have a problem.

496
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
 We've been stopped by the cops before.

497
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,920
 Hey, what are you doing?

498
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,040
 I'm just hunting for ghosts.

499
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,240
 Haha, you guys are idiots.

500
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,960
 Get out.

501
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
 Okay, officer.

502
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,560
 No biggie.

503
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,520
 No biggie.

504
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
 So those are my tips.

505
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,120
 I hope that the killers of this young man are caught.

506
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,080
 And I hope they're caught soon.

507
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,280
 And I hope we hope they get swift justice.

508
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
 And I hope his family finds peace.

509
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
 That's a terrible story.

510
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,920
 And I really hope people don't exploit his death to cause some sort of ghost story.

511
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,280
 But knowing neighborhood kids, they probably will.

512
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,800
 So that unfortunately just comes along with the game.

513
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,480
 So be safe when you do this stuff as well.

514
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
 So that's going to be it for today's episode.

515
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,320
 I literally, there's a puddle of water on the floor.

516
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:50,160
 And that is mostly my sweat and maybe some of my tears from having to sit in this hot, hot room.

517
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,760
 But I hope you enjoyed my sacrifice.

518
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,720
 I enjoyed doing it.

519
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 I could have done it later at night, but sometimes I like recording these day shows.

 That's my real name.

524
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,000
 We're just kind of keeping it casual with that one.

525
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,400
 We got our YouTube channel, Dead Rabbit Radio.

526
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,240
 That's where we take excerpts from this show.

527
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
 Dead Rabbit Radio is a daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

528
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

529
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,080
 We will be back tomorrow with some other great, mysterious stories for you.

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,680
 and I hope you tune in. Have a great day!
