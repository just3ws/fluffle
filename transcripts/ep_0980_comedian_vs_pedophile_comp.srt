1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
 What would you do if you were a Catholic priest and there was this possessed girl in front

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,120
 of you going "Ahhh, I like spinning around her head's like throwing up and stuff" and

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,840
 you're like "The power of Christ compels you and you're throwing holy water at her"

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,680
 but then you realize that the ghost is from Asia.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
 What would you do?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,400
 Like, "Jayson, that shouldn't make any difference."

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
 I don't know.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
 I don't know.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
 We're gonna figure that out.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,800
 And then we travel to a comedy club to meet a man who says he had the worst night of his

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 life there was.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 It wasn't Michael Richards.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,080
 That's not who we were talking about.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,560
 We go to a comedy club to meet a guy who says he had the worst night of his life ever and

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,680
 we are forced to ask ourselves the question.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,680
 What's more dangerous?

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,160
 A pedophile or a crazy pedophile?

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,320
 Day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,680
 I'm your host, Jayson Carpenter.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
 I'm having a good day.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
 I hope you guys are having a good day too.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,520
 I'm actually really re- you know like long time listeners of the show know.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
 I don't talk politics, but politics.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,160
 That's my super boy.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
 That's what I love.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
 I love politics.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,960
 I love watching all of the debates and the returns and stuff like that.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
 You're like, Jayson, you don't sound normal.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,160
 You don't sound like you normally do.

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,400
 I drink once every two years and it was last night.

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
 I drank and I'm hungover.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 I'm super hungover.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 I ate too much.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,600
 I ate too much gross food and I drink too much gross beer.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,240
 Sorry for that Budweiser sponsorship.

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
 So I'm a little hungover.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,520
 But it was fun for half of America and the other half of America.

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,600
 Probably not so fun.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 But that is my super boy.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,360
 I love crunching numbers and why I always have two or three streams.

42
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,040
 I have a conservative stream on and I have a left leaning liberal stream on and I'm going

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
 back and forth and you're like, Jayson, you just don't do an episode tonight.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
 Maybe you just don't do an episode tonight.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
 No, I want to do an episode and I got some really good stuff to talk about.

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
 And walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, bringing me some Tylenol, is one of our

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,640
 legacy Patreon supporters.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,640
 Everyone give it up for Painted Demons.

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 Woohoo!

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
 Yeah, come on into Dead Rabbit Command.

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,200
 Juggling those paint killers in that glass of water.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
 Painted Demons, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,920
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
 Trust me, I do.

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,680
 Just help spread the word about the show.

56
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
 That helps out so much.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
 It really, really does.

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,440
 If you get any value out of Dead Rabbit Radio, please pass it on.

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,680
 Also, we're coming up to the end of season 19.

60
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,640
 Friday is going to be our last episode until December 1st.

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,600
 We are going to do a Thanksgiving live stream episode.

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,320
 Thursday, November 24th at 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

63
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,480
 Join us on the YouTube channel.

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,160
 It's always a lot of fun.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,200
 And we're not going to do any classic episodes this break either.

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,400
 I'm just taking a clean break, but the classics will return in our next season break.

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,320
 Painted Demons, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,760
 Jason Jalopy, we're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,600
 Drive us all the way out to this house in the middle of the suburbs.

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,560
 Painted Demons is driving us out to this house in the suburbs.

71
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,680
 And when we get there, we hear someone screaming in the house.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,880
 They're just raising a holy hell.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 No pun intended.

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,400
 We're walking, but we notice that there's a line to get into this house.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,600
 We see a Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi and a Muslim cleric.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,720
 We see a couple of Buddhist dudes on the front lawn.

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,920
 There's a scientist there with like a scale.

78
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
 He's the hardest one.

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,840
 I guess he could be wearing a lab coat, but he also has like a little scale and an astrolabe.

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
 He goes, "I'm a scientist."

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,080
 So we're watching all of these people from all these different religious sects and then

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,920
 you know the atheist scientists, dude.

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,160
 They're all waiting for their turn to go in and we're like, "What is going on?"

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,720
 So we dress up like Mormons so we can sneak on in.

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
 We got on our little business suits and we walk in and there is a young woman with her

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 head spinning around.

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 She's throwing up everywhere.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,440
 That's kind of how I feel right now.

89
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,480
 That's kind of how I feel right now.

90
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 Her head's spinning around.

91
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
 She's throwing up everywhere.

92
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,360
 She's levitating three feet off the bed.

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,920
 Her family is in the corner crying and we see a Presbyterian minister kind of throw his

94
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,120
 shoulders up because I don't know what to do for her.

95
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
 I don't know.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,680
 I tried my best and he walks out and then in walks a shaman and he's like, "Maybe medicinal

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
 magic will work.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,080
 Maybe if I give her these mushrooms or if I give her these psychedelics, that'll cure

99
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,360
 her insanity."

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,600
 And the reason why we're kind of in this queue, we're waiting to see what happens here is

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,000
 because recently on the Patreon Discord we were having a bit of a conversation about

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:27,240
 if you had a demon from Jewish lore, would a Buddhist monk be able to wrangle that demon

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,080
 in?

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,360
 Could a priest exercise a jinn?

105
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
 Because every...

106
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 It's kind of an interesting thing and I could go on forever about it, but I can't.

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,600
 But it's kind of an interesting question because what we're basically doing is we're

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,040
 turning this world of the supernatural into Pokemon.

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,280
 Because let's say you have a demon that is one of the fallen angels that was thrown down

110
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,120
 by God during the first war for heaven.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,040
 So that is part of Christian lore.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,640
 That demon fully falls into what we know of biblical demons or Christian demons.

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,480
 Could you have a Shinto priest?

114
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:17,320
 Could you have someone from an Eastern religion use their tools and tricks to exercise a Christian

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,720
 demon?

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
 And I don't know the answer to that.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,640
 I really don't know the answer to that.

118
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,160
 On the one hand, this would be the most logical answer.

119
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
 This is kind of what we were talking about on the Patreon Discord.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,280
 It was me and Grant and Madame Gwynnar.

121
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,360
 We were having a discussion, but there's two ways to look at this.

122
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,160
 One is that the terminology may be different between a jinn and a demon and a yokai and

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,080
 all these different versions of these same creatures.

124
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,280
 The Minotaur of Greek mythology really in a sense is a Nephilim.

125
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,760
 It's an angel that came down in the book of Genesis and had sex with human women, created

126
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,920
 these monsters or these heroes.

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,040
 Really it's six of one, a dozen of another, right?

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,520
 It doesn't matter what religion it's from, that's just the terminology.

129
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,880
 A demon is a jinn.

130
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
 A demon is a demon is a demon.

131
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,840
 It doesn't matter what region of the world it's in.

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,840
 So yes, you could have a Shinto priest being able to exercise Lucifer's second in command.

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 Or you could have a Catholic priest bless a house and keep one of those butt-devouring

134
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,000
 demons that crawls out of the Japanese ponds every once in a while.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,920
 It wouldn't matter, it's just a terminology thing.

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,680
 That would be your most basic answer.

137
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,040
 And I think that's the answer that the leaders of those faiths would give those things.

138
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,640
 They probably wouldn't even address it if they walked up to a priest and said, "Hey,

139
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,440
 do you think if I got possessed by the ghost of a Buddhist monk, could you get rid of it?"

140
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
 And he's like, "I can get rid of you.

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,800
 I can get rid of you by asking you to leave."

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,280
 Also, don't talk during the sermon next time.

143
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,000
 I think that would be the typical answer, but then you do...

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,360
 I think that there might be a Pokemon-ness to it.

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,640
 Where if you don't understand that if you're over the age of seven, you don't understand

146
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
 what I mean.

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,160
 When I say Pokemon-ness, if you have a Pikachu who's an electric type, and then you have

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,200
 a Machomp who's like a punching type, there's weaknesses and their strengths.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
 So a Pikachu...

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 Let's just...

151
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,120
 I don't know much about Pokemon either, but let's just say, for example, Pikachu is very

152
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
 weak against a water type.

153
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,960
 So you would rather use your Squirtle than your Machomp to beat it, because it's weaker

154
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,240
 to that.

155
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,600
 But the Machomp is more weak against an electric type.

156
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 So then you would get the picture...

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 Okay, now I'm even getting confused.

158
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,160
 Those are the only three Pokemon I know.

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,200
 But my point is, or a...

160
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
 Remember Battlebeast?

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
 I'll never mind just forget the toy analogies.

162
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 Rock, paper, scissors.

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
 Rock, paper, scissors might be a good example.

164
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
 Where you would say no.

165
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,960
 That if there was a house haunted by a jinn, a Catholic priest could not get rid of it.

166
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,920
 It actually is from a different...

167
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,400
 Completely different theology.

168
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
 The roots are all the same, right?

169
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,680
 They're all from the Middle East.

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,520
 But Christian minister, a Jewish rabbi, and a Muslim cleric, they would be able to tack

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,720
 the demons within their theology.

172
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,320
 They'd be able to exercise those demons, but could they exercise demons from other theology?

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,680
 And really, all Islam and Judaism and Christianity, they're all based in the Middle East, so there

174
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,760
 might be some crossover there.

175
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,920
 But then talk about the Asian demons.

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,200
 Talk about the demons from India.

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,360
 The demons from Aboriginal lore or Native American lore.

178
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,560
 If someone got possessed by the trickster fox of the Native Americans, they're constantly

179
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:04,320
 pulling daffy duck stunts all day long, could a Muslim cleric get that fox out of them?

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
 I don't know.

181
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 I don't know.

182
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
 I don't...

183
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
 I think it's a super interesting question.

184
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,840
 But it's really kind of more than a thought experiment, because we see this so often in

185
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,880
 interplaces reports and demonic possessions, stuff like that, where they say, "We brought

186
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,880
 in like three or four priests to bless the house, and nothing ever worked.

187
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,360
 If anything, it made it matter."

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,320
 It's kind of a common trope in stories of hauntings and possessions, because generally,

189
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
 I'll tell you why that trope exists.

190
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
 If your house is haunted and a priest shows up and gets rid of it, well, that's the end

191
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
 of the story, right?

192
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,520
 That story's probably not even going to be in the news.

193
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,400
 Just exercise, "Okay, it might make your local news, right?

194
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,160
 If your house is haunted and a priest has to come out."

195
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 But you know what I mean?

196
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,280
 We generally, the general public, really only hears about the hauntings that get out of

197
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
 hand.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,040
 So if the priest shows up and it's gone immediately, it's just going to be something people in

199
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,600
 the family say, "Hey, Nancy's getting married.

200
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,200
 You're showing photos of her floating above the bed.

201
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,280
 Throwing up, you're like, "Oh, look at what you're marrying, Bobby."

202
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 He's like, "What?

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
 Is that Photoshop?

204
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
 Is that real?

205
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
 What's going on?

206
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,760
 She's all embarrassed."

207
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
 But I wonder if that's what could be causing it, is the reason why when you have these

208
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,760
 stories, and it's, again, super common when we look at haunted houses, where they bring

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,000
 out people, the people in the house are Southern Baptists.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,520
 They bring out a Southern Baptist minister.

211
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,360
 Southern Baptist ministers don't bless anything, but just Southern Baptist minister comes out

212
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,840
 to pray with their family and stuff like that, and the activity simply gets worse.

213
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,000
 So then they bring it out another Southern Baptist minister, because that's the faith

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 of the family that lives there, and it doesn't work.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,640
 And I'm wondering if the reason why it doesn't work is because that's not a Christian demon.

216
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,120
 I think my neighbor just busted out a chainsaw.

217
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,640
 Can you hear that?

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,920
 It's 6.20 at night.

219
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,480
 It's 6.20 at night.

220
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,160
 Just so you guys are clear when I'm recording this.

221
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 Someone's walking around the chainsaw.

222
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
 Okay, I'm going to have to move out.

223
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,280
 I'm going to have to move the studio.

224
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 Hold on a second, guys.

225
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,760
 Quality is going to change, I don't know, for the better or for the worse.

226
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,680
 Oh, he walked away.

227
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
 He walked away with the chainsaw.

228
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,280
 Yeah, I'm a good.

229
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,520
 So anyways, it's just an interesting question, because that could explain why sometimes, like

230
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,600
 even now, I'm imagining the chainsaw in my head.

231
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,360
 Okay, here.

232
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 We're going to move.

233
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 We're going to move.

234
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,760
 Okay, so we're in the living room now.

235
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
 No more chainsaw.

236
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,520
 I hope if I start hearing the chainsaw in my living room, someone's coming after me.

237
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,840
 Anyways, I just, I got one more sentence to wrap it up.

238
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,120
 It's the same sentence I've been trying to say.

239
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
 It wouldn't make sense.

240
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,720
 It wouldn't make sense why some hauntings or possessions or anything in between, right,

241
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,840
 when people call out their spiritual leaders because they're the ones living in that house.

242
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 It doesn't work.

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,600
 They're like, yeah, we consulted all these priests and we just couldn't get rid of this

244
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
 demon.

245
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,840
 It could be because the Pokemon theorem.

246
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,920
 That's what we'll call it, the Pokemon theorem, that you can only fight against demons from

247
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,120
 your canon.

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,760
 You can only fight demons that are against your God or savior.

249
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,360
 I have absolutely no proof to back this up.

250
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,440
 Just tons and tons of stories about people trying to get rid of ghosts and them not being

251
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 able to.

252
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,280
 I'm just not being able to.

253
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,400
 Which opens up a whole can of worms, right?

254
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,560
 I figure if that was the case, if I was a Jinn haunting Tanzania, I'd be like, yo, I'm

255
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,280
 going to go out to the Red Woods.

256
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,680
 I'm going to go out to the United States.

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,840
 I'm going to get a little camera and a little bag, a little bag of human souls, and I'm

258
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,560
 going to travel from a place where everyone knows how to fight me to a place where nobody

259
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,080
 knows how to fight me.

260
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
 But I don't know if it's actually true.

261
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,800
 Again, theologically speaking, you would figure the power of God should be able to overcome

262
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 any dark force.

263
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,040
 It would be very interesting though if there was this breakdown.

264
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,440
 As far as that goes, it would make sense in a sense.

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,760
 But again, if you asked any religious leader this, they'd probably be like, stop listening

266
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
 to that.

267
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
 Stop listening to that podcast.

268
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,680
 That guy obviously doesn't know what he's talking about.

269
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,920
 And then you leave and they're like, oh no, oh no.

270
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,640
 There's a bunch of demons in their office.

271
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,520
 They're like, that's why I wasn't able to get rid of these demons.

272
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,840
 They're from Indonesia.

273
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 Paint the demons.

274
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,640
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carpenter copter.

275
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,200
 We're leaving behind this suburban neighborhood.

276
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 We hope that girl gets the help she needs.

277
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,640
 That fictional girl, I made it just for an example.

278
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
 Hopefully she stops being possessed.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,920
 We're going to leave behind this suburban house.

280
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,240
 Take us all the way out to a comedy club.

281
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 We walk into this comedy club and there's a guy up on stage.

282
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
 He's cracking jokes.

283
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,240
 The audience is like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

284
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

285
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,240
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

286
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

287
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:44,240
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

288
00:15:44,240 --> 00:16:14,240
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

289
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:24,240
 Tony is sitting at this comedy club and you're sitting right next to him and he's about to experience, according to him, the worst night of his life.

290
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 Which I'm not going to argue with that at all.

291
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,240
 That is not, that might be anything, that might be an understatement.

292
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
 The worst night of his life.

293
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 So he starts off by telling us this story.

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
 He goes, listen, I have a lot of problems.

295
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,240
 I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, depression.

296
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
 That's why I'm at a comedy club.

297
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 Maybe, maybe it'll cure that.

298
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,240
 I suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, depression.

299
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,240
 He's bipolar, dyslexic as well.

300
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,240
 And he has actually been on tour with his favorite comedian.

301
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 Not like a roadie, right?

302
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
 Not like an opening act or anything like that.

303
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,240
 He's just following his favorite comedian from club to club.

304
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,240
 That actually sounds pretty dope.

305
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,240
 Not for the comedian, because he finds out that this guy's one of his fans, but it's his favorite comedian.

306
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,240
 He's been seeing all of these shows over and over and over again of this dude.

307
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 Well, one night, the worst night of Tony's life, Tony is sitting in the audience and he ruins...

308
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,240
 [laughs]

309
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 He ruins one of his favorite comedians, punchlines.

310
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
 Because he knows them all, right?

311
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,240
 This is like the fourth, fifth time he's seen this guy in a very short amount of time.

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
 He ruins one of this dude's punchlines.

313
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,240
 Listen, that would be the worst, right?

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
 It's not like singing a song where like you're like rocking in the USA.

315
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
 What? I'm rocking in the USA.

316
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
 Oh, I'm rocking in the...

317
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 And someone from the audience goes, "USA!"

318
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 You don't stop the song and go, "I'm the singer. I'm supposed to be the one singing it."

319
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,240
 They're singing you're allowed to get down with.

320
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
 They want you to sing along, right?

321
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
 But with comedian, like with a live show...

322
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
 I can see that being pretty bad, right?

323
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 The comedian comedy is all about suspense, not knowing what's coming next.

324
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,240
 If you go to a live show of Romeo and Juliet and the first act you go, "I bet you they kill each other at the ending."

325
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
 Well, first off, you'd be factually wrong. They don't kill each other.

326
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
 That'd be more interesting.

327
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
 But I bet you they both die by the end.

328
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,240
 When they mentioned StarCross lovers, I knew.

329
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
 This Shakespeare fellow is quite the heck.

330
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
 I totally knew what that meant.

331
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,240
 You know, people are like, whatever. It is annoying.

332
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,240
 But a comedian jumping on a comedian's punchlines, giving it away,

333
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 that would be bad.

334
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,240
 Well, Tony does admit to jumping on the stutes punchlines,

335
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
 but it wasn't his fault.

336
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,240
 And this is where this comes from just being an embarrassing post online.

337
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:21,240
 Like on the one hand, you could go, "Jason, you're clearly making fun of this guy who is dyslexic and has OCT or he calls it D.C.O."

338
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,240
 Okay, okay. He's dyslexic. He has OCD. He has depression.

339
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
 You're clearly, you're just going to be making fun of this guy with these things.

340
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 Well, this is where it goes from someone just writing something embarrassing online

341
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:42,240
 to where we have to start to wonder, just like Inception itself, what is real?

342
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,240
 This is a really fascinating post, because on the one hand, it was just a guy who is dyslexic

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 and people were making fun of him, whatever. I mean, I just did that multiple times.

344
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,240
 I just did that, but it's okay. I'm just dyslexic too. I can do that. I'm allowed.

345
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
 Is that all I'm doing? Is that I'm just making fun of this guy?

346
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,240
 Not necessarily, because this is so weird. And this is where it starts.

347
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 This is where you start to think, is this guy crazy?

348
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,240
 Not like crazy because he has depression, like hallucinatory.

349
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 Like, where is his reality? Where does it stop being the real world and start being life for this guy?

350
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,240
 So, traveling comedian, he's going all the shows, he does the punchline fine.

351
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,240
 Then he goes, "That wasn't my fault though. I didn't mean to jump on your punchline.

352
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,240
 Someone in this audience drugged me.

353
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:46,240
 Someone in this audience here put some sort of drug in my drink and I have no control over what I'm doing or saying.

354
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,240
 Except for this part, except for me explaining. Except for me explaining why I'm crazy.

355
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
 I can say that, but everything else.

356
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,240
 Someone drugged me and you read this and you go, "I don't think so."

357
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
 The first time I read it, you know, I had an open mind, right?

358
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,240
 But as I read it a couple of times to get it ready for the show, I thought, "No, no one drugged you."

359
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,240
 But he, in his mind, he believes that someone at the show put something in his drink for...

360
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
 Now that could be possible, right? People put stuff in people's drinks all the time.

361
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 He sees two ice cubes in there. He's like, "Ah, the madness!"

362
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
 But people do put drugs in each other's drinks.

363
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,240
 But as you read this, you start to go, "Well, why would they drug?"

364
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,240
 Like, basically he's saying they drugged his drink, not just to take advantage of him.

365
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,240
 They drugged his drink so he would ruin his favorite comedian's punchline.

366
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:49,240
 That was a small plane taking off right outside my house.

367
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 So this would be heartbreaking, right? This would be heartbreaking.

368
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:01,240
 His favorite comedian, he's up on stage, his favorite comedian, begins to bully Tony.

369
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 Begins to make fun of him, right to his face. I don't know what I would do.

370
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 If one of my heroes started making fun of me, I'm like, "No Peter Parker, no! No! You're my favorite!

371
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,240
 I was hoping you'd bite me and give me powers!" He's like, "What? This is not how it works also! You're a dork!"

372
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,240
 That would be horrible. I'd cry.

373
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,240
 But he's being made fun of by his favorite comedian.

374
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,240
 And people are physically pushing him around. You're sitting next to this guy, too. Remember?

375
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
 And kid his friend, too! Kid his friend!

376
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
 They're physically pushing him around. See, this is where I'm reading this, and I go,

377
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
 "I imagine that the comedian would start making fun of the guy."

378
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,240
 But I don't think the audience would then begin starting a mini mosh pit, but they begin pushing him around

379
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:56,240
 and Tony, whether it was because of his drug to drink or just because he got pushed a little too far that night,

380
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:05,240
 he said that he started lashing out. He said, "I let it all out. I gave into the hate."

381
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 So let's look at this from a normal person's point of view.

382
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,240
 Imagine we're sitting there in this comedy club and there's a guy up front who accidentally ruins the comedian's punchline.

383
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,240
 And the comedian makes a joker, too, about it, and then people start laughing about it,

384
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:34,240
 and you just see this guy in the front start to get quiet and a little ashamed, embarrassed, I guess would be a better word.

385
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:42,240
 And then he stood up, just out of the blue. You're like, "Okay, comedy club, the comedian's doing crowd work, whatever."

386
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:51,240
 The guy then stands up and begins to say racist things. That's what Tony said happened. He didn't give us any specifics.

387
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,240
 But he says, "I let it all out. I gave into the hate." Then he begins saying racist things, which out of context would be kind of funny

388
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,240
 because we don't know what race he's saying racist stuff to. If he all of a sudden, he starts doing all of these,

389
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,240
 he's like, "Scottish people are the cheapest people around!" We're like, "What?"

390
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 What are you talking about? They're all like, really, really old school, really, really old school racism stuff.

391
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,240
 "Oh, Irish people coming over on them boats!" We're like, "What are you talking about?" He's like, "Old school."

392
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,240
 I mean, obviously, I'm making a joke about it. This guy was probably saying some really hateful stuff.

393
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,240
 This guy probably just stood up and was just letting fly. Just letting the worst.

394
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,240
 When someone says like, "Ciderational things" and they don't give you any context, you know it's the worst, right?

395
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 You know it's absolutely the worst. He's not like, "Italians have greasy hair!" No, it probably wasn't anything like that.

396
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 It was probably, you could probably hear a pin drop in that comedy club when this guy just stood up and started screaming at racist things.

397
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,240
 And that's alarming, right? That's super alarming. And then you're like, "Mumma mia, you're eating your spaghetti."

398
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,240
 You're like, "Oh, what did he say about my mama?"

399
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,240
 Not only does he stand up and start screaming at racist things, modern-day racist things, most likely,

400
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:16,240
 he then begins to scream out that he wants to have a shootout with the police.

401
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,240
 This went from a guy ruining a punchline to now threatening...

402
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,240
 I mean, that's pretty bold, right? It's one thing to go, "I want to shoot you."

403
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,240
 So another thing to go, "Oh, I want to shoot a bunch of people. Don't clip this, lawyers. Don't clip this and use it in a trial, please."

404
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 I'm going to shoot you in the face. That's alarming, right? It depends on the situation, right? You could be playing Halo.

405
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,240
 And then it's not that alarming. But if then they go, you know someone who goes, "Oh, I'm going to shoot up a bunch of people tomorrow."

406
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,240
 Their voice changes, their voice changes whenever they say this. They're like, "Ah, it's voice changed. It's extra spooky."

407
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:04,240
 That's alarming. But when someone's willing to have a shootout with an armed force, right, you're basically taking it to 11.

408
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,240
 If someone goes, "If you're in a comedy club and someone goes, "I got a bomb on me."

409
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:18,240
 Actually, that'd be super alarming too. I was originally going to say, "That's not that scary. That would be super scary."

410
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,240
 You're just sitting in a comedy club and you're like, "This comedian bombs and so do I."

411
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,240
 And he lifts his shirt up. There's a big bomb on him. I'd give him points. I'd give him points for creativity before he blew me to some of the reins.

412
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,240
 But if someone's willing to go, it would be the same thing if someone goes, "I'm going to beat you up."

413
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,240
 I'd be like, "Okay, let's go." But if someone came up to me and goes, "I'm going to beat up Conor McGregor."

414
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
 And then I'm going to beat you up. I'm super scared now.

415
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,240
 First, he wants to fight like a super tough dude. And then I'm like the dessert. I'm the crème brûlée.

416
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,240
 I don't want to be the crème brûlée. So the fact that he's talking about wanting to have a shootout with the police, that's alarming.

417
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,240
 I mean, if any of that would be alarming to someone, if you're walking on the street and someone goes, "I'm going to shoot you in the face."

418
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 You're like, "Are you playing Halo right now?" or something. You would be alarming.

419
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,240
 But it's more alarming if you want to shoot other people with guns, like the escalation.

420
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,240
 You're like, "You're still just shaking your head. You let no Jason." It's all alarming. It's all terrifying.

421
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,240
 I don't know why you're fixated on this police shootout.

422
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,240
 Anyways, he says he begins to say modern day racist thing.

423
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,240
 "Want to have a shootout with the police?" And then one of the comedians, not his favorite comedian,

424
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 but I guess like an other comedian came in from the side and was like, "What in the world is going on out here? I'm coming up next."

425
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,240
 One type of man is happening. He comes out and the comedian says, "Give me your phone. I want to see your phone, dude."

426
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:53,240
 And Tony's like, "Oh, no, not my phone." And the comedian gets the phone from him and he goes, "Give me your code. Give me your access code for your phone."

427
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,240
 And I don't know if it was the drugs in his drink. I don't know if it's because this is a full blown hallucination.

428
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,240
 And really in Tony's mind, he's probably just sitting in the comedy club and he just gets up, starts to swear. I mean, I don't know. This is so weird.

429
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 Tony then give, he felt so threatened by this guy, he gave the comedian, this other comedian, the password to his phone.

430
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,240
 And the comedian's like, "Dude, he's the first off. He's the lame password." And he starts making fun of the guy.

431
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,240
 The audience is all laughing. They're writing down his password. They're like, "Get his pin number too."

432
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,240
 The comedian gets his pin number and goes through his phone. And again, you thought this was going to get any weirder, right?

433
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:46,240
 First off, there is this guy, this depressed guy sitting in a comedy club, which is just like a painting. That's like a painting you'd see some college freshmen having, right?

434
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,240
 He messes up the guy's joke and they just say the rest of the stuff. This is where it hits 11. Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier,

435
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:04,240
 the comedian starts going through his phone and he, Tony says, "Listen, there was no child porn on it."

436
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,240
 Which, it should just be a given, right? It should just be a given on every phone.

437
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,240
 You shouldn't have to say that because it shouldn't exist on anybody's phone.

438
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:26,240
 But when somebody is telling you about their phone, when somebody is telling you about their phone and they go, "Well, there's no child porn on it."

439
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,240
 I don't know. I would quantify that. I mean, good, right? That's a good thing.

440
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,240
 But then I would start to think, "Is this a good thing? Are you saying there's no child porn on it now?"

441
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,240
 What it used to be, I don't know. I don't know. He has to clarify.

442
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,240
 There was no child porn on the phone, but this is a sentence you never want to add a butt to, right?

443
00:29:49,240 --> 00:30:04,240
 There's no child porn on my phone, but he did have screenshots and saved videos of kids and teens from YouTube and Instagram.

444
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:13,240
 And, oddly enough, that's already, you're like, "Whoa, Jason, you totally dropped a bomb on him. I wasn't expecting this at all."

445
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:21,240
 He has basically, he's watching YouTube videos and taking screenshots and saving those onto his phone.

446
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:29,240
 Apparently, he's taking these screenshots of kids and teens when he's watching YouTube videos and keeping them on his phone.

447
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,240
 Well, they find these pictures, which, according to him, is not child pornography.

448
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,240
 I mean, I mean, I guess that's a philosophical question at a certain point.

449
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,240
 If you're using, if it's a photo of a kid and you're using it for lurid purposes, it may not be illegal,

450
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,240
 but I don't think you can honestly, I don't think he would pass a lie detector test if they asked you, "Do you have any child porn on your phone?"

451
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:06,240
 He's like, "No." But then he has like 50 gigabytes of just screenshots of not child porn.

452
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,240
 He also has notes on his phone. Like, he's been writing a novel, writing these little short stories on his phone.

453
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,240
 He says he talks about the dreams he has involving girls from the photographs.

454
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,240
 So he was writing basically fan fiction for these screenshots.

455
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:31,240
 He's like, "That's it. My niece is no longer allowed on YouTube. I'm shutting the account down. They're getting all shut down."

456
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:40,240
 You know, this is the reason why they had to remove comments from kids' videos on YouTube, because these perverts were writing down screenshot numbers.

457
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:51,240
 So like, 29 Seconds In is a perfect shot, and you could just click on that and it would bring you right to the shot where she's doing like a somersault or a backflip and the, da-da-da-da-da.

458
00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:01,240
 That's why they removed that. Because people were taking innocent videos and basically freeze framing them and turning them into stuff like this.

459
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,240
 Right? I don't want to get into the details. I think you can use your imagination.

460
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,240
 But yeah, that's why YouTube no longer allows those comments on them.

461
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,240
 He said, "Listen guys, because he's defending himself now. Basically he's surrounded."

462
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,240
 And that's the question though. Is this physically happening or is this all in his head?

463
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
 Because it gets even worse.

464
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,240
 What Jason, there's no...

465
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:34,240
 Jason, first of all, I don't think it can get worse. And secondly, if it does, I don't want to hear anymore. I don't want to hear anymore.

466
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
 Don't tell me it gets worse.

467
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,240
 Well, I mean, just imagine, I can't put myself in this guy's shoes, but a comedian, a guy who specializes in the same funny stuff at the drop of a hat,

468
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,240
 has your phone, not your phone, that's gross, but has somebody's phone and it has not just screenshot.

469
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,240
 Enough that it's noticeable. Right?

470
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:03,240
 If there's a screenshot of like one Dallas Cowboy cheerleader in a folder on your phone,

471
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
 no one's going to accuse you of stalking the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

472
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:15,240
 But if there are so many photographs of the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders that all someone has to do is open your phone, right?

473
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,240
 Just literally put in the password and it pops up and all your icons, all your icons are of Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

474
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,240
 Your wall screens, Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, every... I mean, it would have to be that obvious.

475
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,240
 I don't think they said grab his phone and you download a download a file search program.

476
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
 We're going to scrub his phone. We're going to find everything.

477
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,240
 It had to be noticeable enough that they just turned it on and they go, "What?"

478
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:47,240
 Anyways, they have this phone with all of these photographs and these detailed vivid dreams.

479
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,240
 He's had quote unquote dreams, right? These vivid dreams he has about these girls.

480
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,240
 Again, he can't take any responsibility for it. He's obviously like into this disgusting stuff, but he's like, "Oh, no, no, no.

481
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
 It was just the dreams." And they're like, "Why did you write it down?"

482
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
 And he goes, "Because I was drunk. I was drunk. I'm drunk all the time."

483
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:12,240
 He says, he's very clear to us. This is not reassuring, but he goes, "Listen, guys, I haven't talked to a minor.

484
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,240
 I have not talked to a minor for five years."

485
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
 And they're like, "Why'd you have the last part? Why'd you have the last part?"

486
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,240
 He should have just said, "Never, ever. You've never talked to anyone under the age of 18."

487
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:36,240
 And again, he's talking about when people say teens, a normal person goes, "Oh, like a 16, a 17, an 18-year-old girl."

488
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,240
 No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what these perverts are into.

489
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,240
 That's the problem with terms like child porn.

490
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,240
 The average person goes, "Oh, is it like Sherry Lorde's? Is it like some 16-year-old girl who looks like she's 19?"

491
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,240
 That's not what this is. This is like pre--- they use the term teen.

492
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 It's the same thing when someone asks you, "How often do you drink?"

493
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,240
 If you say sometimes, that means a lot.

494
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,240
 And if you say rarely, that means sometimes.

495
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,240
 And if you say never, that means rarely. Like, I always say never. I drink once every two years.

496
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:13,240
 So people kind of always downplay what they do. These are young girls.

497
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,240
 Anyways, he says it's not like he had spent five years since he talked to someone who was 18 or 17 years old.

498
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
 We're talking like 13, probably most likely 13 and under.

499
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,240
 If anybody hasn't talked to one in five years, you gotta give him a brownie point.

500
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 Not a brownie point. Not a brownie point.

501
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 The brownies are safely back in their clubhouse.

502
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,240
 He says, "Listen, and before anyone thinks I'm a pervert," which he stated this real late in the game, right?

503
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:43,240
 We're already believing this stuff. He goes, "Listen, before anyone thinks I'm a pervert, I want to be very, very clear about something.

504
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:52,240
 I have never, ever paid any of them to have sex with me."

505
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,240
 But, again, this is not a time you want to use the word "but." He's never, ever, ever.

506
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:07,240
 What type of monster do we think this guy is? He has never, ever, ever offered one of these girls money to have sex with him.

507
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:14,240
 But, he has offered to take them on dinner dates.

508
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
 That's not... No, it's gonna go all okay then.

509
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
 You're not... You don't have some crippling mental illness.

510
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,240
 You just want to date the 13-year-old girl. You don't want to pay money for your...

511
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,240
 Like, how was that? In his mind, I'm sure that is a... See, look, I'm a good guy, man.

512
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,240
 I'm gonna go on on dates. I don't know what his thought process is. They're both terrible.

513
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,240
 Anyways, well, he's about to get his wish. Somebody... Not... Not that wish. Not that wish.

514
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,240
 There's some nine-year-old in the audience. She's like, "I kind of like the cut of this guy's gym."

515
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,240
 No. Somebody called the cops. Somebody called the cops in for a man who wanted to have a shootout with the police.

516
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:05,240
 That wish. Somebody calls the cops and when the cops show up, according to him...

517
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,240
 And I don't... I'll be honest. I don't put this past the police. I don't put this past the police at all.

518
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:18,240
 But according to him, the police, when they showed up, beat him up.

519
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,240
 He says that they beat him up. They stomped on him. They choked him.

520
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,240
 They spit on him. And... This is so interesting. I didn't even think about this when I wrote this down.

521
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,240
 This actual... His actual quote was, "Beat, stomped, choked, spit on, and..."

522
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,240
 This really goes to show his mind state. Think about everything that's happened to him up to this point.

523
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:50,240
 And when the cops show up, he gets beat, stomped, choked, spit on, and humiliated.

524
00:37:50,240 --> 00:38:02,240
 Like, that's the way he ends his list of assaults. Humiliated.

525
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,240
 That seems to be the worst thing for him. That seems to be the thing he fears the most.

526
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,240
 And that's kind of what this whole night has been. It's a humiliation ritual.

527
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,240
 Then he also said, "And then they made fun of him, and then he goes on and says, 'They pushed me down some stairs.'

528
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,240
 Which again, I don't put that... I'm not going, 'What? The police?' They would never do that.

529
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
 This guy's putting false allegations against law enforcement. Look, I'm up.

530
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,240
 I'm pretty sure that happened. I'm pretty sure the cops showed up and were like,

531
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,240
 'Oh, let me see your phone real quick.' And then they pushed him down the stairs.

532
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 And they don't put that past the police department. If they get a call, there's a child molester here who said he wanted to shoot cops.

533
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,240
 I'm pretty sure you're going to get pushed down the stairs, right?

534
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,240
 Beats, stomped, choked, spit on, humiliated, and they push him down the stairs.

535
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 And then he goes. He didn't get a ticket. He didn't get arrested. He didn't get a ticket.

536
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,240
 Which makes sense too, right? Because then the cops got a process paperwork.

537
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,240
 And they'd have to explain where they got called down to this comedy club.

538
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,240
 And this dude looks like he just went three rounds with two police officers.

539
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 But what happened, again, this all ties back to the humiliation thing. According to him,

540
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,240
 all of this stuff, because he's in a comedy club, right? He's in a comedy club.

541
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,240
 There's cameras everywhere. You got 30 or 40 witnesses to all this stuff.

542
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
 They got their cell phone cameras.

543
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,240
 Apparently video of this, which I would easily pay money for.

544
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
 I would love to see video footage of this.

545
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
 But here's the thing. I don't even know if this happened.

546
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,240
 Not that he made the story up. I'm wondering how much of this is just in his head.

547
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,240
 That he actually went to the comedy club and just had a psychotic break.

548
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,240
 But anyways, he said that this video footage of this event, this happened back in like 2021.

549
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,240
 He goes, the video footage of this event was posted on his social media.

550
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,240
 And he's afraid of vigilante attacks. He's afraid of vigilantes coming after him.

551
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,240
 He posted this this year, back in June of 2022.

552
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,240
 He's posting it because he was saying, my uncle's car recently got vandalized.

553
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,240
 I think it's because of vigilante attacks. And here's why.

554
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,240
 And then he just typed out this insane story, which he invites more vigilante attacks.

555
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:37,240
 Right. Anyways, he posted this up and he's afraid that he's a target of vigilante attacks.

556
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:45,240
 He's thinking of suing. I don't know if that's specifically the comedy club or the comedians or the police or everybody.

557
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,240
 The Italians. I don't know exactly who he's thinking about suing, but he's thinking of suing.

558
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
 Everyone's constantly thinking of suing in America. That means nothing.

559
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,240
 He has met with a lawyer, which again, I would have paid money.

560
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,240
 I would ask the lawyer, hey, how much do you charge an hour?

561
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,240
 Okay, I will have to sit in this room while you talk to this new client.

562
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,240
 He's like, what? Okay, I love money. That's why I'm a lawyer and you're sitting there and this Tony dude walks in and sits down and goes,

563
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,240
 so let me tell you what happened the other night.

564
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,240
 Just to watch the lawyer's face. The lawyer's like, oh man, I've seen some stuff in my life, but this is insane.

565
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,240
 He's thinking about suing. He met a lawyer. He's currently back in therapy, which is good, right?

566
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,240
 If you need therapy, it's good to be there and probably stay there because he went back.

567
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,240
 So that means he stopped at some point and he's going into rehab, which is good too.

568
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,240
 It's funny because rehab, I think of drug and alcohol stuff, but maybe it's even darker than that.

569
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,240
 He obviously has some mental problems.

570
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,240
 Allegedly, Tony, if you try to sue me, trust me, you don't want me on the stand test if I need to get to you.

571
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,240
 It's a terrifying story. It's a fascinating story. It's a story of mental illness.

572
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,240
 It's a story of people attacking a stranger in public, maybe.

573
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:18,240
 It's a story of a psychotic break, possibly.

574
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,240
 But either way, it's just fascinating, right? It's a look at the world that we don't have, that most people...

575
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:34,240
 I mean, listen, I'll get lost in the dream world from time to time, but I don't think I've ever confused the dream world with reality.

576
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,240
 Well, I guess I don't know if he has either, and you say that he did that, but I have no proof of that.

577
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:50,240
 But I can see that happening, but it's fascinating because I think that all of us, even though we're not perfect,

578
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,240
 even though we have our own challenges, like I said at the beginning, I'm dyslexic.

579
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,240
 I have severe learning disorder when it comes to math.

580
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:03,240
 Recently on an episode, I tried to do 60 minus 15, and I got it wrong.

581
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,240
 I said it was 44. That wasn't a bit. I actually left that in, and I was laughing, and I go,

582
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,240
 "I think people should know exactly how bad I am at math."

583
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,240
 Like, that wasn't a bit. Originally, I was going to edit that out, and when I was listening back to it, I was laughing so hard.

584
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
 I have a really hard time with math.

585
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,240
 I have double vision. I have time dysmorphia.

586
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,240
 I've had multiple concussions throughout my life. I'm probably somewhere on the spectrum.

587
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,240
 I think pretty much everyone is on the spectrum other than a very few people.

588
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:38,240
 I think most people are probably on the autism spectrum from one into another, but we all suffer from it.

589
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,240
 I think no one's perfect, right? We all suffer from our own things, but even with all that added up,

590
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,240
 even with all the stuff that I've gone through, I had a heart attack when I was a baby.

591
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,240
 My mom denies that story. She goes, "No, you didn't."

592
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,240
 And I go, "Well, that's what my medical report says. You guys didn't have a heart attack when you were a baby."

593
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:05,240
 Anyways, we all have our issues, but when you meet someone who's truly, truly either having a psychotic break

594
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:13,240
 or is in the real world interpreting events so differently, you can't tell if it's all made up or a little bit made up.

595
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,240
 I don't know if this was a full psychotic break, which to me is scarier.

596
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,240
 Imagine sitting next to someone and they're playing this whole thing out in their head, this whole scenario.

597
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,240
 You're just sitting there and he blows a punchline and the comedian goes, "Up yours, buddy."

598
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,240
 He comes to a couple of my shows, "I think you need to get a life."

599
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:42,240
 And then the comedian goes on with the rest of his show and you're just sitting next to this guy and he's descending into a world of make-believe.

600
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,240
 This whole story happens in his mind. None of it's real.

601
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:55,240
 But he's sitting there in the nightclub and he's imagining standing up and hurling out these words and he's imagining about going,

602
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,240
 "And I'll shoot all the police. Send them all down."

603
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:09,240
 And what's even weird about that is if that's the case, if this wasn't real story, if it was all in his mind, even in his own dream world,

604
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:22,240
 he's humiliated, he's mocked, he's beat up by the police, even in this psychotic break, he's still the victim.

605
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,240
 Which I guess not to say it. I don't think many psychotic breaks are relaxing.

606
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
 I think they're called psychotic for a reason.

607
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
 I honestly don't know what's scarier.

608
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:38,240
 We know as people how to deal with perverts and weirdos and sickos and stuff like that.

609
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,240
 We know how to deal with them. Generally it's just to avoid them.

610
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:49,240
 But if it's made up, if it's all in his head, it's just fascinating to see the world through their eyes.

611
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:58,240
 And again, you have that perfect balance like a Max Kramer type character where you have someone who's crazy enough that it lets you see the world through the eyes of a crazy person,

612
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:05,240
 but also sane enough to be able to spell words correctly and write out sentences that are comprehensible.

613
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,240
 Like sometimes you don't have that second part, it's just the ramblings of a madman.

614
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,240
 This you could understand.

615
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,240
 So just a fascinating look at mental illness and psychosis and comedy clubs.

616
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:24,240
 Comedy clubs, I guess the moral of the story is don't jump on your favorite comedian's punchlines,

617
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,240
 because they may find a not-child porn on your phone.

618
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
 I guess that's the moral that Tony learned.

619
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
 But yeah, this guy's still out there and who knows how the story's going to end. He hasn't posted anymore.

620
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:41,240
 I'm pretty sure his account is deleted, so we'll never know if anyone else starts posting is him again.

621
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,240
 You know, is it just a fake?

622
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,240
 We don't know if he ever stayed in therapy and got the help that he needed.

623
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,240
 We don't know if he left therapy because he left it already, right?

624
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,240
 He said I went back to therapy. He might have left therapy and started taking more screen shots from YouTube.

625
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,240
 And again, that's a band-aid.

626
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,240
 If your brain is so warped that you think that's okay,

627
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,240
 then the only reason why you're not looking at child porn is because it is illegal at that point.

628
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,240
 You're still using it for the same purpose.

629
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
 So we don't know. Maybe he got rid of all that stuff.

630
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,240
 He's like he's giving that phone away. He's like hey, you want a free phone?

631
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,240
 Some hobo's like yeah, sure. And he's like oh, this is horrible.

632
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,240
 We don't know if he got rid of all that stuff. We don't know if he kept descending down that dark road.

633
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:38,240
 We don't know if he got the help that he needed or we don't know if he had a shootout with the police.

634
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,240
 Like we don't know. We'll never really know how this story ends.

635
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,240
 If he's still alive and he's still going through these delusions,

636
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,240
 he's in this world where vigilantes are around every corner.

637
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
 And anything bad that happens to him, it's because of the vigilantes.

638
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,240
 And that's just gangstalking at that point.

639
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,240
 Like this is just one of those crazy stories. It was one night in this guy's life, the worst night of his life.

640
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,240
 And I agree. If this story is even halfway through, it is the worst night of his life.

641
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,240
 And it will continue to impact him for years and years because every bad thing that happens to him,

642
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:21,240
 he's going to chalk up to these vigilantes who watched clips on social media of people rummaging through his phone.

643
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,240
 Which I don't even know if that exists. It's so bizarre.

644
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,240
 It's so weird. Imagine if that video footage doesn't even exist if it's all made up.

645
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,240
 But he's imagining anything bad happening to him is because of video footage that doesn't exist.

646
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,240
 It really kind of boggles the mind. I love this story.

647
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,240
 The content's a little rough, especially for this close to the end of the season,

648
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,240
 but it's such a fascinating look at mental illness. Such a fascinating look at psychosis.

649
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:57,240
 And we're still left wondering how much of it was real and what happens next.

650
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:04,240
 How does this story end? And those are questions that will never be answered.
