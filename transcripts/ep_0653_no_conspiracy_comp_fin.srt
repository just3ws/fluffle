1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 A trio of true crime stories that'll really make you consider

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,880
 Existing on the planet earth you'll really wonder about whether or not you want to stick around you should

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:18,320
 But you'll question it and then we travel back to the conspiracy theory iceberg to look at the only conspiracy theory worth researching

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,720
 There is no conspiracy theory today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
 *Music*

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:36,800
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I can barely say that with a straight face, but I hope you guys are having a great day and hope you guys can say it with a straight face

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
 It's so hot in here. I'm recording in the haunted closet

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 That's not like the name of a studio if I'm recording in the literal haunted closet

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,680
 I gotta run my AC and shut it off come in come into a place where the dead has not departed to record this podcast for you

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,920
 The temperature goes up immediately. I don't even know why they're running the AC for an hour before

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,680
 Recording each episode, but I'm here for you guys. You know who else is here for us. He never leaves us alone

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,120
 He's always hanging out in the most convenient part of our body

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,520
 Is there an in is there an inconvenient part of the bunny stick your finger up your nose?

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,800
 I want you to pick out our newest patreon supporter. It's boogers. Everyone give a round of applause to boogers you pull him out

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,400
 He's like my he's like this is not what my name means. I'm not a booger

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,460
 I don't know boogers. Maybe it's like a ghost of a guy named Gus that

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,360
 Little less disgusting so pick your nose pull out a booger name it Gus boogers

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,800
 You are gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you guys aren't a booger

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 That's it's preferable, but just helps her the word about the show really really helps out a lot

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
 I actually didn't say that in the last episode with Robert Reith

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
 He was the village person dressed up as a carpenter if you're not a village person

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,760
 If you don't have a sexy carpenter outfit like Robert Reith or you're not a booger like boogers

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,520
 totally fine

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,760
 Both are preferable if you're not those things just helps read the word about the show really really helps out a lot

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,920
 Robert Reith we're waving goodbye to him as he fades away like a force ghost and boogers

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
 We're gonna toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,760
 We're leaving behind dead rabbit command take your salty gooey hands put all over the controls for the next person has to play

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,360
 The dirgeable we are leaving behind dead rabbit command. We are headed out to a courthouse

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,760
 We got a court date dude. This kind of sucks

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,320
 So the other day a patreon

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,160
 I'm not gonna say who was was driving the Jason Jalopy a little too fast a little too wild got a traffic ticket now because we're all

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,840
 Fluffle because we're all a family of rabbits. We all have to attend the court hearing and

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,200
 We're here in court. Well while we're in this courthouse. We're gonna fight this speeding ticket. We get an elevator ding and

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,640
 Listen man, I've been to court a couple times myself and I've had friends who've gone to court

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,800
 Everyone's miserable every single person at the courthouse is miserable the person working in the cafeteria is miserable

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,560
 The judges are miserable. It's not a great place to be I was in court

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,800
 I was in court when I ran into a solar plexus clown glider. It's a bad place

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
 Interdimensional

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,520
 Creatures hang out in court rooms. I'll put that episode in the show notes

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,840
 But ah you don't want to go to court or have anything to do with court or watch the show night court actually that show is pretty funny

42
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
 I can't make a joke about that being bad

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
 We're in this courthouse

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,040
 You just want to get the speeding ticket taken care of this very long introduction for three very short stories

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
 But we want to get this speeding ticket taken care of we're in this elevator now

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,620
 We know every time this door opens a weirdo is gonna get inside

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:54,920
 Because that's how the story is framed and that's what happens in real court houses ding elevator door opens and inside steps. Oh

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,460
 Good this guy is actually a US Marshal

49
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,920
 His name is David Timothy moon and we're like, oh, what do you hear for and he's like, oh, you know

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 I'm a US Marshal so I like do Marshal stuff and we're like, okay, that makes sense

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
 Maybe he'll protect us for the rest of this

52
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,440
 Adventure there. We're on this very linear and this very vertical adventurer on we go up another story

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,160
 the elevator opens up

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,580
 The elevator opens up and inside steps

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,080
 Ronnie Lou Helton. He's 73 year old man. So we see this old man walk in he looks like the dude from up

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,200
 He's just kind of saunter's in and so we know where the marshals here. He's obviously working. We ask hey Ronnie

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,000
 What are you here for and he turns to us and he says so the other day?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
 This is totally blown out of proportion

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,280
 Proportion and everything I'm about to say is alleged because I haven't been found guilty of anything yet

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,920
 But on April 7th, 2021 so very recently I was minding my business in Corbin, Kentucky

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,720
 And I was walking through a neighbor

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,280
 I don't want to tell this story from his point of view

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,760
 It's gonna sound super creepy because I have to keep saying I did this stuff

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,280
 So this dude named Ronnie Lou Helton was living in Corbin, Kentucky, and he's walking down the street

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,440
 He's walking through the Gordon Hill Pike neighborhood. It's 4 p.m

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,840
 This is prime time to be like hanging out doing little kid stuff playing with GI Joe's or Paw Patrol or whatever kids play with these days

67
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,000
 There's a little three-year-old boy in the backyard. Look at me grandma. I'm a three-year-old boy

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,880
 I don't have imagination yet. I don't know if I'm a jet or a knight

69
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,240
 The grandma's like oh great this kid's gonna be a struggle. Three-year-old boys running around his grandma's backyard

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,080
 Now Ronnie is walking through the neighborhood and he has predator vision

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,920
 Not predator vision like he'd vision, literal like sexual predator vision. He's like he just sees normal

72
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,400
 He just sees normal. There's no like red heat signature, but it's just creepier

73
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,720
 He sees this three-year-old boy running in the backyard and he walks up to the fence

74
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,800
 Hey, how would you like to come over the fence Ronnie says and the boy's like, you know, probably not and

75
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,960
 Ronnie reaches over the fence grabs the boy's hand and starts to lead him along the fence line now Ronnie's a short man

76
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,160
 Ronnie's about five foot one and

77
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
 The boy is three years old so he's obviously short so we're talking like a picket fence

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,800
 But Ronnie's really not tall enough to reach over and grab the boy, but he noticed there's a part where the

79
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,360
 Ground on the boy side of the fence kind of

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,960
 Lumps up and the fence is technically shorter at that point

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,880
 So he's leading the boy over to this lump

82
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,260
 And he means to pick the boy up and run away with him as this is going on the grandma who's supposed to be babysitting this kid

83
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,480
 Looks out and sees

84
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,160
 Ronnie leading this kid down the fence line and she goes let go of my son

85
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,600
 My grandson, let go my grandson. She's easily confused

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,520
 Ronnie let's go with the boy the boy runs deeper into the safety of the yard

87
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,600
 Now stranger abductions. They're super rare. They do happen. They're terrifying, but that's not even the end of this incident

88
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,560
 To make it even creepier. I mean this is like 4 p.m. It's so casual

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
 You have to think that this guy has done this before

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,880
 Allegedly he then yells to the grandmother quote all give you a

91
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,200
 thousand dollars

92
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 for this little boy

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
 unquote

94
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,680
 That's really creepy the fact that he knew that he had a number

95
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,560
 He's probably in the past been like I'll give you 750 dollars and they're like no dice and they're running away

96
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 And he's like, hmm, maybe I should up it next time

97
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,840
 He's obviously

98
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,720
 Doesn't done this enough times to know a thousand dollars is the sweet spot

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,480
 He yells out I'll give you a thousand dollars for this boy

100
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,840
 They say no like you should and the guy then turns and gets in his car, which was just parked right there

101
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,040
 They get his license plate number. They turn it over to cops the guys arrested. He's actually charged with attempted kidnapping and

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,400
 Because he yelled out a price. He actually got charged with human trafficking as well

103
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,120
 We're standing in this elevator here with this man who tried to abduct a three-year-old boy and then offered a

104
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,840
 $1,000 price tag for the boy and it's so funny because if it was just the kidnapping I probably wouldn't even cover it

105
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 I'm like boring

106
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
 Who then tries to kidnap a three-year-old out of a yard

107
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:23,160
 Call me later when you find out the old man's really a skinwalker or something interesting the fact that he's yelling out a price makes it so chilling

108
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,680
 To me. He's probably bought kids before

109
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,360
 Allegedly

110
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,640
 Allegedly, there's a US Marshal in this elevator. I gotta be careful what I say legally, but it's just creepy

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,720
 It's so and the fact that he thought the grandma would go you almost tried stealing my grandson

112
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,520
 But now that you offered me a thousand dollars come in for some tea. Let's talk

113
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,480
 No, he's awaiting some serious serious charges

114
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
 So we're now in this elevator with this man who tried kidnapping this little kid. That's not cool

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,920
 It's more than uncool it's disgusting, but the elevator we're still stuck in it

116
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,560
 The door opens up another man gets on into the elevator steps

117
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,720
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin. It's a 59 year old home inspector

118
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,160
 We go hey, we don't learn our lesson by asking the first guy what he was in for we ask this guy

119
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,000
 What are you in for and he goes? Oh man, you guys won't believe it

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,240
 Well, you guys probably will because there's video evidence of it

121
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,240
 But this is my story and then he does wavy lines and we're flashbacked into this memory of his reluctantly

122
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,840
 We do not want to be in this memory. It's March 12th

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,600
 2021 again super recent

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,360
 Those chemtrails are finally starting to catch up with everyone and infecting their brains. We're in Oxford Township, Michigan

125
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,600
 Kevin Wayne Van Levin is a home inspector and he is doing what his name implies. He's inspecting a home

126
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,880
 He's looking at it and he goes yeah

127
00:09:50,880 --> 00:10:00,360
 Four walls four walls a ceiling perfect. Check that down. There does seem to be some sort of foundation or floor

128
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,080
 Yeah, it's a floor

129
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,720
 He's very very good at his job. He's very thorough

130
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,040
 So when he's doing his home inspecting the people whose home he's inspecting they say we're gonna go out get a bite to eat

131
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,240
 You do your thing but when they did leave him they didn't expect what was gonna happen

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,040
 But they had a video camera and so they're out grabbing a quick bite to eat and all of a sudden

133
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,760
 Their phone goes off there they're like tone goes off their phone and it shows that they had movement in

134
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 their babies nursery

135
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,320
 And they're like, oh no, we forgot the baby. I don't know like he's a home inspector. He's walking around the home

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,400
 Why would you even care that motion sensors were going off?

137
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,840
 It pops up on their phone that there's motion in the nursery and the mother she goes

138
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,040
 I didn't really I didn't I wasn't really bothered by it, but for some reason I

139
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,620
 Decided to look at the video and this is the video we have we see Kevin walk into the nursery. It's very very nice

140
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,560
 Nursery, it's I didn't even know was a nursery doesn't have like the

141
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,360
 stereotypical crib and like the haunted rocking chair and stuffed animals

142
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,080
 It looks more like some weird art deco room

143
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,160
 So that's gonna have a real imaginative life, but anyways, it looks very

144
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,640
 Spartan as a nursery

145
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:27,120
 Now this is now an interior design podcast you wouldn't know is a nursery except for the fact that this man Kevin picks up an Elmo doll

146
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
 this tickle me Elmo doll and

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,800
 He is walking around the Elmo doll and then he turns his back to the camera and he's kind of like in the closet now and

148
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,280
 he is

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,080
 Humping Elmo and you go Jason. How how do you know?

150
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,280
 How do you know if he has his back to the camera and he's halfway in the closet? How can you tell?

151
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,400
 well, you can you can tell right you can tell from the motion of his arm and

152
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,360
 Almost moments of ecstasy. Oh tickle me harder. You can tell he's banging this this doll

153
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,920
 Now he might have known there was a camera there

154
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:14,360
 I hope he didn't know he did turn his body enough that he was trying to conceal it from something

155
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,000
 But not so much that you can you that you know, right when you see the arm kind of moving not Elmo's arm

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,840
 but Kevin's arm and

157
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,520
 Then you see Elmo smoking his cigarette afterwards

158
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,520
 He uses this Elmo doll to masturbate on and then to make things worse

159
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,160
 He puts the Elmo doll back where he found it

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,760
 So the idea was that no one would be the wiser except for him and Elmo and there would just be this

161
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,520
 Soaking disgusting Elmo in the corner of this nursery

162
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,720
 Well, they were watching it. They're watching it live

163
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,520
 They called the police the police actually apparently according to this article. I read on the mail online

164
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,320
 By Lauren Lewis the police I believe got there as he was leaving and

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,520
 He said oh, no, no, I totally wasn't

166
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,080
 How do you how do you come back from that?

167
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,280
 You're just standing there and two police officers show up and they're like, hey, are you Kevin van Levin and he goes

168
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,360
 Yeah, yeah, that's me and they go. Did you have sex with?

169
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,040
 You immediately would think how did they know how did they know?

170
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:27,240
 Red fur all over your crotch. You know, how would they know you wouldn't think to come up with a cover story that quickly for that, right?

171
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,840
 So he does though apparently he's like no, no, no, it was totally consensual. Elmo. Okay. Want to me?

172
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
 He denies it. He totally denies it

173
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,720
 But then they say well, there's video of you and then he's like, okay, you caught me guys

174
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 You hold his hands up to me handcuffed. They're like, we don't want to touch your hands. You know what you're just doing

175
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,800
 So he is facing

176
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,680
 What was the it was a weird mischief vandalism or misdemeanor

177
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,160
 Malicious vandalism and it carries like a two-year sentence and I think because there's the sex angle to it

178
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,840
 an odd part of his bond he's not in jail right now. He's able to bond out one of his

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,680
 conditions of his bond is he can't be in a

180
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,080
 House that he doesn't own that kind of makes him like a vampire, right?

181
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,240
 I think he can't come in your house without special permission. There's this zombie apocalypse. They're like come in come in

182
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,000
 He's like I can't the law doesn't allow it, but he goes in the eyes in a toy factory

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,120
 He's like you guys wait there. They're like a food supermarket. He's like I'm gonna go to this stuffed animal factory

184
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,840
 Woohoo the apocalypse has done me right. I will have to say this though the home and I thought this was very noble of

185
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:40,280
 Kevin he's a home inspector. He's in someone else's home. It's March 12th, 2021 as he's sexually assaulting Tickle me Elmo

186
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
 He's wearing a mask

187
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,980
 He is very courteous of COVID restrictions that it's salute to you Kevin

188
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:58,200
 hats off hats off to you the fact that while you were committing this disgusting crime you continued to wear a mask

189
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,920
 He should be an example for us for us all

190
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
 So there we go. We got two

191
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,240
 Creepy stories from these weirdos legend weirdos that we ran into this courthouse

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,080
 But I said there was a trio of stories and we're looking around. I'm looking at you. I'm checking

193
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:22,440
 Have you been delmo recently? You have no fur on your crotch good to go then we realized the grossest story has been here all along

194
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:31,200
 Deputy US Marshal David Timothy moon has been lurking behind us the whole time. He wasn't lurking. We knew he was there

195
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,580
 He was eating a ham sandwich. He's like hey, I'm still here May 2019

196
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,840
 David Timothy moon

197
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
 50 year old man

198
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,080
 24 year veteran of

199
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,980
 The US Marshals this guy had a long career. He actually didn't even answer to the local

200
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,840
 Deputy Marshals in Phoenix, Arizona, which is where this story takes place. He his bosses were in DC

201
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 This guy was a highfalutin dude

202
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,000
 But even highfalutin US Marshals gotta buy houses

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 They have places to live. They don't live in yurts. They have to live in a home

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,260
 So when US Marshal David Timothy moon

205
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,080
 Was house hunting? He's like oh this place looks great. The neighborhood looks awesome. I read that thing about home inspectors

206
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,160
 They're supposed to have four walls and a roof looks good to me

207
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:30,320
 He's walking around this house and at one point the real estate agent goes into another room and that is when David

208
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
 Timothy moon makes a decision

209
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,700
 He realizes that one of the rooms in this house that he's looking at buying is a three-year-old girls bedroom

210
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:48,920
 Now the girl's gone. The girl is absent. Nothing bad happens to the girl and David walks into this empty room

211
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,040
 He looks from side to side. He's skulking now. He's skulking through the room

212
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,160
 He's crawling on all fours like the grudge girl

213
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,880
 he zeroes in on

214
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,320
 Something in the corner of the room now I'm gonna say this this room looks like a little kids room

215
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,480
 To make this whole thing even more disturbing. There is giant stuffed animals and like Disney characters and stuff Disney characters

216
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,360
 There's not like animated characters running around. It's not toon town

217
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,920
 But she has all of this stuff

218
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,720
 It looks like a little kids room to make this all even creepier

219
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,960
 But somehow if you walked into someone's room right now, would you be able to tell what their dirty clothes hamper was?

220
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,320
 I couldn't

221
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,200
 Vines on the floor my dirty clothes on the floor, but

222
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,080
 Apparently he was able to walk into this room. He's probably scoping it out the whole time

223
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
 He's probably like hey

224
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
 Can we take another look at this room and the real estate agents like we've been

225
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,480
 Ten times already. He's like yeah, but I think I left my watch in there and he's still wearing his watch

226
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,960
 He's like he's able to zero in on the dirty clothes hamper of this little girl

227
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,480
 He begins and the reason why we know all this stuff

228
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,080
 It's because this was also on video. He begins going through the dirty clothes and

229
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
 he pulls out a

230
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,900
 pair of the this I so disgusting

231
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,640
 He pulls out a pair of the little girls underwear and goes

232
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,920
 He's just sniffing it. He's just in hate

233
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:26,440
 You know how disgusting children are how filthy they are

234
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,840
 They're the ones constantly picking their nose and picking their butts and being super gross and never taking baths and stuff

235
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,280
 I didn't man. It was a struggle to get me to take a bath. I was 12 years old

236
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,880
 I hated taking baths and showers. They're gross dude and this dude is smelling her underwear

237
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,120
 And then he throws him back. He leaves the room and then a couple minutes later

238
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,780
 He's able to ditch the real estate agent again

239
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:59,480
 Run back into the room get another sniff of these disgusting dirt. It's dirty clothes, bro

240
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,600
 It's dirty clothes and he's smelling them and

241
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,960
 Then to just make the thing funny

242
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:16,040
 So gross that's so gross. There's an interview ABC 15 when they're interviewing forensic psychologist John

243
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,200
 Bellatoro was very interesting quote quote this isn't someone who's unsure and needs to look around and try to figure out

244
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,840
 Is this the thing that arouses me? He knows immediately

245
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,560
 Unquote just like the guy in the first story. This isn't someone who is driving on the road and he goes

246
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,840
 You know what? I think I'm gonna do today for the first time ever. I've just had this thought

247
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,720
 I'm gonna kidnap a young boy. This is someone who's thought about this over and over again

248
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,120
 This is someone who has fantasized about this and they knew this was what would turn them on

249
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,420
 With David Timothy moon. It's not alleged. He actually pled guilty to this crime

250
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,920
 We'll get to that in a second, but it's on tape. He's sniffing a little girl's underwear

251
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,000
 Like what is going to say that it's back as it's just on tape the whole thing's disgusting

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,960
 But as an outsider as a non-pervo you look at it and you go why why why any of that?

253
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,920
 Did he pick that house because he knew a little girl lived there?

254
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,520
 Is that how creepy this is or did he just happen to be in a house and see a little girl's room and go?

255
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,480
 I bet you there's a hamper in there like what is the logic behind this?

256
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:26,200
 Outside of just the disgusting part of the fetish. There's so many other pieces now. He said he told the court

257
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,560
 It's the biggest mistake he ever made and they believed it. They believed it

258
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,880
 It was kind of like a one-time thing. It was just like he happened to I mean who hasn't been house shopping and been like

259
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,800
 You know what? I'm missing in life the disgusting smell of used underwear. That's what's been missing in my 50 years of life

260
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,520
 He got charged with all this stuff. He pled guilty to

261
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,940
 Misdemeanor trespassing his sentence. I mean you can argue over what type of this ought to me

262
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,680
 This is reeks of no pun intended this reeks of a sex crime, right?

263
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,080
 No one's like this is my path to fortune and fame smelling underwear

264
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,560
 The only thing that works is like some sort of fetish

265
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,100
 He pleads guilty to misdemeanor trespassing all he gets for this is

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,280
 Unsupervised probation no one's even keeping an eye on him your hamper right now your hamper may be unsafe

267
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 He may be hiding in the shadows right now

268
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,320
 Trying to get a whiff of your clothes unsupervised probation and when he completes this program of not being supervised

269
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,200
 It's not even a program. It was the same thing he was doing before he got arrested

270
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,960
 This can be expunged from his record. No one will ever know he was the panty sniffer of Phoenix, Arizona

271
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,940
 And you could go maybe it is maybe it is just a one-time thing

272
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,240
 Maybe he was just walking through and he happened to fall and trip into the little girl's room

273
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,300
 And then he was getting up he accidentally fell into the hamper and smelled underwear twice maybe

274
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,140
 But also according to the police report when he found out the police were looking for him. He threw his computer away

275
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,680
 So we're

276
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,880
 These three dudes we just had to pay a speeding ticket and now we're sitting with a guy tried kidnapping a little boy

277
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,900
 Allegedly a guy who was banging Elmo allegedly in a man who's blood guilty to sniffing little girls underwear technically

278
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
 I guess he probably pled guilty to entering the room

279
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,740
 Anyways

280
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
 So that is that story I actually

281
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:35,600
 Interactive adventure I questioned that but I was like nobody wants to pick any of those numbers none of those are fun

282
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 But I didn't want to package them all in one

283
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,400
 Story we pay our speeding ticket we get out of there boogers

284
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,020
 Let's hop in that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind all these alleged pervos. We are headed out to the conspiracy theory iceberg

285
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:57,480
 The conspiracy theory iceberg there's a lot of icebergs out there they keep evolving

286
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,040
 I actually have appeared on a conspiracy theory iceberg

287
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,260
 12 inches sent me a video from parallel pipes. They did a breakdown of the conspiracy theory iceberg

288
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,620
 It's one of those videos

289
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,460
 That's about an hour long and they just go over everything

290
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,220
 That rabbit radio is listed on there and he says it's a really cool podcast and I agree with that

291
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,020
 I don't know why I'm listed on the conspiracy theory iceberg. I'm actually down low enough

292
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,620
 I'm next to solar plexus clown gliders, but it's dope

293
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:33,080
 I'm actually become meta the man who started reporting on these conspiracy theory icebergs has now become part of the iceberg itself

294
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,720
 But but with the conspiracy theory iceberg because there's so many of them some are interesting some aren't some are too mysterious

295
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,640
 We'll never know and some are very vague

296
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,800
 There is no

297
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,840
 conspiracy is

298
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,680
 Often found on the lower levels if not the lowest level of the conspiracy theory iceberg and it's something I looked at on and off over the years

299
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,100
 But that's an easy get right you could always say all conspiracy theories are fake that this is all some sort of

300
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,860
 Mind manipulation or like I've said before a lot of conspiracy theories are fake to distract us from real conspiracy theories

301
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,660
 And that's not a new idea a lot of people have said that even before I started saying that I'm not saying I made that up or anything like that

302
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,040
 But it's a real easy one and so when I would see that on the conspiracy theory iceberg

303
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,740
 I would think oh I could do an episode like that, but

304
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,780
 I'm really not saying anything new

305
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
 But a couple weeks ago I

306
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,380
 Got an email from somebody and I think they solved the answer

307
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,500
 -

308
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 There are no conspiracies

309
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,820
 It's very very simple

310
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,380
 belief

311
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,340
 There are no conspiracy theories and this is it and I'm

312
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,260
 Paraphrasing what this person sent me and I'm not gonna reveal this person's name, but this is the theory

313
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,100
 Conspiracy theories are used to pass information from one person to another

314
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,180
 That information we are not privy to

315
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,340
 Conspiracies don't really exist. They're simply coded messages

316
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,340
 Now I've talked about that before

317
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,580
 With certain stories and I've talked about hitting codes being passed back and forth

318
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,960
 But it actually that's just scratching the surface of this one. So for example, let's say I wanted to let's say

319
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,460
 I'm a member of an organization because you'd have to be really powerful to do this

320
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,880
 We're not talking about low-level theories like monkeys don't exist, but it would explain why theories like monkey don't exist

321
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,420
 Doesn't become popular, but birds don't exist do

322
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,620
 Birds don't exist as a very very well-known conspiracy theory

323
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,660
 We covered it on the show a long time ago Carson was the first person to recommend it to me. Thank you very much Carson

324
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,940
 There's flyers in every major city. It's very it's it's a meme

325
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,800
 It's fake. It was set up as a parody of conspiracy theories

326
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,160
 Why is that one more popular than monkeys don't exist?

327
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,000
 Which is which is earnest at the very least that they're both dumb

328
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,600
 But one of them people honestly believe it that monkeys do not exist. It's hilarious

329
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,280
 Right and it makes more sense. I was talking about this on a live stream the other night

330
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,400
 We don't see monkeys in our daily life. You can actually convince someone that monkeys don't exist

331
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,220
 It's a lot harder to convince someone that birds don't exist because we interact with birds all of the time

332
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,580
 Why is birds don't exist more popular than monkeys don't exist?

333
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,460
 Because what's happening is one group of people are trying to spread a message to another group of people

334
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,900
 They're using the conspiracy theories as code and we've talked about this before on the podcast

335
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,620
 But we're gonna go more in-depth now because conspiracy theories blow up very quickly

336
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,840
 They get publicized very quickly the message gets spread very quickly and people are just looking at the surface of it

337
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
 They're not looking for the code

338
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,880
 It's an easy way to spread your message is to actually make it controversial to make it

339
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,360
 Shocking look at that Lil Nas X dude

340
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,020
 He came out with that song called call me by your name

341
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,120
 Montero whatever it is and this video he's like banging Satan and he's like doing a lap dance for Satan

342
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,580
 And then he breaks off Satan horns and becomes Satan and

343
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,060
 Everyone like this song had like millions of downloads and he was selling those shoes and all stuff

344
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,180
 no one would have ever downloaded that song if it was him at a

345
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,740
 Concert if it was just video of him singing to his fans exact same song you make it controversial

346
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,900
 You're gonna get the message out

347
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,160
 Nobody would he would have had the same hundred thousand people who downloaded his last song download this song instead

348
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,460
 He has all of these YouTube videos and these political pundits talking about it

349
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
 It was 100% strategy

350
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,280
 100% strategy behind that so if I want to send a message to you

351
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,080
 I will craft a conspiracy theory called birds don't exist and you know what the message is

352
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,760
 I know what the message is and I also want to take this moment to say a

353
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,320
 Good example of this in Dead Rabbit recommends this

354
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,400
 I don't want to go into detail about it because it's such a good movie

355
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,560
 I don't want to spoil it

356
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,960
 Beyond the Silver Lake or under the Silver Lake. I want to recommend that I should know the name of it

357
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,440
 I'll put it in the show notes. I think it's under the Silver Lake

358
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,960
 It's a movie about this about how conspiracy theories are actually in hidden messages and music and all the stuff that we think is satanic

359
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,620
 Illuminati stuff is actually two groups of people communicating with each other two powerful groups of people communicating with each other

360
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,200
 It's a brilliant movie. It's a great movie. I recommend checking it out

361
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,220
 But for what we're talking about here, let's get back to this core thing

362
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,700
 There is no conspiracy theory conspiracy theories are just ways of people to pass messages back and forth. That's still super vague

363
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,560
 right

364
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,360
 Like it's easy. It'd be easy for me to make that statement and then be like, okay, that's the end of the episode

365
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,560
 I got an email from somebody who actually not only can specify what the message is

366
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,240
 but he

367
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
 made good on it

368
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,680
 Boogers let's hop back in that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind the conspiracy theory iceberg. We're headed out

369
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,240
 To the New York Stock Exchange

370
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,900
 Carbonicopter lands in the middle of stock exchange everyone has to stop trading for the day economic disaster

371
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:14,460
 But we're here and the reason why we're here is this is the theory if you take a conspiracy theory

372
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,580
 Like the great reset which we talked about yesterday and you strip it of

373
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:27,440
 All of the satanic stuff of all of the Illuminati stuff you boil it down to its essence

374
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,340
 its stock tips

375
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,480
 when they start talking about ways to

376
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,800
 We're gonna invent this microchip and we're gonna put it in your hand and all that stuff when that's the conspiracy theory

377
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,880
 invest in biometric technology

378
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,220
 when you can find a conspiracy theory and

379
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,600
 boil it down to

380
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,160
 How the private market would benefit from that?

381
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,540
 That tells you who to invest in

382
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,180
 Think about it this way monkeys aren't real the conspiracy theory is

383
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:09,940
 NASA is trying to prove that God doesn't exist that evolution is real and monkeys are a part of evolution

384
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,940
 So they're faking it. They're faking all of it

385
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:20,500
 Technically, I guess you can you can invest money in NASA birds aren't real is all about how birds are actually spy technology

386
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,380
 They're like drones. They're sent out to

387
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,740
 Investigate us and they're all fake their robots

388
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,600
 You would then when that conspiracy theory started

389
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,000
 You would go okay, let's start moving investments towards unmanned aerial vehicles

390
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,840
 Let's start putting some of our investments in drone technology and surveillance technology

391
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,400
 Who's the hot camera maker right now?

392
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,840
 Who's making the best optical cameras for these drones invest in them?

393
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,440
 the theory is is that conspiracy theories like birds aren't real was a way for

394
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:56,900
 people to spread stock tips to commit insider trading that they're all fake

395
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,560
 When you look at stuff about microchips being implanted

396
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,620
 invest in the biometrics when you start looking at stuff about the

397
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,580
 Singularity and the singularity is going to take stuff up start investing in companies that are trying to do AI

398
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,380
 One organization is looking at the stuff and they know that they're going to have a huge product come out

399
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,980
 They see that they're going to have their stock is going to blow up

400
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,420
 They know something's going on to alert their fellow conspirators

401
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,500
 They craft a conspiracy theory that's based on what they know is going to happen

402
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,260
 And it's not that they know that the great reset is going to happen the great reset

403
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,580
 The reason why that's more popular than other conspiracy theories in this theory is

404
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:44,460
 It's being pushed because they're trying to get other people to invest in the products that prop up the quote-unquote great reset

405
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,460
 It's fake. It doesn't exist

406
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,300
 But you will eat bugs is a thing that people are constantly saying when they talk about great reset

407
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,980
 The whole thing in this theory the whole thing was set up. So you would start investing in companies that

408
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,460
 Grow bugs now you go Jason

409
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,940
 Maybe that's the horse leading the cart or the cart leading the horse if the great reset is coming

410
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,180
 They're gonna force everyone to eat but I can't believe I'm still talking about the stupid great reset

411
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,540
 But the great reset is coming. They're gonna force everyone to eat bugs. Of course you should invest in bugs

412
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,500
 But the great reset is something it's so hypothetical. They're not saying it's gonna happen tomorrow

413
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:25,140
 But according to this theory if you invest in bugs now if you invest in bug farms now

414
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,340
 You're gonna start making money now. In fact the person who sent me this story

415
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,180
 Claims to have made hundreds of thousands of dollars

416
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,820
 By simply following the biggest conspiracy theories out there stripping them of the satanic and the Illuminati nonsense

417
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:48,340
 Investing in the core technologies talked about in those conspiracy theories no matter how outlandish the conspiracy theory is

418
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,820
 Even if it's something that's not supposed to take place until the future not supposed to take place for a while something like transhumanism

419
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,540
 You boil it down to stuff you can invest in this person has claimed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars

420
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,340
 This isn't and they were trying to get me to invest in them. I've talked to this person a lot

421
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,140
 Way before this we were actually interacting they listened to the show

422
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,900
 They're a fan of the show and they approached me one day and said hey

423
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,380
 Do you know of any new big conspiracy theories that are coming up and I said no not really and they said well

424
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,060
 This is why I'm asking because here's my theory and I've actually taken this theory over the past couple months and made a lot of money

425
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:30,900
 So if you could figure out what the next big conspiracy theories are going to be it can give people tips on how to become rich

426
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:39,280
 Is that the reason and this has been a question that I've talked about a lot on the show why some conspiracy theories are more popular than others

427
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,580
 Is it because some conspiracy theories are artificially propped up not because of you know Russian disinformation

428
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,820
 Trying to prop up flat earth to make Americans look stupid. That's a popular conspiracy theory out there

429
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,980
 Not because it's they're building up these fake conspiracy theories to blind us from the truth the reason why

430
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:04,220
 Trees are mountains or mountains are trees and trees are bushes. However that one was set up or monkeys don't exist because those are

431
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:13,100
 Organic conspiracy theories those are actually thought up by individuals. It's just an interesting piece of this puzzle

432
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:19,220
 Because that is always a question. Why is flat earth more popular than

433
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,300
 So many other conspiracy theories. It's dumb. It's observably dumb

434
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:31,940
 YouTube promotes it YouTube lets the algorithm run with this flat earth stuff. Why is someone benefiting from it?

435
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,460
 Is it as simple as when you see the flat earth stuff come up?

436
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,540
 It was to promote GPS technology when you can boil down these suit

437
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,100
 It doesn't work with every conspiracy theory doesn't work with the obscure ones

438
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:54,040
 But when you can boil down these popular conspiracy theories that everyone knows about and find out how the private sector would benefit from

439
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,900
 Technologies in that conspiracy theory you can make money apparently

440
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,300
 You can make a lot of money

441
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,020
 Now again, you could argue if you if people are talking about putting biometrics inside of you and

442
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,580
 That's being talked about in the news and you invest in those companies

443
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,220
 It's because they plan on putting biometrics inside of you

444
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,740
 They've been talking about putting biometrics inside of you since 1992

445
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,940
 I've been hearing about the microchips under the skin since 1992 and you could go well

446
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,980
 They're doing it in Sweden. They're doing it at this nightclub in Sweden. Da da da da

447
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,820
 They have never ever been able to fully implement a microchip under the skin

448
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,980
 They've been talking about this almost my entire life

449
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:40,420
 But companies have been making these things and I you may be able to take a look at

450
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,540
 When those conspiracy theories started when those conspiracy theories start to dip and they're not as popular and then they peak again in popularity

451
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:53,900
 And look at the profits look at the stock increases of those companies

452
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,380
 it's not that people

453
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,020
 legitimate stock investors are

454
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,900
 Reading godlike productions and they're super scared that everyone's going to get a microchip

455
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,460
 It's not that the conspiracy theory makes people worried and they're investing in it or makes them hopeful

456
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,780
 And they want everyone to get microchip and they're investing in microchips. It's that the conspiracy theory is false

457
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:23,300
 It's 100% fake and it's a way to tell your friends what you are investing in and what you should invest in

458
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:30,140
 Without ever getting caught for insider trading without it ever being tracked back to you and the conspiracy theory just lives on

459
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:37,540
 It would explain why some conspiracy theories are more popular and longer lasting than others

460
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,580
 All these conspiracy theories we investigate and we're trying to solve these mysteries

461
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,180
 could be just

462
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,220
 Wrapping paper

463
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,260
 Around a gift that the rich people are giving each other

464
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,140
 We never get to

465
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,500
 Until you crack the code and start investing as well

466
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,100
 So the next time you see a conspiracy theory pop up and you start to see it gain popularity

467
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,880
 And you have a little money to throw around

468
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,300
 Maybe you should try this too

469
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:18,660
 Boil it down to its essence. What are the technologies needed to make this conspiracy theory work?

470
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,420
 And see if it actually could be insider trading

471
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:31,700
 However the flip side could be that it's not that it actually is

472
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:40,540
 Investors knowing the conspiracy theory is true and they're trying to make as much money as they can

473
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,020
 Before the world ends

474
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,780
 You could be investing in a microchip company

475
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,740
 And making some short-term gains because you thought it was just a code

476
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:02,100
 But when that microchip is being forced into your head against your will and you cry one final teardrop

477
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,660
 Before your emotions are completely overwritten

478
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:13,260
 You will remember that your investment helped in the future of mankind

479
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,380
