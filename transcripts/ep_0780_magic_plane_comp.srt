1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 The trial of Alex Jones comes to a shocking and bizarre ending.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,000
 Is El Salvador currently building a supervillain's headquarters?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,600
 And then we travel to Whalen, Massachusetts to meet a man who watched a plane turn into a demon today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,100
 [Music]

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,900
 Hope you guys are having a great day too guys. We have so much to cover this episode.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,600
 We got to get started right away first off coming in from yesterday's episode

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,000
 because he didn't get to fly the Carpenter copter. You're back.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm so proud of the mispronounced your name. It's Luis.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Everyone give a round of applause for Luis Lopez coming back in as Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
 Luis, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,500
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,800
 And a quick reminder, this Thanksgiving November 25th at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Dead Rabbit Radio YouTube channel.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,200
 There will be a live Thanksgiving Dead Rabbit Radio special.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,900
 So come join us on the YouTube channel at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,300
 We're gonna talk. We're gonna play games.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,700
 Maybe, I don't know. Maybe we'll play Ice Spy.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
 I don't know. I don't know what really you can do, but we'll talk.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,800
 And you can ask me questions and we'll probably answer them. Right?

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,000
 That's usually what we do. And here's a new thing I got going.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,500
 While Luis is firing up that Jason Jalopy to take us out. He doesn't get to hear this part.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,600
 You've already been in too many episodes. Guys, have you ever wanted to be on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio?

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,500
 Well, now you can. I've been wanting to do this for a while.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,800
 I'm bringing back the Dead Rabbit Radio bonus episodes.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,300
 Because I know a lot of you guys have been wanting those.

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,100
 We're bringing those back. The next time I go on break, we're gonna have at least five bonus episodes.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,800
 Maybe a whole ten bonus episodes. But I'm gonna bring them back.

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,300
 And if you've ever wanted to be on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, now is your chance.

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,800
 What I need. A long time ago, I did an episode called Earth First.

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,100
 And there's a little audio drama at the beginning of that where I'm delivering a speech to all of my followers.

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,500
 And we're talking about attacking Mars.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,800
 And when I say all of my followers, it was me yelling out Earth First in my apartment.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
 Walking around and getting all these different angles to make it sound like a room full of people.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,000
 But guys, now I want you to be that room full of people.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,700
 When I make a bonus episode of that one, we are gonna remaster it.

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,000
 So what I want you to do, you have until January 1st to turn this in.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
 January 1st at midnight. Otherwise, that'd become a pumpkin.

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,100
 You don't turn it in. I need you to record yourself chanting Earth First.

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,900
 Earth First. And I want to have all your voices.

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,100
 I want to have this soundscape of all you guys also chanting this along.

43
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,700
 So guys, I'm not too worried about mic quality.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,000
 So if you're doing it on your phone, it's all gonna be mixed in.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,600
 I just want this chorus of the fluffle.

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,400
 Earth First. Earth First. And I need you to email me that.

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 If you're gonna do it, the best way is through email so I can keep it all sorted.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,600
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com.

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,000
 Send me the clip of you chanting Earth First.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
 I'll put the episode in the show notes so you can listen to it to get psyched up.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
 You got until January 1st to send it over.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,300
 That will be awesome.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,800
 And then when I release that bonus episode, we'll have that remastered intro.

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,900
 So I, dude, I would love it if you guys did this.

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,100
 And if you guys want to be on DeadRabber Radio, there's no...

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,200
 You don't have to pay me any money. You don't have to join the Patreon.

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
 There's nothing special.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,700
 I will need you to agree that I'm allowed to use your voice.

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,200
 So when you send it to me, if you send something over saying,

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,500
 "I allow my voice to be used on the podcast in perpetuity through the rest of the universe."

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,400
 And if you don't, then I'll send you an email.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,800
 That's the only thing I'll need from you.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,400
 So, you know, 10 years from now, I don't get sued by a thousand people.

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 But if you want to be on an episode of DeadRabber Radio and you're not planning on suing me,

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,800
 send me your vo- Dude, wouldn't that be cool to really have that soundscape?

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
 'Cause, yeah, that would be awesome.

68
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,900
 And I'll keep reminding you guys once a week until January 1st.

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,600
 Let's get that done, dude.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,500
 That would be dope.

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,300
 Now, Luis got the carboner keys like, "What were you guys talking about?"

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, we get to be on an episode of DeadRabber Radio."

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
 Luis is like, "What? What did I miss?"

74
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,800
 "Ah, nothing. Did you get the car working?"

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 "Awesome. Let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy, Luis.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,900
 We are leaving behind DeadRabber Command.

77
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,400
 We are driving all the way out to Connecticut."

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,100
 It's a nice leisurely drive across the nation.

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,400
 We're headed out to Connecticut because this is big news for the conspiracy theory community.

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,400
 Alex Jones just lost his Sandy Hook case.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
 Or did he?

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,600
 It's really, really interesting.

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
 I think it's interesting for conspiracy theorists.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
 I think it's interesting legal precedent.

85
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,600
 Yeah, so what happened was,

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
 this is it in a nutshell.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,000
 This is it in a nutshell where YouTube doesn't yank my channel.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,200
 This is as safe as I can navigate these waters.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,800
 Sandy Hook was the awful school shooting done by that idiot Adam Lanza.

90
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 He walked into elementary school, shot a bunch of kids.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,600
 And there's a conspiracy theory that it never happened.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
 That's such a bizarre conspiracy theory.

93
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,500
 I understand stuff like 9/11 was an inside job.

94
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,100
 9/11 was not done by Al Cata, but by the government or these other groups like Massad or whatever.

95
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,500
 But some people, there is a small group of people who say 9/11 never happened.

96
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 That the Twin Towers never existed in the first place.

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,900
 It's rare, but I've seen that conspiracy theory online.

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,000
 The Sandy Hook never happened conspiracy theory actually got really popular.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
 Right? It was all fake.

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,000
 That the school was made up of fake children.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,800
 It was like a, because Newton, what is in Newtown, Connecticut is where it was at.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,200
 That the school itself was like a CIA mirage.

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,300
 Basically, if you're really thirsty, you wanted some cafeteria food and you're walking through Newtown, Connecticut, it would magically appear.

104
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,800
 They said like all the teachers there were CIA agents.

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
 The students never existed.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
 It was that.

107
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,400
 It was very, very interesting choice to take for your conspiracy theories.

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,300
 And when you study conspiracy theories, you're constantly seeing these things vie for power.

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
 And that was the one that became the most popular.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,100
 Not that it was an inside job, not that it was a, what's the, a false flag.

111
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,800
 Right? It was that it didn't happen in the first place.

112
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,900
 And people started showing up at relatives' houses, survivors' houses and questioning them about the kids and all that stuff.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,000
 You don't, your kids aren't real.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Your kids aren't real.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,900
 And so Alex Jones went with that one.

116
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,700
 And he got sued for it.

117
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,300
 He got sued by the families of the victims of Newtown, of the shooting.

118
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,700
 He got sued.

119
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,100
 And he got sued in Texas and he got sued in Connecticut.

120
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,200
 They were alleging that he was profiting off a lie.

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,300
 And he was encouraging people to harass them.

122
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,000
 It was like this class action suit.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
 That he knew it wasn't real.

124
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,800
 So you can't take the, if you report something that's false, but you believe it's real, you were tricked.

125
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,900
 I think, I don't think there's a court precedent for being a dummy.

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:40,300
 But they believe he knew it, he knew it was fake and he was still profiting off of it.

127
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,600
 And it's interesting because Alex Jones said, listen, I did at first report on it.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,700
 And I was just doing my due diligence report on some lunatics, say, all the time.

129
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,600
 But I did realize that it wasn't fake and actually apologized for spreading those rumors and stuff like that.

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,500
 So let bygones be bygones.

131
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,900
 And this is where, this case, I keep saying it ended November 15th, it never went to trial.

132
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:13,400
 The judge found without a jury trial, without a judge trial, Alex Jones was found guilty.

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
 And this is what makes it super weird.

134
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,700
 Because I do not agree with Alex Jones's, even if it was a previous one that it never happened.

135
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,400
 I don't believe that it never happened.

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
 Something happened.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,300
 But what Alex, and I had said this before.

138
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,100
 I've said this so many times on this podcast and I said that specifically about Alex Jones

139
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,600
 and just conspiracy theorist content creators in general.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
 Like, because this almost happened to this show.

141
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,100
 When I was first starting the show off, we were maybe 50, 60, 100 episodes in whatever it was.

142
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,700
 I did an episode about Kevin Spacey's creepy Christmas greeting.

143
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,200
 And it was one of my most downloaded episodes at the time.

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
 It was huge.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,700
 And I thought, oh, this is interesting.

146
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,000
 If I was an idiot and I didn't know what type of brand I wanted to project with this podcast,

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,900
 I would chase that.

148
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
 My next episode would have been more about Kevin Spacey and the Illuminati Elite.

149
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,940
 And then maybe a couple episodes about people pooping,

150
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,000
 mephatics, whatever I talk about normally.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,300
 And then I do another one like that.

152
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,900
 And then eventually the podcast would just become me seriously believing all of this stuff

153
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,300
 that I usually just kind of poo poo, no pun intended.

154
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,500
 And I've noticed that like when I did the episode of the Adrenochrome Witch,

155
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 written by Peter DeCombes, this great episode, and actually write the book,

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
 huge, huge spike in hits.

157
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,400
 Whenever I talk about Adrenochrome, huge spike in hits.

158
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 But I don't want to talk about Adrenochrome all the time.

159
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
 I don't want to talk about Pizzagate stuff all the time.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,000
 I find it pretty boring actually to just be repeating the same story over and over in the variations.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,400
 So I just in the next episode, I talked about the Wisconsin Death Cave

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,200
 or just something else that I found really fascinating.

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,300
 But I knew that that is not the norm because I've seen some of my favorite podcasters do an episode.

164
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,000
 I see this with YouTubers that I enjoy too.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,100
 They do an episode and it spikes in the algorithm.

166
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
 You can actually see how many views it's getting.

167
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,100
 And then they start doing just that content.

168
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,300
 And then I just unsubscribe because that's not what I was there for.

169
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
 But they're getting a bunch of whole new listeners,

170
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,900
 but all they're doing is the same thing over and over again.

171
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,000
 And I've mentioned that before and I said specifically I go,

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
 I can tell you what happened with Alex Jones.

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,400
 He started saying that nonsense and it spiked because it was as popular as conspiracy theory.

174
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,700
 No one else was really talking about.

175
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,000
 And then he kept doubling down and getting more and more listeners.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,600
 And I predicted that and that's why he lost the lawsuit.

177
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,000
 What happened was the plaintiff in the case, the families of the victims,

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,600
 they said, "We want to see your algorithm.

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,800
 We want to see behind the scenes of how much money you were making before the conspiracy theory."

180
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
 This is part of our discovery.

181
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
 And then we want to see how much money you were making and how many hits you were getting

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,600
 on the episodes you talked about Sandy Hook being fake.

183
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
 That's what we want to see.

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,100
 Give us those books.

185
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,400
 And he was ordered to return over this information.

186
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,900
 And apparently this is on the plaintiff's side for two years he was dragging his feet.

187
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
 He was not releasing that information.

188
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,600
 And the judge finally, she goes, "You know what?

189
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,100
 No, it's been two years.

190
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,800
 We can't even move ahead with this trial.

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
 You're obstructing this.

192
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,200
 You lose by default.

193
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,500
 There will be no trial to tell whether or not you're guilty of spreading misinformation

194
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,600
 and having these families harassed.

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
 That part's done, Alex.

196
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 Now we're going straight to damages.

197
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,500
 And apparently they did the same thing in the Texas courthouse.

198
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,100
 So now he's already lost the lawsuit.

199
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,400
 And now it's a matter of how much he's going to have to pay these families.

200
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
 And I knew it.

201
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,200
 I was saying that before.

202
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,700
 I go, "Alex Jones, he got caught up in those trends.

203
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
 And I knew it.

204
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,600
 I knew Alex Jones got caught up in those trends.

205
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
 They knew it too.

206
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,700
 And they wanted to see those numbers.

207
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
 But he never turned it over.

208
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,800
 Now, in Alex Jones' defense, I did go and watch his rebuttal video.

209
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,100
 And he said, "Fake news.

210
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,000
 This is the media trying to smear me.

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,100
 The only reason I'm getting sued is because I helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton and her

212
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,000
 machine came after me.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,100
 And that's why I'm getting sued in the first place."

214
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,400
 He goes on to state that, "This is an attack on the judicial system.

215
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
 I didn't even get a trial."

216
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,100
 And to answer the allegations about what the plaintiffs are saying, he goes, "I turned

217
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
 over everything is what I did.

218
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,500
 I didn't give them the specific time period they were asking for.

219
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,700
 I just turned over all my books, all my Excel spreadsheets.

220
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,900
 And that wasn't good enough for him.

221
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
 Who knows?"

222
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
 Right.

223
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
 I'm not there.

224
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,800
 I'm not Alex Jones or the plaintiff's families.

225
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,900
 But, parent, whatever it was, it wasn't good enough for the judge to allow it.

226
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,700
 Now, Alex Jones has racked up quite the enemy list.

227
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,400
 I agree with him on that and did, was there some political pressure to get these charges

228
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 started in the first place?

229
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
 Maybe.

230
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
 Right?

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 Maybe.

232
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,800
 But at the same time, he was saying something that he says he believed for a short time

233
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,300
 and then stopped believing and then just stopped bringing it up.

234
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
 But I don't, I actually think he never believed in it.

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,600
 I think he ran with it.

236
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
 He said it the first time because he thought it was popular and it took off.

237
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
 I don't think he ever sincerely thought that it was all fake.

238
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,300
 But now he's going to end up owing a ton of money.

239
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,900
 He then compares this, him losing this lawsuit to the Roe baby still being alive.

240
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 And I go, "What?

241
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,000
 I didn't, what?"

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,200
 And I looked that up and that took me down a total evil rabbit hole.

243
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,800
 Apparently, you know, the Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court abortion battle?

244
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,900
 Roe had the baby.

245
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
 I didn't know that.

246
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
 Apparently.

247
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,300
 It's not a deep secret.

248
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,400
 I guess when the trial was going on, the judges and the lawyers were like, "This is going

249
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,800
 to take longer than you're pregnant.

250
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,000
 Like, that's just what you're going to have this baby."

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,400
 And so she had the baby and it was given up for adoption and she's like still alive.

252
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
 She's like a 67 year old woman now.

253
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,500
 And I was like, "That's a cool like piece of American history.

254
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 But you're not the Roe baby, bro.

255
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 You're not the Roe baby.

256
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,900
 The Roe baby is just, it's a bizarre fact."

257
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,700
 You were saying that the shooting never existed and I don't believe you thought it was true.

258
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
 You were chasing the links.

259
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,200
 This is what I think and they caught you.

260
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,400
 And that I do believe are 100% Alex Jones would still be around and he would still be

261
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,340
 the powerhouse he was.

262
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,900
 Had he not pursued, I 100% believe that.

263
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,800
 Hillary Clinton, they hated him.

264
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
 They've hated Alex Jones for a long time and they were never able to shut him down.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,800
 It wasn't until he gave him enough ammo to do it that he took him out.

266
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,900
 He's even saying a bunch of stuff for years from 2001.

267
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,200
 He was under the skin of Bush.

268
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,600
 He was under the skin of Obama and they couldn't stop him.

269
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,400
 But as a conspiracy theory content creator myself, there are difficult waters to navigate.

270
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,000
 I put out episodes and I thought, "Well, this is the last episode of Dead Red Radio.

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,300
 Either someone's going to physically come after me or YouTube's going to shut me down

272
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,900
 or Spotify's going to shut me down and stuff like that."

273
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,100
 So there is always that peril.

274
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,600
 But I really think that he, that was a bridge too far.

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,700
 So Alex, you're probably going to have to pay a bunch of money to these families.

276
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,600
 So I think the moral of the story is don't chase the clicks.

277
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,000
 I mean, the moral might not apply to you or 99% of humanity.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
 But don't chase the clicks.

279
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,200
 You have an idea of what content you want to put out and you keep putting that content out

280
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,800
 and it'll have an audience or it won't have an audience.

281
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,900
 Eventually you're going to start running out of that stuff.

282
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,600
 Eventually you're just going to start repeating yourself and then you're going to be looking for things

283
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,100
 that may not be true.

284
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,800
 But you know that your audience will enjoy it.

285
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,100
 So you start doing that stuff and then eventually you become real raw news or info wars.

286
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,600
 Right?

287
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,300
 So that's the moral of that story, Alex.

288
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,400
 You chase the clicks and it's just not, it sucks because I think he really does have a passion

289
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,100
 for conspiracy theory content.

290
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,600
 I think old Alex Jones was a pretty decent dude back in the day.

291
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,500
 But then I think the show just got so successful that it became a parody of itself.

292
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,700
 If you listen to old Alex Jones stuff, it's the weirdo on the street corner like blaring out the truth

293
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,300
 with the megaphone like he was always pictured and then it just became super corporate

294
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,700
 and it became all about the dollar.

295
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,400
 Like what stories are going to generate the most hits?

296
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 Let's cover those.

297
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,700
 And one of those stories got the channels taken down.

298
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,400
 He's gone, right?

299
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,000
 From YouTube.

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,500
 You have to find him.

301
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,900
 So yeah, it is a cautionary tale for conspiracy theory content creators.

302
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,300
 But again, don't chase the clicks.

303
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,200
 That went on a little bit longer than I expected, but we still got a lot of stuff to cover.

304
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:56,400
 So, Luis, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the just in case we don't get to the third story.

305
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,300
 I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the carboner copter.

306
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,900
 We are leaving behind this courthouse in Connecticut.

307
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,100
 We are we are headed all the way out to El Salvador.

308
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:21,400
 El Salvador, the land of beauty, the land of hopes and dreams, lush jungles, water, water, right?

309
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,900
 I'm sure there's rivers, maybe a lake in the country of El Salvador and but all that stuff.

310
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
 Just go away, nature.

311
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,100
 Get out of our way.

312
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:37,000
 We were dropping into our driving big bulldozers like we're bad guys in fern goalie because we're here to build a paradise.

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,800
 What you call you thought all this nature was paradise boo.

314
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
 And we got on our hard hats.

315
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,300
 We eat, eat, eat tractors are backing up and like girders are flying through the air.

316
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's not a super safe workplace.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,100
 Don't tell OSHA.

318
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,200
 We're like bouncing on the beams.

319
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,800
 We as it's spinning around.

320
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,300
 The real reason why we're not here to become a bunch of acrobats.

321
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,400
 The real reason why here is president Naib Bukli.

322
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,600
 Naib Bukli, president of El Salvador is celebrating Bitcoin week.

323
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,900
 So everyone's like, everyone's like cheering.

324
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,700
 He's walking on stage with a little microphone.

325
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
 He's like, hey, bitcoins are awesome.

326
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,600
 Right.

327
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,300
 And everyone's like, yeah, yeah.

328
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,300
 And he's really hyping up the Bitcoin because he's come up with a plan and it's pretty ingenious.

329
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:32,200
 Actually, they are going to turn Bitcoin into a legal tender within the country of El Salvador.

330
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,700
 And he has this vision of the future.

331
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,400
 He wants El Salvador to become on par with Singapore.

332
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 So it's going to be like just this international destination of these movers and these shakers.

333
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,800
 And they'll be like bad guys with like patches on their eyes and like every third person will be an undercover CIA agent.

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,000
 Crotty chopping dudes in the neck.

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,300
 He wants to turn it into a James Bond movie, but he wants to turn it into an international place to travel.

336
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,200
 And he wants to attract Bitcoin.

337
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
 He's going to make it so you can go anywhere in the country and buy stuff with Bitcoin.

338
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,500
 If you sign up with a national wallet in El Salvador, if you're a citizen there, you can get $30 in Bitcoin.

339
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,400
 Just deposit it right away.

340
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,500
 And if you are not a citizen of El Salvador, if you invest three bitcoins

341
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,300
 into El Salvador's economy, you will get citizenship.

342
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,900
 And I think right now that's like three bitcoins right now is like 80,000.

343
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,200
 Something like that $60,000.

344
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,100
 So that's not bad, right?

345
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,200
 If I had $60,000, I'd become a citizen of El Salvador.

346
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,100
 That'd be dope, dude.

347
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,300
 Like people would ask me where I was from would be like El Salvador.

348
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 I don't know what else you would do with being a citizen of El Salvador if you weren't living there.

349
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,800
 I could go visit, right?

350
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,200
 And so he's pushing this.

351
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,700
 He's pushing this plan so they're really celebrating the Bitcoin and he wants to get a billion dollar bond.

352
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,500
 He's trying to get these investors to buy a billion dollar El Salvador and bond back by the US dollar.

353
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,900
 But he's going to take this money because that's their other legal currency.

354
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,800
 He's going to take this money.

355
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:14,700
 He's going to take 500 million of this one billion and buy 500 million dollars worth of Bitcoin and sit on it.

356
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:22,800
 Because the idea is we're going to buy a bunch of Bitcoin and it's going to make the Bitcoin more valuable because you won't be able to get it easy.

357
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,400
 We're going to buy it.

358
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,700
 We're going to not use it at all for five years.

359
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,100
 We're just going to lock up this huge amount of Bitcoin.

360
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,500
 So people who want Bitcoin will now have to buy Bitcoin or mine more Bitcoin will cause the price to go up.

361
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,400
 The other 500 million dollars.

362
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,100
 I don't know if that plan would work.

363
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,500
 I know there's a lot of very smart financial people who listen to this podcast.

364
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,400
 So you can tell me whether or not that plan works and you can also go earth first and send me in that audio clip.

365
00:20:50,400 --> 00:21:02,200
 But the other 500 million dollars is going to build what can only be described as Dr. Evil's headquarters.

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,600
 He wants to build Bitcoin City.

367
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,900
 It is called the city will be called Bitcoin City.

368
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,200
 It's going to be at the Gulf of Fonesca.

369
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,100
 So that's where we're standing at right now.

370
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,600
 And he envisions this massive metropolis rising up out of this coastline.

371
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:32,200
 Residential commercial buildings, a true glimmering, sparkling state of the art metropolis in El Salvador.

372
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,900
 It's going to have its own airport.

373
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,600
 It's going to have mass transit.

374
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,300
 Everything you could want in a city.

375
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:44,000
 This city, though, is basically built to be a joke from the venture brothers.

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,900
 It's going to be in the tell me which one's more supervillainy.

377
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,600
 Tell me which one of these ideas makes it more seem like a supervillain thing.

378
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,100
 First thing, this is true.

379
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:03,000
 The city is going to be built in a shape of a giant circle and the city planners are going to lay it out.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,900
 So the center of the city is going to be the Bitcoin logo.

381
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,500
 So he's making a city in the shape of a Bitcoin and it looks like a Bitcoin.

382
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,900
 So as you're flying a plane overhead, landing into their airport,

383
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,500
 it'll be like you're seeing a giant Bitcoin there.

384
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,000
 That's what code that's something over commander would do.

385
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,900
 Right.

386
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,000
 I'm going to turn this island into a Cobra logo.

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
 There's no reason, no tactical reason for it.

388
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,200
 It's just something I want to do.

389
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 They're going to have the city.

390
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
 I don't know of any other city.

391
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,600
 I don't know of any other city that's been based on an image like that.

392
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700
 And then that's that's kind of supervillainy.

393
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,700
 But then also Bitcoin city is going to be built near a volcano.

394
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,100
 Right.

395
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's built near a volcano and they're going to build a giant geothermal energy plant.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,100
 So they can mine bitcoins super efficiently.

397
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,300
 So the entire city is per it'll it's here's the thing.

398
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,400
 I love this story and as the number one science podcast of El Salvador,

399
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 I lend my scientific credibility to this project.

400
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,200
 This is what we this is something straight out of a science fiction novel.

401
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,300
 A city built like a coin based on that coin.

402
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,000
 It's local economy will be mining that coin.

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
 Get out of here, Cole.

404
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,600
 Gold go back into the depths of the earth.

405
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,000
 We're mining Bitcoin now.

406
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,200
 And that's fascinating.

407
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,600
 Like it's possible that this city becomes like an Olympic village.

408
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,900
 Like it's built and it's kind of cool.

409
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 And then five years later, it's completely overrun by rats and disease.

410
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:54,900
 Or it could be the first city like we had gold mine towns open up all over Western United States.

411
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,600
 Well, those are also now goes towns that overran by rats and disease.

412
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,000
 But they took longer.

413
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,900
 Took longer.

414
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,800
 What if this becomes the blueprint?

415
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 Not the stupid city looking like the Bitcoin, not that part.

416
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,700
 But what if you do start to see cities start to move towards big points of GMO geothermal activity?

417
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,700
 So they can mine it because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine if you're doing a ton of it.

418
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
 So industrial Bitcoin mining.

419
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,300
 Like I know they have those warehouses full of servers in Russian stuff like that.

420
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,700
 But they don't have a volcano.

421
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,400
 Fascinating.

422
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,500
 We may see cities start to pop up all over the world near these vents.

423
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,800
 Yellowstone just they're like, get out of here.

424
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 Get out of here, tourists.

425
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,500
 And they're just bringing in all these giant pieces of equipment.

426
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,100
 You're like, you do really bad.

427
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,300
 You have to work at Old Faithful.

428
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,400
 You're like, oh, I can't get any work done.

429
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,800
 I can only work every 44 minutes or ever long that thinks to go up.

430
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,700
 The point is, is like this could be a brand new economy.

431
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,200
 And I as the number one science podcast in El Salvador, Dead Rabbit Radio and Jason Carpenter

432
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,700
 fully supports this effort by President Naib Bukli.

433
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
 So that's dope.

434
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
 And it's a vision of the future.

435
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,900
 And I wish him the best.

436
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:12,000
 And maybe someday I will be drinking a shabernet in the center of Bitcoin City with President Naib Bukli.

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
 He's like, dude, at least pronounce my name right, man.

438
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,700
 You're going to give me a bunch of props for this plan.

439
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 The least you could have done is looked up how to pronounce my name and I go, dude, it's the thought that counts.

440
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,400
 It is the and I as the number one science podcast in El Salvador, what I say goes and my cards take him away.

441
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
 And he's like, no, no.

442
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,100
 And then I sit in a throne made out of Bitcoins.

443
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,300
 So I'm just kind of hovering in midair and I'm take over the volcano.

444
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,800
 So yeah, that would be awesome.

445
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,500
 My plans of world domination start in El Salvador.

446
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,800
 Great, great story.

447
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,300
 Wish you guys the best of luck.

448
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,300
 And now that we're in the carbonar copter, we're going to have time for this last story, I think.

449
00:25:50,300 --> 00:26:01,300
 So, Luis, let's go ahead and leave behind my new volcano fortress in the Gulf of Fonseca.

450
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,600
 We are leaving behind my new proxy headquarters.

451
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,400
 We are headed all the way out to Wayland, Massachusetts.

452
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,500
 (Masked voice)

453
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,000
 I found the story online the other day.

454
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,900
 I talk a lot about organized insanity when someone is making claims that you don't agree with them,

455
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,500
 but at least they can can put them forward in a way that kind of makes sense.

456
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 There's a narrative thrust to it.

457
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
 We use that term a lot with Max Kramer.

458
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,900
 He's the homeless man who wants to steal your skin and attack your children.

459
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,800
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

460
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:43,000
 And although you don't agree with his ultimate goal, you understand why he thinks that's okay.

461
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,900
 And that's someone who's organized insanity.

462
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,000
 You don't agree with it, but it makes sense.

463
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,600
 This is an interesting, this fellow that I came across the other day online is kind of has a foot in both worlds.

464
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,900
 But I would put this more into an unorganized insanity.

465
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,000
 Let's go ahead and take a look at this.

466
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,600
 This is submitted by someone, I'm assuming this is their real name, but it's also their username.

467
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,300
 Benjamin Walker, 22, is his name online.

468
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,000
 And this story comes from Wayland, Massachusetts.

469
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So Benjamin says him and his buddies Brian and Antonio were laying out on the ground,

470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,200
 laying out on the grassy park next to the Wayland Library in Wayland, Massachusetts.

471
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,000
 And he says, we're sitting there and then all of a sudden I quote,

472
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,300
 smell to smell that wasn't a cigarette.

473
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,200
 And that's really your first into, I mean, there's literally a billion smells.

474
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,900
 I would argue there's countless smells that aren't a cigarette.

475
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,800
 Dying stars, rotting intestines, ripe cherries.

476
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
 I mean, that's just three, right?

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 The list goes on and on.

478
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,100
 He smells a smell that's not a cigarette.

479
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:08,400
 And then he looks up in the sky and he sees a big black jet plane flying overhead.

480
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
 Now it's close enough to the ground that he sees on the side of it.

481
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,400
 It says meta and the Facebook logo is emblazoned next to the word meta.

482
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,800
 So this is Facebook's big black jet apparently.

483
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,100
 All of a sudden as this plane is flying overhead and he's sitting there with his buddies,

484
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:36,000
 a beam of light shoots out of the plane and scorches the grass near them.

485
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 The plane then smashes into the library quote, 9/11 style.

486
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,700
 Normally you can just say the plane crashed into one of the buildings.

487
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,500
 But the fact that he calls it 9/11 style is very, very important.

488
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
 If you're trying to tell a story to someone, you're like, oh, it was awful.

489
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,500
 I saw a plane crashing into a building.

490
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,400
 You might say like 9/11, but I don't think you would be like in the rendition in the style of 9/11.

491
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,700
 It's like a karaoke bar of catastrophes.

492
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,100
 But it doesn't blow up.

493
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,400
 The plane doesn't blow up.

494
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,900
 The library doesn't blow up.

495
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:20,100
 Instead, the plane immediately burst into a blue oozing vapor.

496
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,100
 So a liquid and a gas at the same time and he's watching this just like watching a

497
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,000
 balloon pop.

498
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 This oozing vapor appears and then a loud voice booms across the sky.

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 They don't say what it says.

500
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,900
 But you can imagine it would be terrifying because it's never anything nice when a voice is

501
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,600
 booming across the sky, but we don't know what it says.

502
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 And then where the blue ooze was, yellow smoke appears.

503
00:29:51,600 --> 00:30:03,000
 And the face of an almost demon, that's his, that's no three words, almost demon appears.

504
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,500
 He then finishes the story by saying this, I have, so when I read that, I thought I re-read

505
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 the beginning because I was like, is he dreaming that I missed the part where him and Antonio

506
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,900
 and Brian were snuggled up together and they all took a nap?

507
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,400
 He's not dreaming.

508
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,800
 And so this didn't happen obviously, right?

509
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
 This wasn't in the news.

510
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,400
 He said, but again, I went to, I was like, I must have missed the part where he said,

511
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,600
 I had this crazy dream the other day and then I just would have ignored it.

512
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,200
 No, he says this is how he ends the story.

513
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,700
 Quote, I have no idea what I saw because a day later, I went back to the site and I saw

514
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,800
 a hole in the library.

515
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,500
 It didn't happen.

516
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,300
 There's no hole in this library, but he's seeing a hole in the library and going back

517
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:56,600
 to the quote here, quote, and a strange shadow almost, almost in the shape of an airplane.

518
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,400
 Then he has a little airplane emoji.

519
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,000
 In case you didn't know what an airplane looked like, you're like, oh, that's what that was.

520
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,800
 It's funny because I keep saying it didn't happen, but at the same time, we're a paranormal

521
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,300
 show.

522
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
 We've actually covered stuff weirder than this.

523
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,100
 But generally, when we cover this weird stuff, it's not in civilization.

524
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,400
 We've covered stories about like monsters in the subway.

525
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,800
 We've covered stories about invisible men in suburbia, but usually a lot of times the

526
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,300
 UFOs, the beastly creatures, they're on the outskirts of humanity.

527
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,600
 This is happening in downtown Whalen, Massachusetts at the library.

528
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 It's not some abandoned street corner.

529
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,900
 It was an industrial factory and me and my friends were throwing bones and smoking cigarettes

530
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,000
 or whatever.

531
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,900
 It was in the middle of town.

532
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
 So when I keep saying it didn't happen, let me rephrase that.

533
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,800
 It didn't happen in the physical realm.

534
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,500
 It's here are the possibilities.

535
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 He's making the story up.

536
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,300
 Could be some sort of dumb ARG, right?

537
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,200
 A total waste of everyone's time.

538
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 It could be that he hallucinated it.

539
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,800
 It could be that it's just all in his head or it could be something happening in a metaphysical

540
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,000
 realm.

541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,600
 He's seeing all these events take place that basically still is a hallucination, but I

542
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,500
 would argue it would be a true hallucination.

543
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
 You see the difference.

544
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 Like one is you need to go see a doctor and you're suffering from some sort of brain damage

545
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
 or something's misfiring.

546
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,500
 The other one is that you're seeing signs and symbols and that's a really narrow line.

547
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 Right?

548
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,600
 When you need to rush to get help and have your brain looked at and the other one, well

549
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,900
 did Revradio said that I could be real?

550
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,300
 So I'm just going to keep on walking around hallucinating this stuff.

551
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,300
 I have a fourth idea, but we'll get into that one in a second.

552
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,000
 I continue to look through this guy's account and he does say later on that he actually

553
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 took a picture of this site, but he has not posted it.

554
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,500
 It's just one up a couple of days ago.

555
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,300
 So that makes it a little suspicious.

556
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,400
 He just started his account on November 9th and all he does is post.

557
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,700
 I should say all he does, but mostly he posts about 9/11 stuff and he has all these other

558
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,600
 weird conspiracy theories.

559
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:20,900
 One of them was that anti-vax movement is created and kept alive by tech companies.

560
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,900
 All these websites want people to stay inside and it didn't make any sense to me either,

561
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,000
 but basically the tech companies created the anti-vax movement so people would still

562
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,800
 be in lockdown so they'd have to continue to use Amazon and Facebook and Zoom and all

563
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 that stuff.

564
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,900
 But then I was thinking the people who are anti-vax, they're generally not just staying

565
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
 at home, right?

566
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
 They think the whole thing is they think it's not dangerous.

567
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
 That's why they're anti-vax.

568
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,200
 They're like, whatever, I'll just take my chances.

569
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,500
 So it's not like if you're anti-vax, you're not also too scared to leave your house.

570
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,240
 I didn't understand that, but that was one of his theories that it was to keep us all

571
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
 locked in.

572
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 I was like, huh, what?

573
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,600
 Like maybe I'm missing a step there, but that was one of his conspiracy theories.

574
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,940
 The other one, he posted on the subreddit, World Politics.

575
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
 He posted this one.

576
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:17,080
 It was called, "I found this essay on the WNBA's website on the Wayback Machine."

577
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
 And he doesn't post the link.

578
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,440
 He posts the essay and it says that if you look at people who have smartphones, they're

579
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,240
 idiots.

580
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,400
 And let me read this to you.

581
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:35,240
 "If you start to observe, a phone is a somewhat life support device for your brain and it

582
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,760
 acts as a vessel to think for you.

583
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,560
 When you don't have the phone, you can barely think for yourself.

584
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,120
 It leads to tech dependence and then you will be completely controlled by a technological

585
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
 device."

586
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:51,240
 And apparently this essay was written on June 23rd, 1993 by Cheryl Swoops.

587
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,680
 Who the hell is Cheryl Swoops?

588
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,680
 She is a WNBA star who went on to be a WNBA coach.

589
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,560
 I don't understand, I don't understand, one, how she wrote an essay about smart devices

590
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,600
 in the year 1993.

591
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 That's pretty spectacular.

592
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,520
 We need to get her on this show.

593
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,000
 That's a new note, if you're on this.

594
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,440
 Why the WNBA has anything to do with any of this.

595
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,120
 What?

596
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,320
 So I don't get it.

597
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,160
 I don't really get where this guy's coming from now.

598
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,080
 If it isn't ARG, I apologize for wasting everybody's time.

599
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:31,320
 I have, basically my theories are this guy's either ranting this stuff, that he's making

600
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,640
 these connections that don't exist.

601
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,240
 They're interesting conspiracy theories and you can make a big argument about, I don't

602
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,520
 have to remember people's phone numbers because I have them programmed into my phone.

603
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,320
 I think there is an argument to be made that a phone is a backup brain.

604
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,360
 So we may not be as, we may not memorize this stuff as much.

605
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,840
 That's an interesting argument, interesting conspiracy theory even.

606
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,280
 But the anti-vax thing is completely ridiculous.

607
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,160
 The anti-vax, the bots pushing it so people stay home and play Facebook and farm villain

608
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 and all that stuff.

609
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
 I think it's a little more ridiculous.

610
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,480
 But going back to the original post, could be hallucinating it, could be he's seeing

611
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,120
 a series of signs and visions.

612
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,280
 We just had that episode about Arthur Stillwell, who was hearing these voices and it led him

613
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,080
 to build the United States fascinating episode.

614
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
 It was just Friday's episode.

615
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,960
 Then I always have this conspiracy theory and we'll wrap it up like this.

616
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,360
 And it's not even conspiracy theory, it's conspiracy fact.

617
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,720
 I don't know if this one falls in that realm.

618
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,560
 But this is how people pass codes.

619
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,000
 This is how it's easy way for people to pass codes.

620
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,600
 If I am an agent of the NSA or CIA or whatever and I need to get a message to somebody else,

621
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,680
 you can write nonsense like that.

622
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,680
 And it sounds like nonsense to everyone unless you have the code.

623
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,480
 I've run into that stuff personally.

624
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,640
 We've done a couple episodes on it.

625
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,800
 It's weird.

626
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,080
 It's weird and I think that's what this might be.

627
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,120
 I mean, we'll never know unless this person emails me and goes, "Thanks dude, you've

628
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,080
 compromised the agent that we currently have in Pakistan."

629
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,960
 It'll be interesting to see if this account goes blank.

630
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,080
 It'll be interesting to see if this account just disappears.

631
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,840
 I don't think that this episode will make this account disappear.

632
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,920
 But that was kind of my thing.

633
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,200
 When I read it, I go, "That's an interesting idea.

634
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,760
 What an interesting set of visuals."

635
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,320
 You can picture the story and then I go, "This is a great view of someone who is on the cusp

636
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,160
 of possibly losing their mind, a disorganized insanity versus an organized insanity."

637
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,920
 And then I thought, "Or this whole thing is just two agents passing messages back and

638
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
 forth."

639
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,120
 They share the account and they're doing stuff and they post this and it looks like gibberish.

640
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,880
 And most people would just discount it as the rambling of a madman.

641
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,200
 But if you knew the code, very, very important information has been passed back and forth.

642
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,480
 So that's when you're investigating this stuff, right?

643
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,080
 It's really easy for me to say, "Oh, this didn't happen, this didn't happen, this didn't

644
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
 happen."

645
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,360
 But the story is always more complex than that.

646
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,040
 So as long as it's not an ARG, I think the other three options are really, really interesting.

647
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,640
 The sentence of madness, a man seeing signs of the universe no one else can perceive, or

648
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,720
 a hidden network of spies and ne'er-do-wells passing codes openly online.

649
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,480
 The world of conspiracy is a fascinating place to play, to explore, to learn, laugh and love,

650
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,760
 but don't chase the clicks.

651
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,840
 Alex, do what you love, don't chase the clicks.

652
00:38:44,840 --> 00:39:06,440

653
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:20,120
 It's a world of trouble.

654
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:39,280
 It's a world of trouble.

655
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,440
 It's a world of trouble.

656
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:53,440
