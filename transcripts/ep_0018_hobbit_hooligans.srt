00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 The despair code and is Lord of the Rings based on true world history.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 [music]

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,040
 Hey everyone, this is Jason Carpenter back for another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,040
 I'm currently being held hostage by a cover band playing about a half a block away.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,040
 So my window is shut and I'm getting no fresh air and I can still hear a bit of a cover

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,880
 of what are they playing now?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,320
 They were originally playing Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,280
 It's quite odd to have a song that was kind of the rebellious song.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
 One of the big rebellious songs of my youth being played in front of Mike's ice cream

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
 is a bunch of toddlers and dirty diapers are dancing to it.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
 It's cool.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,240
 I mean, the songs lived this long but I just remember watching that video and you know,

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,560
 parents are like "oh why are they wearing that flannel?

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,200
 Why are they dressed like that?"

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,720
 And now it's totally mainstream.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
 You know one thing I've always wanted to see come back?

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,120
 Cross colors.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,800
 I would wear cross colors now.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,960
 I always like cross colors.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,040
 I didn't have enough money back then because I was only a 15 year old kid but you know,

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,800
 like the red, they kind of had like the African colors vibe that was always good.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,160
 And then what were those shirts that were like heat sensitive that you'd like touch

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,680
 it and you could leave your hand print?

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,920
 Those were pretty dope.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,440
 They should bring those back too.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,920
 They should bring back.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
 Yeah, how come that's not coming back?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,160
 How come they're doing all this 80s stuff still?

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,280
 When do I get my 90s retro?

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 I guess they're doing a Are You Afraid of the Dark movie?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
 It's kind of 90s.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,680
 So today we're going to talk about the despair code and is Lord of the Rings based on real

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
 life?

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,640
 And I'm kind of iffy about which one we're going to talk about first.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,000
 I'm going to go ahead and flip this coin.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,280
 We're going to go completely random.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,880
 So I have a bit of a love hate relationship with the Hobbit.

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,040
 Whoa, everyone has a love hate relationship with the Hobbit.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,760
 I have a love hate relationship with Lord of the Rings.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,680
 I'm not a big fantasy fan, but I was a big Peter Jackson fan and I was really looking

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,840
 forward to seeing his take on this property.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,880
 I'd seen Dead Alive and all that stuff and Heavenly Creatures and the Frighteners.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,480
 But anyways, anyways, the so I go to see Lord of the Rings, sorry, the Fellowship of the

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,600
 Ring opening day first showing.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,440
 I was super excited to be supporting one of my favorite directors.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,880
 I was very curious to see if this would go.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,600
 I walk into to watch the Fellowship of the Ring and something seems really off because

49
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,520
 they showed a scene where like the ring gets lost in the beginning to show the opening

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,480
 prologue which was amazing with Sauron like destroying all the troops and his hand getting

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,100
 cut off the ring fallen in the water.

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,280
 And then I think they showed something and then it was just then they're in Bilbo's

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,360
 village and they're doing all the stuff and I was like, wait, did all that stuff happen

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 yesterday?

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
 I don't get what's going on.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 I knew the Sauron got killed but how the ring was just in the lake.

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,240
 It's like I thought Gollum had it for a while or something like that for like quite a period

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
 of time.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,160
 So I'm watching the movie and I don't really think anything of it and then I realize I'm

60
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,640
 like dude, this, the cinema, I mean the movie just doesn't look right.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,540
 It looked really, really, really cheap.

62
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,440
 And so we get to the scene where they go to where all the elves hang out, Rivendale, River,

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:45,040
 Rivendale and he's talking to that chick, the elf chick and they're talking in Elvish and

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,560
 I'm just sitting there and I'm like, what are they saying?

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
 It's like a five minute long scene and he's like, the sword's all broken.

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
 I'm like, what the hell, am I supposed to know Elvish?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 And I'm like, I get it.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,960
 I've seen Star Trek and sometimes they don't always translate the Klingons but come on,

69
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
 this scene's going on a little too long.

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,280
 What the hell are these people saying?

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 So I remember walking out and I was just not very impressed by that movie.

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,520
 I always said it looked like it was filmed by a bunch of kids in their backyard, like

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
 that woods behind their house.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,560
 It was just nothing was super cinematic about it.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,600
 I found out a couple weeks later I was talking to someone about it.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,960
 I was like, dude, what was up with that scene where they're just talking in Elvish?

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
 They're like, oh, they were talking about the sword and getting it repaired.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
 And I was like, how do you know that?

79
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,960
 And they're like, because there were subtitles, dude.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,880
 The movie was cropped off a good foot at the bottom of the screen.

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,520
 So I missed at the beginning when it said like 60 years later.

82
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
 So because it just looked like it was the next day, someone's like, oh, look it, now

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,360
 we're having this big party.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,640
 All of the subtitles for the movie were gone.

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,760
 And you'd be surprised if you cut off a foot of a screen, how badly framed every shot was.

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,680
 Everyone was like below the knee.

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
 Everyone was cut off below the knee.

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,680
 It looked super, super cheap.

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
 It was so funny.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
 Then I went and saw the two towers.

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,800
 And I saw that multiple times in theater.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
 This is one of my favorite films for quite a while.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It still holds up.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's super well.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I've never seen a siege done in a movie like that before.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
 And then I was super stoked for Return of the King.

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,480
 And to me, it wasn't as good as two towers, but it was really good.

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,800
 And I will say this, if any soundtrack is better, if any like, orchestral soundtrack is better

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,640
 than Star Wars, the original trilogy soundtrack, it's Lord of the Rings.

100
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,320
 I mean, that is an amazingly epic soundtrack.

101
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,120
 All of that being said, imagine living in a world where you believed those events were

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
 real.

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
 The Battle of Helms Deep.

104
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
 The Destruction of the Ring.

105
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,280
 The Great Enemy Living in the Volcano, which I've touched on before.

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,120
 I like that imagery of the people who think that the bad guys live in the black smoking

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
 wasteland.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
 It's very easy to fight that enemy.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,760
 It's a lot harder to fight the enemy when it's a normal person with their own hopes

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,960
 and dreams and stuff like that.

111
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,360
 But anyways, so this is based on real events.

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,120
 What if I told you that J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of those books and many more, was

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,880
 in the basement of the Oxford Library, found the ancient history of the world and wrote

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
 Lord of the Rings.

115
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
 Well, that's what J. Weidner believes.

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,000
 He is a researcher when it comes to this Hollywood and pop culture and Hollywood and conspiracy.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,520
 He has a YouTube show or has like a radio show on it.

118
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,240
 He does a lot of videos and things like that about the subject.

119
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,400
 So he is the one who has the belief that J. R. R. Tolkien found the secret history of

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,480
 the world back from about 6,500 years ago, which would kind of predate the Bible, easily

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,480
 predate the Bible, pushing it towards, if you're looking at the biblical calendar around

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,440
 the time of the floods.

123
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,600
 He believes this, that Sauron is from Saturn.

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,520
 It's an alien being with an alien army.

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
 More on that later.

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,920
 The rings are in reference to the rings of Saturn.

127
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,400
 So the ring of power is not an actual literal ring, but it's a reference to where he came

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,000
 from that he also represents, he's based, and I know this is going to get a little weird,

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
 but he's based on a, what was it, Macedonian?

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,600
 You don't want to get these facts wrong because they're super important.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,280
 Let's see, where'd you go?

132
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,640
 Okay, and so the enemy's name is Sauron and quoting him, "Sauron is obviously so close

133
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,880
 to the Mesopotamian dictator Sargon who invented time."

134
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,720
 And he literally invented clocks, calendar schedules, and really delivered the world

135
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,720
 into the linear monochromatic world that we live in now.

136
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,920
 Now okay, I'm going to break character as a conspiracy believer right now, just take

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,480
 a moment out.

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,400
 Nobody invents time.

139
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 You can invent the measurement of time, but time exists.

140
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,640
 Plants grow, plants die, they become fertilizer, new plants grow.

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,760
 If I don't have a ruler, there's still distance involved from how I walk.

142
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,560
 But anyways, so this guy believes that Sauron is based on this and it's all about the manipulating,

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,040
 bringing earth into the slavery.

144
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,800
 And the orcs are like alien clones.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,640
 And I keep saying the Hobbits are from Ireland because I think for some reason that's the

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 funniest visual.

147
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,960
 Like, the Irish people already have bad enough reputations as is, but now you want them to

148
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,960
 be like the wimpyest of all mythological creatures and the furriest and the fattest of all of

149
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
 them.

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,440
 What's interesting about this guy is that he starts off with a relatively interesting

151
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,080
 concept and then he realizes he doesn't have enough to write an 8000 word article, which

152
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,200
 is what this is roughly.

153
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
 And he's done videos on this.

154
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,320
 This website is actually citing his work, but he's done tons of videos on this and things

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 like that.

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,880
 This is just the easiest way to share via podcast.

157
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,080
 He realizes there's really not enough information to back this up.

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 So then he goes into this weird thing about giants.

159
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,360
 How humans are giant, humans, we have giant, we found giant skeletons and for proof he

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,560
 shows some poorly photoshopped pictures and he says, "Look, proof."

161
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,600
 Then he starts talking about how researchers have been killed and these bones are being

162
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,000
 hidden by the government.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,440
 Totally different conspiracy, but whatever.

164
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,160
 Then he goes into a third conspiracy saying, "Maybe we're not seeing the good stuff.

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,280
 But an uncensored, financed, detailed investigation reveal bones of."

166
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:49,080
 Centars, Minotars, Unicorns, Pegasus, Cerebus, Hydra, Griffins, Dragons, Orcs, Cyclops,

167
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,800
 Mermaids, Harpies, Pixies, Chimeras, Kraken's and other mythological creatures.

168
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:03,880
 What would a pixie skeleton look like?

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,280
 But we're not done.

170
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,440
 Because then he goes from this idea that the government is hiding harpy skeletons from

171
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,880
 us to the fact that the great flood, from biblical times mind you, was not to wipe away

172
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,280
 the sinners of the world, but to destroy, you know what, I'm going to let him say it.

173
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,600
 "I believe the great flood also killed animals that were cloned.

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,720
 We have mythological Greek and Roman legends of a half-man half-horse, three-headed dog,

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,840
 all these mythical animals.

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:43,400
 They may have been genetic experiments, all that had to be wiped out in a flood to lower

177
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,640
 radiation levels and to just get rid of the cloned monster madness.

178
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,960
 And what else would we be left with but the pyramids and fantastic constructions that we

179
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,640
 can't build today."

180
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,320
 This is like conspiracy theory convergence.

181
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
 We have ancient aliens.

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,520
 We have hidden history.

183
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,760
 We have the government covering up the bodies and the bones of the Kraken.

184
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,240
 How you would even know Kraken bones existed they'd be at the bottom.

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,400
 But anyways, I digress, I digress.

186
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,640
 This is like conspiracy theory convergence and he's just kind of reaching and grabbing

187
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,080
 and throwing all of this stuff in.

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,240
 This guy has a big following, not a huge following, not a huge following, but people listen to

189
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
 this.

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
 It reinforces their worldview.

191
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,920
 Hidden history is one of those things I find it completely fascinating.

192
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,440
 I don't think we know everything about the world.

193
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,880
 I think the historical texts we have are lacking, greatly lacking.

194
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,080
 But I don't think they were cloning monsters.

195
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,760
 I don't think that a guide came down and invented time and he's like, "Oh, now I will

196
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,720
 control you unless you can destroy the rings."

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
 And it was some power ship that he had from Saturn and so on and so forth.

198
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,360
 But this guy believes it.

199
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,080
 Now, I think it's pretty obvious.

200
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,920
 I don't believe a word of this.

201
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,360
 I don't believe an absolute word of this.

202
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,920
 But people do and you can sell anything nowadays.

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,080
 So of course, Tolkien is dead.

204
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
 He keeps referencing these letters.

205
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,440
 Like, Tolkien would get mad when people said it was just an analogy.

206
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,000
 And show us the letters.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,680
 Show, you know, you're throwing out there, there's, I get you don't have evidence that

208
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:33,480
 a giant Minotaur was beating up an Irishman and their bones, someone found the Minotaur

209
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,600
 bones and got rid of them and then the Irish were like, "Let's just prop this skeleton

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
 up and put a bear in his hand."

211
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,800
 I get that you don't have those photos, but you should have copies of those letters.

212
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,080
 But I don't know why I'm still a little surprised when people believe stuff that doesn't have

213
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,640
 a ton of evidence.

214
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,440
 I want to do an episode on how to create a conspiracy theory and that's part of it.

215
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,600
 Create a conspiracy and the first thing you have to do is to have as little evidence as

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
 possible.

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,800
 And actually, you know, I think I might do that for my next episode because I've been

218
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
 throwing that around a bit.

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
 I think that's very interesting.

220
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,680
 He picked a time period that's so far back.

221
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,440
 You can't find any record for it anyways.

222
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,080
 But he messed up by saying Tolkien talked about it in letters, but can't, if he could

223
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,400
 show me letters, Tolkien was like, "No, this is based on true events.

224
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
 I've been to the basement in Oxford."

225
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,080
 Totally different story.

226
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 Show us the letters.

227
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,320
 He doesn't have letters.

228
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,040
 So if he doesn't have those letters, maybe he should despair.

229
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,560
 Should we go to the despair code now?

230
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,440
 Now, you know what's funny is the despair code actually plays into this in a way.

231
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:51,360
 The despair code can either be seen as a great boon to conspiracy theorists or the reason

232
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,640
 why you should be completely terrified.

233
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,640
 So the despair code, once again, is a very, very obscure conspiracy theory.

234
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,800
 It took me even longer to find information, good information on this than it did for the

235
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,120
 Lord of the Rings thing.

236
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,900
 Okay, so let me give you a brief overview.

237
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,880
 So this is what the despair code is, roughly.

238
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,660
 The despair code is this.

239
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,880
 Everyone views reality as they see it.

240
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,740
 Everyone is basically, we are all going to experience reality on a different level.

241
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,140
 So I may experience reality on a level where I'm very happy and I think that the world

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,240
 is going great and those things will start to be reflected in my life and you may go,

243
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
 "Oh man, life is crappy and everything sucks."

244
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,020
 And you'll start to see things that reflect back in the world, your worldview.

245
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,660
 That's a very basic view of it, but that's not the despair code, but that's kind of the

246
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
 basic setup.

247
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,260
 So how you perceive the world is how the world works with you.

248
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,860
 People who are happy go lucky tend to, even when they stumble, they find a good way to

249
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,140
 deal with it, they kind of move on.

250
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,980
 People who are constantly grumpy and upset, when they bump into an obstacle, they see

251
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,800
 it as the world's worst thing because they already have a negative worldview.

252
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
 Now what the despair code is, is it takes it a step further.

253
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,360
 So let's say, and this is an example on this post.

254
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,400
 So let's say you and I are walking through a dark alley, we're walking through separate

255
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 dark alleys.

256
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,480
 You know, listen, I know that we've spent some time together, but I don't recommend walking

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,040
 through dark alleys with me, just like I don't recommend camping with me or having your car

258
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,280
 break down on a highway with me.

259
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,540
 But anyway, so I'm walking through a dark alley and I hear a noise behind me and I don't know

260
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,740
 what it is and I turn around and I go, "That's a cat."

261
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,500
 It's just a cat and I keep walking and that's a cat in the alley because my mind is perceiving

262
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,100
 it to be a cat.

263
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:54,940
 And if you're walking down the alley and you hear a noise and you go, "It's a monster."

264
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,500
 It's a monster because you're basically shifting your reality to how you believe.

265
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:09,360
 So it goes on to say to someone who has hallucinations and if they see, if they think it is a eight

266
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,320
 armed cat with two heads and they're each like snarling in German because the wiring

267
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,240
 in their brain is messed up anyways, they are actually seeing that.

268
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,840
 Like I'll turn around and I won't see anything and go, "That's a cat."

269
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,400
 You turn around and don't see anything and you go, "That's a monster."

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,240
 Because we don't have enough information, we're creating that.

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,860
 Someone who has an actual hallucination, they're creating it and they can smell it and they

272
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,940
 can see it and they can hear it.

273
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,900
 So they've kind of broken through the code, the coding.

274
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,980
 They actually are getting the stimulus that I don't see the cat, you don't see the monster,

275
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,340
 but anyways, so because we basically make our reality as we think it, it's kind of writing

276
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,300
 on the fly, we can create problems for ourselves.

277
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,200
 So you're thinking, "Okay, but that doesn't, why would that cause despair?

278
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,440
 Why would that cause problems?"

279
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,520
 This is kind of, I think, the meat of the post and this is what I wanted to really read.

280
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,440
 We are the universe.

281
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,640
 Everyone is the universe by himself.

282
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,440
 By talking and communicating, we exchange data with other universes.

283
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,760
 So I'm in one universe where it's just a cat and you're in another universe where it was

284
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,920
 a monster.

285
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,560
 And when we talk, we're facing each other, but we're actually conversing between realities

286
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,140
 because we can't really intrude on each other's realities.

287
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,340
 We're just basically reading each other's energy and that's what we touch and feel and

288
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,900
 things like that.

289
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,340
 We live on the same planet, same place, but are still somehow separated by our body, but

290
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,300
 still connected through communication.

291
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:50,140
 Keeping that in mind, anything you imagine to be real is real.

292
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,580
 If you think you are followed, you are.

293
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,960
 If you believe there is a monster in your closet, there is.

294
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,400
 There moves something in the corner of your eye?

295
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 Guess what?

296
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
 It wasn't only an imagination.

297
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,520
 Following these thoughts all the time will eventually make your mind fragile and paranoid

298
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,040
 until your mind dissolves into despair of all things that are out there to get you.

299
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,920
 These line of thoughts, the realization that everything is real and admitting this, is

300
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,140
 the despair code.

301
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,220
 Okay, so that's basically it.

302
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,180
 The despair code is the idea that every paranoid thought you have, every worry and fear is

303
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,140
 real.

304
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,700
 And once you start, you basically, you're regressing to a childlike state.

305
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,860
 Because when you're a child and you hear something under your bed, it's a monster and then someone

306
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,620
 has to explain to you that monsters aren't real.

307
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,400
 But if you buy into the despair code, you hear that and you think it's a monster.

308
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 It is a monster.

309
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
 It's an app, it's a monster because your mind is creating that reality.

310
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
 Until you look under that bed to see that it's not a monster, it is a monster.

311
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
 The monster exists because you believe it exists.

312
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,400
 Because we're, we can only experience the reality that we perceive, that we're reading.

313
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,960
 I can't perceive your reality.

314
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,160
 You can't perceive my reality.

315
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,380
 We can communicate between dimensions, but in the end we're in our own reality.

316
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
 Here's the thing.

317
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,740
 I do think there's some truth to that, but I think they're looking at it from the wrong

318
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,980
 angle.

319
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,100
 I think it's basically the secret turned evil.

320
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,060
 It's the secret from Sauron is what it is.

321
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,440
 It's this idea that everything, every, if you think someone's coming up behind you with

322
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
 a knife, guess what?

323
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,400
 Someone's coming up behind you with a knife.

324
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,320
 If you don't turn around and look and prove that he's not there, he's there.

325
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,160
 And eventually you're not going to look.

326
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,760
 You're going to try to convince yourself that he's not there and you're going to feel

327
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,240
 the blade go through the back and pop your lung.

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
 That's the despair code.

329
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,880
 However, I would say, I sit around.

330
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 I don't sit around.

331
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 I work hard.

332
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,320
 I know I'm kind of a bumbling fact.

333
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,040
 I have half the facts and bumbling.

334
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,100
 I mispronounce a bunch of words, but I really enjoy doing this podcast.

335
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
 I really enjoy the format.

336
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,180
 I don't spend my free time just, you know, dicking around.

337
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,900
 I'm looking for ways to market the podcast.

338
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,500
 I'm constantly talking up my podcast.

339
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,340
 I'm constantly going places, trying to build up a podcast audience.

340
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,940
 And while I'm doing that, I'm imagining my podcast audience growing.

341
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,420
 I'm taking action and I'm visualizing people discovering my podcast.

342
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,440
 And guess what?

343
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,720
 Everyday people discover my podcast.

344
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 Coincidence?

345
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 Yeah, sure.

346
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 Possibly.

347
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,240
 I'm doing the flag work, but I'm imagining, I'm visualizing people discovering my podcast

348
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,600
 and enjoying it and being like, "Oh, that's so funny.

349
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,600
 Like, it's this weird comedy podcast where he's kind of an idiot, but at the same time

350
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 he's really earnest."

351
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,240
 Ho, ho, ho.

352
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,640
 So you know, this is a good podcast.

353
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,200
 I'm going to record it to my friends.

354
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
 I visualize myself.

355
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
 I visualize myself losing weight.

356
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,460
 I tell myself, "I'm losing weight.

357
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,660
 I'm losing weight every day.

358
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,900
 I visualize these things."

359
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,460
 So you can hack the system.

360
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,980
 You can hack your reality.

361
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
 I truly believe that.

362
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,540
 I think there might be some limitations to it.

363
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 But I think you can.

364
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,620
 I think that a spare code, in a sense, is real.

365
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,100
 If you are constantly negative and you're thinking there's a monster in the bushes, there's a

366
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,220
 monster in the bushes, maybe there is a monster in the bushes.

367
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,640
 Maybe it's not a, you know, Google Ox.

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,600
 Maybe it's not like this giant furry beast, but there's something there that's drawing

369
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,620
 negative energy, you know, putting negative energy on you, pulling good energy away.

370
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,040
 Maybe it is an actual monster.

371
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,560
 I don't know.

372
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,480
 But if you go through life and you're not imagining the monster, or you hear that noise

373
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,880
 and you go, "Ah, it's just a cat."

374
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,000
 Now, don't get me wrong.

375
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,680
 I am a fairly paranoid person.

376
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,440
 I don't, if I hear something behind me, I don't automatically go, "Oh, it's just a

377
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,940
 fluffy cat, just so some guy can like take me to his rape dungeon."

378
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,620
 Like I am fairly paranoid as far as that goes.

379
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,140
 But I don't let that become the quote-unquote "despair code."

380
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,380
 If I'm walking through the dark, my guard's up.

381
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,300
 If I'm in public, my guard's up.

382
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,980
 But when I'm sitting at home, I'm doing stuff or whatever.

383
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,820
 Even if I start to get a negative thought, I try to break that negative cycle and put

384
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,380
 in positive thoughts.

385
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,260
 That's been a big part about this podcast.

386
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,280
 So, let me just say, I know a lot of people tune in to kind of hear these weird or conspiracy

387
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
 theories.

388
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,880
 And I know I have a contingent of listeners who like this stuff and I don't want them

389
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,920
 to be like, "Oh, man, now I know about the despair code and I'm thinking there's a monster

390
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,040
 around my bed."

391
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,320
 It is what you make of it.

392
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,480
 The code, I think, does have a seed of truth to it, unlike that stupid Lord of the Rings

393
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 thing.

394
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,160
 And I guess if you believe that Lord of the Rings is injured as a spare code and blah,

395
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,320
 blah, blah, then maybe in your reality, the Lord of the Rings.

396
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,640
 Lord of the Rings is a true story, but we're in my reality right now and that's dumb.

397
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,960
 That's so stupid.

398
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,220
 But anyways, take those negative thoughts, turn them into positive thoughts.

399
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,260
 Be a positive thinker.

400
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,300
 Trust me, trust me, it will treat you well.

401
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,540
 I think that's going to be it for tonight.

402
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,780
 I've done so many variations and so many edits of this episode.

403
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,900
 I talked about Lord of the Rings for probably a half hour straight.

404
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,140
 I had to go in and completely chop stuff up and rerecord that.

405
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,980
 That was my despair code.

406
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,500
 Was that stupid Lord of the Rings story?

407
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,240
 Because sometimes stuff is too dumb to even comment on.

408
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,960
 So funny, I talk about positive thoughts and then I just talk trash about this guy forever.

409
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
 But I think you know what I mean.

410
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,800
 The despair code, yes, is real.

411
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,320
 But turn it into the pair code.

412
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,560
 Is pair the opposite of despair?

413
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
 Despair, pair, whatever.

414
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,280
 Anyways, have happy thoughts.

415
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,560
 There is no monster under your bed, regardless of what reality you're in.

416
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
 Just remember that.

417
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,300
 That doesn't mean you shouldn't lock your door at night.

418
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,060
 This is the part of the podcast where I just kind of start talking in circles and I hope

419
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,780
 that the exit music is starting.

420
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,380
 Is it going right there?

421
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
 I don't know.

422
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
 I'm the one in charge of putting the exit music in.

423
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,460
 But you know, we'll see.

 And that will be it for today.

429
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,000
 My voice is actually going hoarse.

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,240
 You have no idea how long I've been recording this episode, but trust me, it was totally

431
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
 worth it.

432
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
 I'm having a great time.

433
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,240
 I'm hoping you're enjoying the show and we will see you tomorrow.

434
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
 That was kind of like an outro.

435
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
 I might keep that.
