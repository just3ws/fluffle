1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A man who was so bad at baseball, he went to jail.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we traveled to Kelvin, Arizona to take a look at the story of four men who were out there one day looking for rocks.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Instead they found one of the most puzzling UFO stories we've ever covered.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm not having a great day and I want to be honest with you guys, but I really do hope you're having a great day.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm struggling with the news coming out of Texas of the guy walking into the elementary school and shooting a bunch of little kids.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Little kids.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm not saying it's okay to shoot adults, right? I'm not saying that.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 But little kids, you know what I mean?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So what I wanted to do today felt like I needed to take a little bit of break because the stuff we cover on the show can be pretty dark and I need to clear my head.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So I wanted to cover some stories today that were fun.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Fun, true, fun, true crime stories.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And then a really fun alien story to end the week at. We'll be back next week, but and it will be back to normal depressing stuff.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But I wanted to have one day where we had some fun stuff.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So I started digging through all of my notes and I found two really cool stories to talk about.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I wanted to bring in today's legacy Patreon supporter walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Everyone give it up for hot Digity Dane.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Oh yeah, come on in. Come on hot Digity Dane's like you okay bro?

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's just clap silently hot Digity Dane. You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And I want to say this too hot Digity Dane left a really cool review about the podcast that he was up to actually be on the legacy Patreon list.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I have like a list we rotate through.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I also loved that review you left my friend long time listener of the show long time supporter of the show hot Digity Dane.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I hope you are ready to be flying these vehicles and driving these vehicles and taking us wherever we need to go for these fun, fun stories.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First off hot Digity Dane. I'm going to toss you a conductor's cap and a shovel to get that coal in the carbon or caboose.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're choo-choo-choo on all the way out to Chattanooga, Tennessee.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This is an old timey story so get on your pantalons and your sepia-toned clothes.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 We're going back to your 1885. Back in 1885 baseball was the thing.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 People were walking around with bats. They weren't droogs. They weren't beating up homeless people.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 They were walking around with bats and balls. They were ready to play baseball.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Baseball fever had struck in the United States.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 At this time you had a lot of baseball teams but the way it worked, it's 1885.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 You couldn't pick up the phone. You couldn't zoom call with somebody.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 You could pretty much, if you were a team and you needed new players, you could scout for players east of St. Louis, Missouri.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You could actually take a train, go out to a game in Boston and be like, "Crack! Look at that ball go!"

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 There goes Jerry Mann and Jerry Mann's running around and some guys are like, "Oh, I want him for my team!"

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But if you wanted a player west of St. Louis, Missouri, they really hadn't had any infrastructure built for that.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I mean, the trains and stuff like that, it still wasn't just bare and wild land.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But the baseball organizations didn't have its tentacles in the west.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And so people are constantly fighting for the same pool of players.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 You would basically be having agents go out and they're not going to be able to get a guy who's currently on a team.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And then everyone would be scouting out the colleges. I wonder if they had high school baseball back then.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I could have easily Googled it but I didn't.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You could only find so many players and you had all these different teams trying to get players.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 So what would happen is you would have to start to turn west.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But you didn't have any scouts out there.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 The Eastern teams didn't have anyone out there whose job was just to look for a baseball player.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 So this is how they did it back then.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 They asked you. They basically would say, "How good are you?"

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And the players would go, "I'm the best. I'm the best baseball player west of St. Louis, Missouri. You never heard of me? I'm the best!"

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You would just send them your stats. You would just send them. Not like on a official paper or nothing.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 It was actually judged by anyone. You could write down how good you were and you would submit it to teams in the east.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Because that was the place to play. We did have teams in the west, like in California and stuff like that.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 But you wanted to be on the east coast. That's where the big teams were. The big franchises were out east.

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 In 1885, the city of Chattanooga, for their team, they are looking for new players.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And in 1885, Jack Sheridan, a 23-year-old man in San Jose, California, begins writing letters to baseball teams all over the east coast, talking about how good he was.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Talking about all the different teams he played for in San Francisco. And Chattanooga, the Chattanooga lookouts, they decided to believe all these letters.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And they sent him train money to head on out east. He's super excited. Yes!

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Finally, he'll be able to play ball with the big boys. So he gets his money, gets on the train, and it still takes a while to get over there.

62
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 It's not like Amtrak today, where you're across the country in like two days. These are old choo-choo trains.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So he gets to Chattanooga, and the Chattanooga lookouts are like, "Dude, we saw your stats." And it's time to play ball.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Imagine as the train pulls up, they're like, "Hurry up, hurry up, Jack!" The game started 10 minutes ago.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 He starts playing for the Chattanooga lookouts, and he sucks.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 He's terrible. He's so bad at baseball, he becomes famous for being bad at baseball.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 In 1940, so what is that? 60 years later, there's an article being written about Jack Sheridan, and in this article they quoted a guy named Mike Fisher.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He was the co-founder of the Pacific Coast League, and he said about Jack Sheridan he couldn't quote, "Field the ball with a fishnet, or hit one with a tennis racket."

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Unquote.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So imagine 60 years after your career started, people were still making comments about how bad you were.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He was so terrible that historians don't understand how this happened. They go, "How do the Chattanooga lookouts get bamboozled by this guy?

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 We don't have the letters that he actually sent out to the Chattanooga lookouts."

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 People would love to see how badly he exaggerated his numbers.

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 But some people say because we don't have the actual letters he wrote to the Chattanooga lookouts, a lot of people think he lied.

75
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 A lot of people think that he actually was bamboozling them the entire time.

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 When he was writing these letters, he's like, "Oh yeah, once I hit this ball and it flew around the earth twice and hit Pluto in the back of the head.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I eat me spinach." Some people think that he actually lied.

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Other people say he was telling the truth, but his stats were West Coast stats.

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 So against all these other teams on the West Coast which was completely removed from the East Coast League, he was a good player.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 But when you got out and you were playing with these teams that were filled with the best players on the East Coast, right, everyone's going after the same talent pool.

81
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 They're constantly trying to get the very best players who are competing against the very best players.

82
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And then all of these washouts in California are just writing down notes.

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Some people say that his stats were correct. He just was not playing very good players.

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He was so bad though. He got arrested and went to jail.

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 What happened was the Chattanooga Lookouts, after several games and just practicing with this guy, probably just hanging out with him, he's like, "What? I can eat 50 steaks in one sitting.

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And once I chop down an entire forest with one swing of my axe." They're like, "Okay, that last one was bald bunion." And we know that's not true.

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 He was sent to jail for fraud.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 The Chattanooga Lookouts actually went to the police and said, "This guy said he was going to baseball. We sent him money to take a train over here. That was not cheap. That was not cheap."

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 He lied to us. They went to the police. The police issued a warrant for his arrest for fraud.

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And he ended up being found guilty for fraud. He was kicked off the team and he was ordered to pay them the money back.

91
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Like a court order, a judge goes, "You are so bad at baseball. I've seen those games. I was betting on the Chattanooga Lookouts. You cost me a lot of money. I order you to pay back your train ticket."

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Jack Sheridan got a job at a local cigarette factory to make enough money to pay his ticket back. And he's sitting there and he's like, "Rolling cigarettes? One for you? One for me."

93
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Making all these cigarettes. And he's sitting on this assembly line and thinking, "This isn't the end of good old Jack Sheridan."

94
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 This is so awesome. I love this story. Jack Sheridan did not give up on his dream.

95
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 His dream was playing baseball. He wasn't good at baseball. But he kept playing.

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 He played for a team in Kentucky. He played for a team in Atlanta. And they're lying to each other. Really that good.

97
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Like sure, you do give us free cigarettes. You have these pockets full of tobacco. But you're not that good.

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And I think he starts to realize that he might be West Coast good, but he doesn't want to go back there, right?

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 He probably owes a bunch of money for fraud out there as well. So he decides, you know, I love baseball so much, I just want to be part of the game.

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He becomes an umpire. People say until Jack Sheridan started umpiring, umpires were universally hated, right?

101
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And those are the people who are going, "Foul ball! You're out of here, strike!"

102
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 People don't like their calls. The players don't like the calls. It's just a huge thing. But Jack Sheridan, he was so good at his job that people respected him.

103
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And in turn, he kind of set the standard for what an umpire should do.

104
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He basically took a job everyone hated and made it respected because you respected Jack Sheridan and the new umpires were following his model.

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He makes such a name for himself that he ends up becoming a trusted friend of Ben Johnson who created the National League, which is half of Major League Baseball.

106
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Now you have the National League and the American League. And the whole time he's been an umpire, he's setting the standard for what it means to be an umpire.

107
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And he was also an undertaker. So sometimes he'd be like, "You know what? I don't know if I'm going to come back next season.

108
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I really need to have a job where people respect me. There's just a bunch of dead bodies there."

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And Ben Johnson would have to talk them back each season. He's like, "No, dude, listen. You're the best umpire. You are what everyone else strives for in this industry."

110
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Well, the umpiring part, not the baseball part. We got baseball players who strive to be better baseball players, but you, Jack Sheridan, you need to be this umpire.

111
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And it was interesting, right? You have a guy who had a dream to be one thing and it didn't work out, but he loved it so much.

112
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 He stayed a part of the organization and he created this position, right? It did exist. But everyone just threw tomatoes at him all the time.

113
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And if they're lucky, sometimes it was a 92-mile-an-hour speedball right at the back of their head.

114
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I think that would actually be manslaughter if a baseball player did that.

115
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Well, player did that. But in the end, he says, "Yeah, I'll be an umpire." He's waving goodbye to the bodies. He's like, "Oh, my only friends. They're just decaying there in the corner."

116
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 He keeps umping. He keeps being an umpire until the age of 52. Fairly young. Very young man.

117
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 In the year 1914, he's 52 years old and he's being an umpire and it's like super hot and everyone's all sweaty and stuff like that. They're in Chicago.

118
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's supposed to be Windy City, but this day it was the Heady City. He's umping this game. He's like, "Oh, my gosh. I wish I sure was in the refrigerator unit of my old undertaker's office."

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "Oh, that would be a cool place." He's kicking back. He's kicking back with some lemonade. He has a body posed like a butler. Thank you, sir.

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 That would have been definitely prolonged his life because in 1914, he's umping this game in Chicago and he died of a heat stroke.

121
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 He died doing what he kind of loved being an umpire, but definitely died being part of an organization he loved, which would have been baseball or the sport that he loved.

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So this guy who was so bad at baseball, he was actually sentenced for fraud. Now, he's in the Hall of Fame. He's in the baseball Hall of Fame and his hometown of San Jose has a statue of him.

123
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 It would be awesome if the statue was in the county jail, the little statues behind bars, but probably not. They probably don't treat his statue like that.

124
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Here's the story of Jack Sheridan. I found that story very uplifting, despite the fact that that involves a lot of dead bodies and a man failing at his dreams.

125
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 But I think that's super important. I've met people who really, really want to be musicians, but they're not good musicians. However, they're good managers.

126
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And I always say, "Do that. Do that." I think there is an easy way to do that. I love to tell stories. And for years, I was trying to write fictional books, right? I was trying to write fiction.

127
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And while I've written a couple screenplays and things like that, this is more fitting for me. I still get to tell these stories.

128
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I still get to use my skills as a storyteller to take notes, to do research, right? Journalism background. I do research. I take my notes and then I translate those notes into a story for you.

129
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 So I think that sometimes you do. I was trying so hard to be a novelist, but I think this is far more fulfilling for me.

130
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Pays a lot, pays a lot less money, but I love it. And I love spending this time with you guys. So sometimes, and just keep that in mind as you go forward in life, sometimes the passion that you want, you may not be able to get that exact thing, but there might be a place right next to it.

131
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 There's all sorts of other routes into the industry you love. So I love this story about Jack Sheridan. I found it the other day and I'm glad I was able to share it with you on this Friday hot diggity day.

132
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carboner Cofter. We are leaving behind San Jose, California. We're waving goodbye to a statue.

133
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Why are those guys standing in the corner going, "Bye, bye Jack, bye!" as they watch the Carboner Cofter descend from the clouds above.

134
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Everyone, let's jump on board as hot diggity day takes us out of here. We're headed all the way out to Kelvin, Arizona.

135
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 The other day I made a comment on the show, which I totally believe. I say this all the time behind the scenes and I've said it maybe once or twice on the podcast. This podcast is not for casuals, right?

136
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 People who listen to Dead Rabbit Radio, they have a really wide knowledge base of paranormal stuff. That's why we don't cover like Stonehenge or the Bermuda Triangle or Roswell.

137
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 We've talked about those things in passing, but generally I believe when you're listening to this show you have had at least like a year, if not a couple decades really.

138
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You can be anywhere in between of researching this stuff yourself, reading Time Life books, watching Ancient Aliens, checking out YouTube videos, listening to other podcasts.

139
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So we don't talk about Bigfoot, we talk about Mormon Bigfoot or the time that Ed and Lorraine Warren telepathically communicated with Bigfoot, right? We find the more weird stories.

140
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes. What's interesting though is that that is how it tends to happen, right? You are a young kid, right?

141
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You're in your 20s or something and you start to look into this stuff and usually the first things you find are stories like Roswell, are stories like Whitley Stryber's Communion.

142
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Just you might come across a conspiracy theory about reptilians or grey aliens or something like that.

143
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So we have that, right? And that kind of informs our idea of what aliens are, UFOs are. A lot of people watch the X-Files. That was their first big introduction.

144
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 They were young, the X-Files was on, it's a really cool show. And so they already have a working background knowledge of what a UFO looks like and what a grey alien looks like and how they act in abductions, catamethalations, anal probes, all that stuff.

145
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 You have a basic working knowledge. And that's kind of how the culture filters things through.

146
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Imagine though if you are, you're not even into UFOology, right? You've never heard of Roswell, you've never had any experience with that stuff. And this is the very first UFO story you heard.

147
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 This is such a bizarre encounter that even I'm having trouble kind of classifying it.

148
00:18:43,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Let's take a look at this. It's October 1976. We're in Kelvin, Arizona, specifically the desert area surrounding Kelvin. It's noon. Out in this desert area there's these four guys and they have a hobby.

149
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 They love grabbing turquoise. They just hold it temporarily and they're like "hobby achieved" and they drop it. No, I think they also sell it. I don't think that they're just rubbing their bodies on a turquoise stone and then going home.

150
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 They're out there and they actually have uncovered a turquoise vein. So they got this big chunk of turquoise and they're like "we hit it boys, hobby achieved!" and they're like giving each other high fives and stuff like that.

151
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The one guy is rubbing his body on the turquoise vein and they're like "Mark, stop!"

152
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And that's when they see something flying through the sky. This is noon, right? Blue sky, couple clouds, sun right above their heads.

153
00:19:46,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 You couldn't ask for any better time to observe a UFO. But what they see flying through the sky is the desert.

154
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 They're looking at a chunk of the desert floating in the sky. And this chunk of desert, I almost imagine it if you use the cutout tool on like a paint shop program and you cut out a block of dirt and then moved it up into the sky.

155
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And they just go "I'm done. Teacher, do I get an A on this? This is my Photoshop project."

156
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They're watching a chunk of the desert, the sandy soil of Arizona fly through the sky.

157
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And then about a hundred yards away from where these men were. Well I assume at this point they've dropped their jaws and their equipment.

158
00:20:43,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They watch this chunk of desert fly down and it lands. A little ramp appears in this chunk of desert and a door opens up.

159
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Right now we're already looking at the way that this is talked about in UFOology. I got this from thinkaboutadox.com, one of my favorite websites for the show.

160
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 They got it from a book called UFOs over New Mexico, a true history of extraterrestrial encounters in the land of enchantment.

161
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Which has gotten great reviews online by the way. I recommend a lot of you guys checking it out. I do want to get a copy myself.

162
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 They go "This ship must have had some sort of cloaking technology at this point."

163
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 That it would. It's not that good, right? If you're going to have cloaking technology, maybe you're just a guess aliens.

164
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It's just a suggestion. Maybe cloak against the background that you're flying on.

165
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Don't be an image of the ocean, crystal blue water flying over the midnight skies of Moscow. Probably not a great idea.

166
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 If you're in the sky, maybe be a cloud. Maybe be the one thing that everyone just sees in the clouds.

167
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I've wondered, and I've said this on a past episode, I wonder how many clouds are actually UFOs.

168
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I'm not saying they all are. I'm not saying like 10% of them are. But if I was an alien ship, I would just disguise myself as a cloud constantly.

169
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 There's a carabare writing on me all the time. I'm like, "Get off, get off!" Got to chase him off with the broom.

170
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 The idea is that this is some sort of cloak. What terrible cloak, right? What a terrible disguise.

171
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 You're going to try to sneak your way into the White House, so your disguise is an upside-down butler.

172
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 You're just walking on your head. People are like, "What? Yeah, sure, you look human, and you're wearing human clothes,

173
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 but you're clearly floating too much as off the ground, and that's your head down there, and your legs are doing this weird walking motion.

174
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 You're under arrest." The ground lands, right? The ground lands, and this door opens up.

175
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 This little ramp comes down. This door opens up. That's not even a weirdo stuff. The croaking thing is just bizarre, but the doors open up.

176
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 The ramp comes down and outsteps two humans. Normal-looking human dudes wearing shorts and t-shirts.

177
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And after the two men step out of this vehicle, out comes two women, Earth women, right?

178
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Not sexy reptilian alien women, just regular, regular old boring Earth women.

179
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Two women step out of the vehicle and three human children.

180
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And the four witnesses, the four witnesses, are looking at this and going, "Wait, wait, what?"

181
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Like, you wouldn't be surprised if you saw this group at a Chuck E. Cheese, because that's totally normal.

182
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 You might not even be-- You wouldn't even be surprised if you saw them in the desert. You would just assume they were out here,

183
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 maybe trying to find your turquoise vein. You have to kill them before they find it.

184
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 But if you saw other humans just walking around in the desert, assuming that you're not in the middle of the Sahara,

185
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 it wouldn't be super surprising, but they came out of a piece of the desert that was previously floating in the sky.

186
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 These obviously aren't what we would consider human, even though they look like humans.

187
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Two men, two women, three kids. And then the two men walk back up onto the ship.

188
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And they bring out all of these things. They kept saying in the description, "It looked like it seemed like,"

189
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 but it's almost like they don't want to admit that this is what they actually pulled out.

190
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So they go, "It looked like this, but in reality, because it's so insane what's going on here."

191
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 The two men walk back out of this piece of the desert with a barbecue.

192
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 With a barbecue grill. And they set it up, and then the two women go in and they bring out a "cooler."

193
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Like some of you are going to throw your butt in, some of you are going to throw a couple sodas in for the kids and me.

194
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Because I don't drink beer. They bring out this cooler, and the men go back in and they bring out a table

195
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 and a couple metallic chairs, and the kids go in and get their toys.

196
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And they start to have a barbecue in the middle of the desert at noon.

197
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Floating piece of the dirt. That's where they got all their stuff. Again, if they were getting this stuff out of a station wagon,

198
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 we wouldn't be talking about it. But they didn't.

199
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 These, what only can be described as aliens, right, at this point, even though they look totally human or they act totally human,

200
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 they have stepped out of a vehicle beyond our understanding. Probably beyond their own if they can't get the camouflage technology to work right.

201
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And the two families, we can assume based on traditional family structure,

202
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 or sitting there eating this delicious barbecue food that smells all wafting over to the turquoise miners, they're like, "No, Jerry, don't go over there, don't go over there."

203
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 He's like floating, his nose is floating on the smells. What would you do, right?

204
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I mean, on any other thing, I probably would be like, "Hey buddy, I haven't seen you so long, give me some chicken."

205
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Yum, yum, yum. I've crashed. I've crashed so many barbecues in my life.

206
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But I don't think I would, I don't know if I would want to crash this one, I probably would.

207
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But I'd probably be slower, I'd probably be sneakier about it.

208
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 The four men are standing there and they don't know what to make of this,

209
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 because they just saw something that shouldn't exist and then it turned into something that totally exists.

210
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 A barbecue, a family barbecue. Kids are playing with toys, people are eating food.

211
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Delicious, it's fun. And the dudes don't know what to do.

212
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The four turquoise miners, I don't think they're like, "Let's leave them to their business gentlemen, we gotta mine this turquoise."

213
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 They're watching this, they have no idea what the world's going on.

214
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Till eventually from the picnic, from this little barbecue that's going on,

215
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 one of the men looks over at the turquoise miners, gets up and walks over there.

216
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 He walks over to them and he goes, "Hey guys, what's going on? What are you guys up to out here?"

217
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And the four dudes are just kind of looking at each other and they're like, "We're mining for turquoise."

218
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 That's what we do, you see we've uncovered this turquoise vein.

219
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And the man kind of shook his head and goes, "I'll never understand humans and their fascination with rocks."

220
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He turned around, walked back to the barbecue.

221
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And after a while, the family packed their stuff back up.

222
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Kids got their toys, ladies got the cooler, the men got the barbecue, the tables and the chairs,

223
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 and they all loaded this vehicle, this chunk of dirt that is just sitting there.

224
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 They all walked back up the ramp, the ramp disappeared, and the sand flew away.

225
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Now imagine if that was the very first, imagine if you are 10.

226
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And that was the very first UFO story you ever heard.

227
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 After that, when everyone was watching the next files, they were like, "Oh no, the season finale, I wonder if the vacationers are going to show up."

228
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And people were like, "What are you talking about? What vacationers?"

229
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 There's like a gray alien about to punch Skully in the back of the head.

230
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And then he's like, "All these gray aliens sure are cool, but where's the barbecue scene? Are they going to barbecue Skully?"

231
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And you've got some weird fetish right here talking about vacationers during next files.

232
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 This was the first UFO story you ever heard.

233
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 If you never really picked up on flying saucers, I think my first really forays into UFOs were

234
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 like, Leonard Nimoy's in search of, National Enquirer honestly, I think was a lot of the early UFO stuff for me,

235
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 because they'd have pictures of UFOs, and every so often you would catch something on television.

236
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But it was rare. I'm 46? How old am I? 45 I think right now?

237
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Going on 46 or maybe 47? I don't know, I forgot how old I am.

238
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But I'm in that age, 45, 46.

239
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 So you couldn't rent DVDs and stuff like that, you pick up books.

240
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 But that's when you go to buy the books after you like UFOs.

241
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I think my earliest introduction to UFOs were things like the National Enquirer.

242
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Every so often would have something on the cover about a UFO, and then eventually weekly world news and stuff like that.

243
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And all of that stuff was fake. Those were the first images I saw.

244
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 This is a disc. This is what an alien looks like, the probe and the anal probes and stuff like that.

245
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 If this was, if you're nine and this was the very first UFO story you heard, nothing else would make sense after it.

246
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Like if this was the formative UFO story, maybe you have heard the term flying saucer before.

247
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Maybe you have heard Roswell, but it didn't really interest you, you had no idea.

248
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 But then one day you sat down and read this, you'd be like, "What?"

249
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 You would think that this was the official, this is what they were all like.

250
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You go to a Star Wars and you're disappointed, you're like, "Ah, they totally saw the Death Star."

251
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I was expecting it to be a giant patch of dirt.

252
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 But nope, it was a mechanical super structure. These aren't real aliens.

253
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It would be super confusing. And that's what I kind of love about this story.

254
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And I want to wrap it up like this. This story just doesn't make any sense.

255
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 But it's interesting because we researched these other stories.

256
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 We talk about all these other stories and we go, "Oh, here's a really cool story about great aliens doing this."

257
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Because it follows the rules. We've been talking about this a lot this season.

258
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Like the rules of the paranormal and can the rules be broken and what happens when the rules are broken.

259
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 When it comes to UFO phenomenon, there are certain things that we expect.

260
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Dirt flying through the sky is not one of them.

261
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Full of a bunch of people on a vacation in khaki shorts and t-shirts is not one of them.

262
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And I love it. I'm not discounting this story. That's one of the things I like about it.

263
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I think sometimes we really do have to look at the anomalies.

264
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And I'm not saying like, "This story's fake because it doesn't have these 10 things we expect in UFO stories."

265
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 But to be fair, I'm sure there are other UFO researchers who do.

266
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And that's a bad look for the research, for the paranormal researchers and the UFO researchers.

267
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I do think you have to be open to all those things.

268
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 So how do you classify this story? It's a UFO story.

269
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 These are people from out of this world.

270
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 This could be a time slip. This could be some sort of alternate reality.

271
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 But the fact that he says, "I don't understand why you humans like rocks."

272
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It really makes it seem like these guys aren't human.

273
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And it could be that the technology we talk about this sometimes too,

274
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 that the technology or the phenomenon is so bizarre your brain can't process it.

275
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 So it makes you remember it in a way that is simple for you.

276
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 We know that happens with trauma, with real life trauma.

277
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Sometimes your brain goes, "I remember when I was actually going to get into an example.

278
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I don't want to get in an example of that."

279
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 But if you guys know where I'm going, where your brain makes up a story,

280
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 it just seems implausible at best.

281
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 So it's possible that this was some sort of high-tech star cruiser.

282
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 [imitates explosion]

283
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And out stepped Lord Dracor and his Dark Legion.

284
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And it was just these abominations from deep space.

285
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 They have a little grill there making turkey patties.

286
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And their brain just could not comprehend this cosmic horror.

287
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 They remember it as this bizarre story.

288
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 That's possible, but it's also possible that out of all the multitudes of alien races,

289
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 we have the grays, right?

290
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Maybe there's the khakis.

291
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Maybe there is a race of people out there who just love to wear khaki shorts

292
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 and have barbecues on other planets.

293
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 That's what they're into.

294
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 I love this story because it's so unusual, because it's so insane

295
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 that you have to wonder how do you classify it.

296
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But that's what's so cool about doing this podcast, is finding these things

297
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 and being able to share them too, right?

298
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 If I wasn't making this podcast, I wouldn't be just spending hours upon hours.

299
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I spend a lot of time, a lot of time in my week.

300
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 It's like 10, 20 hours a week just reading stuff for you guys.

301
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And then I get to find awesome stories like this.

302
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I've definitely put a smile on my face.

303
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Hopefully put a smile on your face.

304
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Now I've outed them.

305
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 I'm going to spark the human khaki war.

306
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 We're going to end up, well, we'll beat them.

307
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 We'll beat them.

308
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Obviously their ships have terrible cloaking technology.

309
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 They're like, sir, sir, I think we're being invaded.

310
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And we look and we just see these giant dirt clods flying through the blue sky.

311
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I think we can take them.

312
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 I think we can take the khakis.

313
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Or maybe we won't even fight them.

314
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Maybe we will have a delicious barbecue together.

315
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 The cosmic brotherhood finally united over hamburgers, baked beans, and ice cold Coca-Cola.

316
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Wouldn't that be a beautiful future for all of us?

317
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
