1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 A peaceful 4th of July night is interrupted by a demonic invader.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,180
 And then we take a look at the urban legend known as The Bunny Man.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,760
 Was there any truth to the story of a man in a bunny suit chasing people down with an

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,200
 axe today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:30,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,920
 Like usual, we got a lot to jump into, so we're gonna go ahead and get started here.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,440
 Our first story, just like yesterday's story, where I talked about the crazy guy who took

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,200
 a bunch of acid and allegedly he was running people over with his car, happened on the 4th

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 of July.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 America's birthday.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,760
 It's the one day everyone should just come together, throw fireworks at each other, start

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,440
 small fires and use the explosions that celebrate America's glory as cover for their gun-related

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
 crimes.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,880
 That's what 4th of July is for, not for these lunatics.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,560
 4th of July, 2019.

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,720
 There's this family, the Lewis family.

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,480
 They just moved into their new house in Chesterfield County, Virginia.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
 Brand new house.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,040
 America's birthday.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 House birthday.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,560
 A new family is born.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,160
 I mean, they had three kids.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,360
 They weren't just like, they weren't the Sims.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,560
 They weren't like moving into a house and then breeding the next day.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,200
 But this was their first night in a new house.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
 They all have a good time and everyone goes to bed.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 Except for the dad.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 He stays up late.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,080
 He stays up a little bit later than the rest of the family.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,000
 So at 10.30pm, the dad is still awake, putting around the house, going, "This is gonna be

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,200
 a good house.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,920
 I can raise a good family here."

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,680
 He's like touching the walls.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,040
 He's like gladiator.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,600
 He's like walking through the living room, touching the carpet with his fingertips.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
 He's like, "This is peace.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,640
 I found Elysium here."

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,000
 And then he hears [imitates sound of a car]

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,720
 Bunch of stuff getting knocked over in the basement.

43
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 It should be specific.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,080
 It wasn't like he turned around and there was a bunch of stuff knocked over in his house.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
 He heard some commotion in his basement.

46
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
 He's like, "The peace has been disturbed my new house."

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,800
 So he goes and he opens up the basement door.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,640
 What is it about basements that are intrinsically creepy?

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 Attics and basements.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,080
 I don't know if it's the fact that people aren't there very often or the fact that

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,360
 they're always featured in horror movies.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
 But if you were walking around your house and you heard like a loud noise kicking around

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,520
 in your living room, you'd be like, "Ugh."

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,680
 But you would do more than that, which you'd be like, "Oh no.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,840
 Someone's in my living room."

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
 And that would suck.

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
 I'm not downplaying that.

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,160
 But if you heard a noise bumping around in your basement, you'd think, "Demon."

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,840
 Then maybe burglar.

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,400
 You heard the noise in your living room, you'd probably go burglar.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
 But if you heard a bunch of thrashing around in your basement, you're grabbing the crucifix.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,920
 But anyway, so this dude, this dad, hears much of stuff knocking around in his basement.

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,480
 He's like, "That's weird."

64
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,640
 And so he opens the door and he sees a young woman.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,400
 Her name is Ryan Doss, a 29-year-old woman.

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,160
 And you're thinking, "Oh, it's just a break in story, a true crime story."

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 You don't know.

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 You didn't let me finish.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,360
 It's partially true crime.

70
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,400
 Anyways, this woman is completely nude.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 Don't get excited, guys.

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
 It's not going there.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Dad's like, "Mmm.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,640
 A little pretreat, a little birthday present from my new house.

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,920
 New woman's completely nude.

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
 Blue ponytail."

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 And the only reason I why I mention that is because every news report mentioned that.

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,120
 Now it's funny because I get like a lot of people don't like unusually dyed hair.

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,320
 But that's not the detail I would focus on so much.

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,280
 And every article I read about this, they always focus on three things.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,040
 One, she was naked, which is notable because most people don't appear naked in public.

82
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
 Two, she had a blue ponytail.

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
 What?

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
 Everyone.

85
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 It's not even registered.

86
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,000
 Third, her eyes were completely black.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 That's...

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 See?

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
 You thought it was true crime.

90
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,640
 Dude, you thought I was doing a home invasion story.

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,800
 You're like, "Man, no.

92
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,240
 This woman is knocking stuff over in the basement.

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,560
 And the father who wanted to remain unnamed.

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
 The mother, for some reason the wife was saying her name, but the dad's like, "I don't

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 want my name used."

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,400
 The dad standing up there, Maximus is standing up there.

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,680
 He's like, "You've disturbed my Elysium."

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,400
 Ryan Doss looks at but I'm like, "Shhh."

99
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,000
 Actually no, we actually have quotes of what they said.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,320
 She's thrashing around in the basement.

101
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,360
 She looks up at him and she says, "I need your help.

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
 Please help me."

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
 And he goes, "Get out of my house."

104
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,920
 And there's actual quotes.

105
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,800
 And then her response to that is, "I'm the devil."

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
 And then she starts laughing maniacally.

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,200
 So first Sheila was like pleading for him to help her to like come down the stairs and

108
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 help her out.

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,400
 And then once he's like, "Get the hell out of my house."

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,480
 She's like, "Oh, obviously that disguise didn't work.

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,080
 It comes to devil."

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,440
 And he says, "This is his description of her.

113
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
 She looked possessed.

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,840
 Her eyes were completely black like saucers and she was laughing like it was a joke."

115
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,320
 Now I don't think he meant they were black like saucers.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
 I think he meant they were biggest saucers and they left that word out of the quote.

117
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,360
 Or to be fair, I may not have typed that word out in his quote.

118
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,780
 But anyways, so she had big old black eyes, big old demonically possessed black eyes and

119
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,600
 she was laughing like it was a joke.

120
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,880
 The dad then goes and gets his gun.

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,440
 Now it's interesting to note that I'm, this is where the story gets a little weird and

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,460
 I actually was glad that I had a break because I was like, "I have to verify some stuff.

123
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,120
 Sometimes these stories you have to wait a while to see if they're true."

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,400
 There was that story about the guy who got frozen.

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 It was a recent story.

126
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
 A guy in Russia was like found frozen in a cave and the bear had like dragged him back

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,640
 there and was freezing him to use for food later.

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,800
 And I go, "That's not true.

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,960
 This is absolutely not true."

130
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 Was all over the internet.

131
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,440
 Turns out it wasn't true.

132
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,520
 That guy who looked like he suffered from horrible frostbite was actually suffering

133
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,800
 from like advanced psoriasis.

134
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 Story was completely fake.

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,240
 So if you guys were telling your buddies at work, "Oh, did you hear about that guy who

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,160
 got kidnapped by a bear and was like turned into a frozen meal?"

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
 No, that didn't happen.

138
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
 So anyways, some of these stories, when I read this, I was like, "This is interesting,

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
 but it doesn't sound real."

140
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,880
 This part doesn't sound real either.

141
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,200
 Dad gets his gun, warns her, "Hey, don't come up the stairs."

142
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,600
 And she's (laughs) walking up the stairs and then she charges him and he starts opening

143
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 fire.

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,940
 But that's all believable.

145
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,280
 That all makes sense.

146
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,240
 He fires 39 shots.

147
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,600
 So assuming this guy had a pistol, I don't think he came around the corner with a Tommy

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 gun.

149
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,960
 Assuming this guy had a pistol, he would have had to reload, what, four times?

150
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 And not a single bullet connected.

151
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,080
 Now he said, and now here's the reason why that sounds like a lot of bullets to do warning

152
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 shots.

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,200
 But news reporters have been out to the house.

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,240
 I was watching video footage.

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
 You do see the bullet holes in the wall.

156
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
 There's blood on the wall.

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,800
 Even though he didn't hit her, because what happens next is she runs up the stairs and

158
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,280
 they start fighting.

159
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,960
 And once they start fighting, this is again where you kick into the not your everyday home

160
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
 invasion.

161
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,080
 They start fighting and she said she was incredibly strong.

162
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,680
 Quote, "She had the strength of four grown men."

163
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,640
 So he's wrestling this woman and she's just large and in charge.

164
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,960
 She's actually quite skinny, but she's very, very strong.

165
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,720
 This wakes up his family.

166
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,160
 When he's wrestling with her, he begins hitting her with furniture.

167
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,720
 Almost I can imagine a loony tune.

168
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 He picks up an ottoman, that doesn't work.

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
 Picks up a chair, that doesn't work.

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
 Picks up a recliner, that doesn't work.

171
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
 And she's just shrugging all this stuff off.

172
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
 His family comes down.

173
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,320
 His wife and three kids come down.

174
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,480
 Full fight breaks out.

175
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,280
 This one woman against the family of five.

176
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,760
 And she's holding her own.

177
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
 And here is what the news article says.

178
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,880
 The intruder, the reason why I'm reading this quote, because I can't really make sense of

179
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 this.

180
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,600
 The intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the 12 year old son Logan, of course

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,000
 his name's Logan, shoved a wrench into her neck.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,760
 So I'm like, did he like hit her in the neck?

183
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,520
 Was it, did they mean screwdriver and put it in the neck?

184
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like how do you shove a wrench into someone's neck?

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,800
 I mean I guess you can and I guess it would be extremely painful.

186
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
 But that's what ended the fight.

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,200
 When Logan jumped into the fray, snick, but instead of claws, had two wrenches and just

188
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,840
 poked her really hard of the neck, actually did quite a lot of damage.

189
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,480
 The woman ended up getting like massive facial wounds from this wrench jab into the neck.

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,040
 She shoved a wrench into her neck.

191
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,960
 I'm not wrong in thinking that's a weird phrase, right?

192
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,000
 But anyways, shaw!

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
 Puts the wrench in her neck.

194
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
 He's like time to tighten this nut case.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,840
 Dad's like, eh, A for effort.

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,360
 But it doesn't really make sense.

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,520
 Woman's bleeding out.

198
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,920
 Woman's bleeding out everyone.

199
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
 She gets arrested.

200
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,880
 They're covered, the family's covered in bites and bruises and the woman who had to

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,240
 be treated for severe head trauma.

202
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,160
 What's really weird about, well everything's weird about the story.

203
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,280
 What I find odd about the story is one, it happened on 4th of July.

204
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,800
 I don't know why I find that weird.

205
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,960
 Two, they started getting, this family started getting harassed online because of this story.

206
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
 They actually don't live in the house right now.

207
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
 They said it's a horrible place to go to.

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 There's blood everywhere.

209
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
 You know, you can clean that up.

210
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,520
 But they're like, it's just horrible memories, our first night in the house and our entire

211
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,000
 family of five had to fight this demonically possessed woman.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,840
 But they're getting trolled online because of this story.

213
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,640
 So here's my, I'm glad everyone was okay and that Ryan woman's gonna, she's probably

214
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,360
 gonna probably, you know, do two years or something like that.

215
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,960
 I don't think it's gonna be a serious crime for her.

216
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,740
 But here's my ultra spooky conspiracy theory about this one.

217
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,760
 She was demonically possessed.

218
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
 She was sent there.

219
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
 Alleged!

220
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,600
 Before I start saying this, allegedly, I have no proof to back this up.

221
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,200
 This is just me being a phantast- a fabulous- I think that's another word for a liar.

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 But you know what I mean?

223
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
 Like, this is me extrapolating this out.

224
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 I'm not saying any of this is true.

225
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
 I just think it's an interesting theory.

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 No proof.

227
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 I'm not saying it's true.

228
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,360
 But, all that being said, she was demonically possessed and she was sent there to torment

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,160
 this family.

230
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,520
 She was sent there to torment the family.

231
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,480
 She didn't succeed in what she was supposed to do.

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,120
 And the people trolling this family online, making them feel unsafe, making them feel

233
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,520
 scared to the point where they're not- they're moving from location to location in the area

234
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,680
 are fellow demonically possessed people.

235
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,640
 Continuing her work to torment this family.

236
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,800
 I have no proof to back that up!

237
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,960
 I have no proof to back that up at all!

238
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,880
 So don't sue me, demonically possessed trolls, or family of five that beat up a demonically

239
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,120
 possessed woman.

240
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,560
 And maybe she wasn't demonically- the logical thing is she wasn't demonically possessed

241
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
 at all.

242
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,120
 You see a naked woman in your basement, she looks up at you and goes, "I need your help."

243
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
 And she has those black eyes.

244
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,880
 And it's funny, I'll do another episode on this in the future, but the story of the

245
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,440
 black eyed kids, that's a really big urban legend going on right now where kids show

246
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,320
 up at your door and they go, "Can you help us?"

247
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,280
 And their eyes are completely black.

248
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,400
 So I think it's interesting that you have that detail to this, where you have someone

249
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,440
 first asked for help and the guy notices she has completely black eyes.

250
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,840
 She attacks them, but this one's been completely verified by the police.

251
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,080
 The police didn't take a photograph and see that she had black eyes, but the woman is

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,400
 arrested, there's police records and photographs and news reports and everything like that

253
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
 that you can see online.

254
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,640
 So was this a case of a black eyed kid taking the next step, or a black eyed woman, taking

255
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,680
 the step of now actually breaking in your house rather than just trying to be invited

256
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 in?

257
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,200
 Is she the first step of a full on demonic invasion?

258
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,520
 And if you beat her back to her demonically possessed trolls, then harass you to continue

259
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,680
 her mission.

260
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,920
 Most likely not, but it's an interesting take on another wise terrible home invasion

261
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
 story.

262
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
 When she was afraid it wasn't the first place.

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,840
 Okay, so, but demons man, that makes it more than the average.

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,720
 It's more than the average home invasion.

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

266
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,160
 Now our next topic was actually a request.

267
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,200
 It was a request on Facebook from Merrick.

268
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,520
 And Merrick goes, "Hey man, talk about the Bunny Man."

269
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,600
 Now I had been researching the Bunny Man, thanks Merrick.

270
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,000
 I had been researching the Bunny Man before that, just because it's kind of an odd, it's

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,240
 an outlier when it comes to urban legends.

272
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,400
 Because it's true.

273
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,840
 It's verifiably true.

274
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,080
 But let's talk about who the Bunny Man is first.

275
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,960
 October 22nd, 1970.

276
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,720
 We're in Fairfax County, Virginia.

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,840
 And in Fairfax County, Virginia, there is Guinea Road.

278
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,240
 Richard Gears favorite road, that's an old joke.

279
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,760
 And not true actually, he did not stick a gerbil up his butt.

280
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,320
 But moving on from that, moving on from that.

281
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,240
 October 22nd, 1970.

282
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,440
 There's a young couple sitting in a car on Guinea Road.

283
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,960
 And it's Robert Bennett and his fiancee.

284
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,880
 Just sitting in this car late at night.

285
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,880
 Smooth, jazz playing, whatever they listen to in the 70s.

286
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,760
 You don't listen to disco while you're sitting in a car making out, I assume.

287
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,560
 You listen to something like sexy, right?

288
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
 Earth, wind and fire.

289
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,400
 So anyways, Robert Bennett and his fiancee are sitting in this car on Guinea Road.

290
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,280
 And they see something kind of in the bushes.

291
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,920
 Then you see the point of view from the Bunny Man.

292
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,480
 You see thermal vision of the couple in the car.

293
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,120
 You're looking through the Bunny Man's eyes.

294
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,080
 Anyways, this couple sitting in the car late at night, earth, wind and fire is playing.

295
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
 And this guy in a giant bunny suit starts walking towards the car.

296
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 Now that would startle anybody.

297
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,360
 If you were sitting in the middle of nowhere making out with your girl and you saw a man

298
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,520
 in a tuxedo come out of the bushes, that would startle you.

299
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,040
 So any other thing added to that would make it far more terrifying.

300
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,000
 Bunny suit coming out of the bushes.

301
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,600
 This dude though is also holding a hatchet.

302
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,680
 And he walks up to the car and he begins yelling, "You're on private property."

303
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480
 And he pulls his hand back to throw the hatchet.

304
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,400
 And then we freeze frame.

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
 Six years earlier.

306
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,760
 And I'll tell you that's the one thing that pisses me off about movies more than anything.

307
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
 No there's a lot of stuff that pisses me off about movies.

308
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,840
 But whenever you have a movie that shows an exciting scene and then goes 4 or 3 days earlier,

309
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,920
 8 hours earlier, whatever it is, you've lost almost all goodwill with me.

310
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,040
 It will take me a good 30-40 minutes for me to be like, "Okay, I hate it when..."

311
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,280
 If you're a writer, don't do that.

312
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,800
 It's one of the most irritating things as someone who reads books or watches movies.

313
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,760
 Especially it signals to me your story will not get exciting until we get to that point.

314
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,560
 It's super, super irritating.

315
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,200
 Anyways, having said that, I'm going to use that same gimmick for this.

316
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,520
 We were going back in time and in the 1960s, so 10 years earlier, there's an insane asylum

317
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,200
 in Fairfax County, Virginia.

318
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,720
 But it's being shut down on the stormiest night possible.

319
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,960
 Get in the crazy bus, guys.

320
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
 Get in the crazy bus.

321
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,240
 That's not an inmate.

322
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,520
 Just the guards pushing the crazy people with shotguns.

323
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,440
 Get in the bus, crazy local people.

324
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,320
 Throwing them in, the bus starts driving away.

325
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,440
 They're in a semi, apparently.

326
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,320
 They're running away from war pups.

327
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,240
 They're in a bus, driving through a rainstorm, and the bus loses control.

328
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
 The driver loses control of the bus.

329
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,880
 Bus skids off the road, blows up.

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080
 Two inmates escape.

331
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,000
 They're about to crawl out of the wreckage.

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,220
 Douglas Griffin and Marcus Wallster.

333
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,960
 And they're in the woods for a long time and nobody could find these guys.

334
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,560
 But what they did find was the guts and skins of rabbits they were eating.

335
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,100
 And eventually, over time, crazy people do what crazy people do, and Griffin ends up

336
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,120
 killing Wallster and hangs him from a local bridge.

337
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,000
 Now these guys were known as the Bunnymen because they found all these bunny carcasses

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 everywhere.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,760
 But now it's just the Bunnyman.

340
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 Griffin.

341
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,060
 Because Wallster is hung, they find his crazy body hanging from a crazy rope off a crazy

342
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
 bridge.

343
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:35,060
 The Bunnyman was never seen again, but now if you walk across what's known as Bunnyman

344
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,700
 Bridge, you will get killed by the ghost of Douglas Griffin.

345
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,860
 An interesting story, an urban legend that went around Fairfax County for a long, long

346
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
 time.

347
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,140
 But, let's move on.

348
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,500
 There was an urban legend in Fairfax County, Virginia.

349
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,760
 I have a teenager who bought a bunny suit.

350
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,400
 He loved wearing his bunny suit, wore it everywhere.

351
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
 Very, very, the original furry.

352
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,000
 He is the cane and able, he's both of those dudes, of the furries.

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,440
 I wonder how long ago furries existed.

354
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,080
 Like I remember, it was funny, I remember watching like DuckTales and all that stuff.

355
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 I've talked about that stuff.

356
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,960
 And I remember one day I was watching, it might have even been Rescue Ranges, which

357
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,200
 was my least favorite thing.

358
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,500
 But I remember watching all these shows growing up, or I was older at this point, I was a

359
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,940
 junior or senior in high school.

360
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,660
 They had all these characters.

361
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,460
 Now there was no sexy ducks on DuckTales.

362
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,860
 There were no real sexy characters on, like, Tailspin or Darkwing Duck, or definitely

363
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,620
 not Gummy Bearish, but I remember, like, Rescue Rangers, I think Gadget was supposed to be

364
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,700
 kind of like shapely and stuff like that.

365
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
 The woman in Tailspin looked like a mom.

366
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,400
 Which I mean, no offense to moms, but anyways, you know what I mean?

367
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,840
 Like, the female animals began to get more and more shapely as time went on.

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,920
 And I remember thinking, before I even knew anything about furries, I remember thinking,

369
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,600
 people are going to start wanting to bang these things.

370
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 Not me.

371
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,960
 Not me, that wasn't like an innate desire.

372
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,320
 But I remember thinking, these characters are getting to be drawn far more curvier.

373
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,720
 People are going to want to bang these things someday.

374
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,340
 And so, when I started hearing about furries, I wasn't shocked at all.

375
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,540
 Like, oh, that's an outgrowth, I think, of the media that we consume.

376
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,420
 Is where your fetishes can come from.

377
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,580
 Definitely.

378
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,420
 So anyways, where was I going with this?

379
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,940
 Oh yeah, I wonder who the first furry, like, not who the first furry was, it was just like

380
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,100
 this count Dracula of furries that lived up in a map.

381
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,140
 I wonder when that started.

382
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,340
 I would assume, and again, I would assume it did not exist.

383
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,160
 Furries, I assume it did not exist before Walt Disney cartoons.

384
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 I think that was the start of it.

385
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
 I don't think anyone ever thought about dressing up as a wolf or a duck.

386
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,640
 I mean, shamans and stuff like that, like medicinal practitioners, shapeshifters.

387
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,040
 But the idea of putting on a costume as a giant duck or porcupine or whatever and walking

388
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,520
 around like banging other porcupines, I don't think that happened before Disney.

389
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,460
 Which is interesting because how many other fetishes can we really point to, like an origin?

390
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,020
 Like a hair fetish is just when people stopped, like, people were evolving out of monkeys

391
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,060
 and they're like, man, I wish I missed all that hair.

392
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,220
 You know, actually hair fetishes, okay, I'll finish this slide.

393
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,060
 Hair fetish is actually considered one of the most common fetishes possible.

394
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,540
 So anyways, that all being said, that all being said, totally off track.

395
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,580
 We have the story of the two inmates escaping from the insane asylum.

396
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,240
 Is that the origin of the Bunny Man legend?

397
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
 Let's go ahead.

398
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
 I have to restart this whole part.

399
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 Let's go ahead.

400
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,120
 A couple years later, there was a story of a teenager in Fairfax County, Virginia.

401
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
 He gets a bunny suit.

402
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,240
 You're like, Jason, I already heard this part, but I don't remember what I said.

403
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,440
 So I have to say it again.

404
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,600
 He gets a bunny suit.

405
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,520
 He wears it all the time.

406
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
 He totally loves it.

407
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,360
 And then he picks up an axe one day and just bashes all of it.

408
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 What didn't bash him?

409
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,000
 He cut his family of pieces.

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Baste him up.

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,100
 Now you go, Jason, you don't have to make sound effects when it comes to a family murder.

412
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,740
 But I guess I should say this right now.

413
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,420
 The Bunny Man bridge story is 100% not true.

414
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,700
 It is pure urban legend.

415
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,540
 There was no insane asylum in Fairfax County, Virginia.

416
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,380
 There was no two escaped inmates.

417
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,740
 Douglas Griffith and Marcus Walster never existed.

418
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,740
 Blah, blah, blah, blah.

419
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,100
 And you're like, well, that's kind of a buzzkill, but I want to lay this out because there are

420
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,620
 details of it that are true.

421
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,920
 So we have the story of the teenage getting the bunny suit, mashing his family up, making

422
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
 horrible sound effects as he doesn't.

423
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,200
 He goes to the Bunny Man bridge.

424
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,120
 Again, it was just called bridge at that point.

425
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,800
 Kills himself, hangs him specifically.

426
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,480
 And then as a ghost kills people on that bridge, but this one doesn't just kill people on the

427
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
 bridge.

428
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
 He kills people using an axe.

429
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,040
 And then there's another version of this urban legend of a man in a bunny suit in Fairfax

430
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:07,260
 County, Virginia carrying an axe commits vandalism all over town and he's never ever caught.

431
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,860
 And you think, well, that's a weird de-escalation.

432
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,020
 The first one we have two escaped inmates eating rabbits on the run, rebels without a cause

433
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,340
 or without any sanity.

434
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,900
 One ends up killing the other and that murderer now is a ghost who kills people on Bunny Man

435
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,100
 Bridge.

436
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,700
 And then the next one makes it creepier.

437
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,760
 Now it's just some teenager who snapped in a bunny suit again, makes it creepier, kills

438
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,640
 himself on the same bridge and now kills you with an axe.

439
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,160
 Third one's just a guy running around with an axe committing petty vandalism.

440
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,160
 But the reason why there's a de-escalation there is because the third one is closest to

441
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
 the truth.

442
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,160
 The truth of the matter is Fairfax County, Virginia does have or did have and may still

443
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,400
 have a Bunny Man problem.

444
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,060
 Let's go back to our story how we started this off.

445
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,540
 October 22nd, 1970, Robert Bennett, his fiance, and Earth Wind and Fire hanging out in this

446
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,580
 car, the guy in the bunny suit comes out with the hatchet and says, you're on private property.

447
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,740
 He takes the hatchet, throws it out of the car, it breaks a window, the couple drives

448
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
 off.

449
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,140
 They go to the police station and they say, some guy in a bunny suit just came out of

450
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,300
 nowhere and threw a hatchet at us and of course the cops are looking at these people

451
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,200
 and being like, that's the dumbest thing we've heard all night.

452
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,480
 But they take him outside and they show the police there's damage to the car, there's

453
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,000
 a hatchet in the back seat, windows busted and the kids are like, listen this really

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,960
 happened, I'm not gonna fake this, my girlfriend's terrified, I'm not getting any tonight.

455
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 Unless, he goes and buys a bunny suit, the police put it in their report and they're

456
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,960
 like, it's probably just a prank.

457
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
 What?

458
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
 Okay.

459
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,360
 Not a lot of pranks involve flying hatchets.

460
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,520
 But that is 100% true.

461
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
 That story actually happened.

462
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,500
 And what happens is, there was a guy, his name was Brian Connelly, he was a historian

463
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,060
 slash archivist for the Fairfax County Public Library.

464
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,100
 And what happened was he was getting requests because a long time ago there was creepypasta

465
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,420
 flying around about the bunny man of Fairfax County, Virginia.

466
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,900
 And he's sitting there in his library doing nerd stuff and every show often he'd get

467
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,740
 an email being like, I'm a paranormal investigator and I want to find out more about this bunny

468
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
 man.

469
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
 Is there really a ghost on Bunny Man Bridge?

470
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,760
 And he'd be like, what?

471
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,840
 And he kept getting emails.

472
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,600
 I heard a teenager killed his family and with wearing a bunny man suit.

473
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 And he's like, what?

474
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,080
 He got so many of these emails, he thought there has to be a reason.

475
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,840
 He was able to track down the creepypasta and he read it.

476
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,360
 He goes, there has to be a reason why these stories are originating here.

477
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,680
 So he started digging into all the records and he goes, I looked at all the mass murders

478
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,960
 at Fairfax County, Virginia, going back like 100 years.

479
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,400
 And he goes, there's only five that really would be considered a mass murder.

480
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,140
 And he detailed those a bit and there were terrible stories of stories of families getting

481
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,260
 slaughtered, but it was like some stranger came into town or some guy canaps a girl kills

482
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
 or stuff like that.

483
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,860
 He goes, so that didn't really fit with what we know of the bunny man legend.

484
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,100
 And he goes, I started, so there was no insane asylum.

485
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
 Those two people didn't exist.

486
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,580
 He's the one who did a lot of the research for this stuff.

487
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,540
 He goes, there was no mass slaughter by a teenager.

488
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,180
 He goes, but the third version of the story was kind of odd.

489
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,240
 And he ended up finding an article or a series of articles in the Washington Post that came

490
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,760
 out in 1970 telling the story, the true story of the bunny man.

491
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,080
 There was a man in a bunny suit who was walking around Fairfax County, Virginia.

492
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,520
 That's 100% correct.

493
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,400
 He carried hatchets or axes with him, throws them at people.

494
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
 And at one point he was just, he was smashing a house.

495
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,840
 He was there was a house that had like the support beams holding up the roof over the

496
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,960
 porch.

497
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,340
 And he's standing out in this house in this brand new subdivision.

498
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,300
 And the security guard for the subdivision is kind of driving around and sees a guy

499
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,620
 in a giant bunny suit standing there in the middle of the night.

500
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,180
 He pulls up and he goes, Hey, what are you doing, son?

501
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 What are you doing?

502
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,380
 Bunny man looks at him and then takes an axe and starts chopping at the support beams of

503
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
 the house.

504
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,260
 And he goes, you got to get out of here.

505
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,380
 These are his exact quotes.

506
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,500
 He goes, all you people trespass here.

507
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,780
 If you don't get out of here, I'm going to bust you on the head.

508
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,160
 And the whole time he's just smashing this house open with his axe, security guard just

509
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,960
 kind of looked at him, walked back to his car, got his gun and then turns around and

510
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,120
 the bunny man's running into the woods.

511
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,240
 So that guy also reported him to the police.

512
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,000
 At this point the police are looking for a, they're actively looking for a man in a bunny

513
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 outfit.

514
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,200
 The security guard said, this was my take from the sound of his voice.

515
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
 He was a teen, he was a white kid.

516
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 He was a teenager.

517
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,640
 He was a tall, lanky dude in a big bunny outfit.

518
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,200
 Police start looking for him.

519
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,180
 He calls up the owner of the subdivision calling himself the axe man.

520
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,060
 So he didn't go by bunny man because that's kind of a lame name.

521
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,380
 This guy went by the axe man.

522
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:53,500
 He calls up and he said, you have been messing up my property by dumping tree stumps, limbs

523
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,020
 and brush and other things on the property.

524
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:04,780
 You can make everything right by meeting me tonight and talking about the situation.

525
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,640
 And they also said on the phone that when the owner of the subdivision, the people who

526
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,880
 got that call said he sounded like a, he late teens, early 20s sound like a white guy.

527
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,720
 And obviously they didn't go to meet a lunatic with an axe in a bunny suit at an undisclosed

528
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,280
 location but the cops did.

529
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 He never showed up.

530
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,880
 And that is how the true police reported story of the bunny man saga ends.

531
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,900
 You had a man on a rampage in a bunny suit wielding weapons, attacking people who he

532
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,820
 thought were trespassing or littering on his property.

533
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,060
 Was he an eco terrorist?

534
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,620
 Was he a man who had some property that he saw that civilization was pushing too far

535
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,020
 into and decided to strike back?

536
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,100
 Both of those are possible.

537
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,900
 They may be the exact same thing.

538
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,380
 But what's interesting is where did he get the bunny man suit?

539
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,280
 But the fact is that he was never caught and he went on living with his life unless he got

540
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,760
 attacked by a bear, a giant man in a bear suit, attacked him and ate him.

541
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,880
 But that's the true version of the story of the bunny man who really did exist.

542
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,560
 What I think is interesting is you had that story happen in 1970 and it appeared people

543
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
 in town were talking about it.

544
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
 The police were looking for this guy.

545
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,840
 Washington posted articles on him.

546
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,600
 But as time passed, people began retelling that story and making it more creepy, more

547
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,660
 exciting, more dark and most importantly with almost no motive.

548
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,780
 The other two stories, the insane people are insane, they don't have a motive.

549
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,820
 And the second one, the teenager just snaps and kills as much people as he runs off the

550
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
 woods.

551
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,980
 Having a motive does make things less scary.

552
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,540
 Because it makes things make sense.

553
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,140
 You may not agree with the motive, but you go "well that guy was just had a terrible

554
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,340
 motive."

555
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,580
 The truth of the matter is someone was walking around Fairfax County in a bunny outfit with

556
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
 an axe.

557
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,040
 And that's an odd detail to build off of.

558
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,480
 If you're going to build an urban legend off of anything, that's a good one to pick.

559
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,840
 But even with everything being explained and having a nice little bow on it, we still don't

560
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,560
 know the identity of the bunny man.

561
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,480
 And we could say he just had these few encounters wearing the bunny man suit and he had problems

562
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,880
 with people being on his property and he ended up finding another hobby or got drunk and

563
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,260
 fell down into the river or just stopped being a lunatic in a bunny outfit.

564
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,420
 But there's always the possibility that when people in this county forgot he existed and

565
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,980
 began making up crazy stories about a different person named the bunny man, there's always

566
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,380
 a possibility that the bunny man simply went to another location, went to another community.

567
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,940
 And his crimes in those other areas also got lost through the mist of time.

568
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,580
 You'd think you would remember a man in a bunny suit carrying an axe, but this entire

569
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,660
 town forgot he even existed.

570
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,980
 They just remembered the name "bunny man" and then had to invent backstories to explain

571
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,320
 what that word meant.

572
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,640
 So who's not to say that this hatchet-wielding bunny man's reign of terror didn't continue

573
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,080
 throughout America?

574
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,480
 Who's to say that if this guy was a teenager in 1970s, he would still be alive today?

575
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,420
 And who's to say that in the darkness as you're driving down that road, coming home

576
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:27,640
 from work or school, and as you drive down those dark roads that separate the places

577
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,820
 where you feel comfortable, the places where you feel safe, if you see something on the

578
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,380
 side of the road, don't stop.

579
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,360
 Just keep going.

580
00:29:39,360 --> 00:30:05,560
 You might be curious, but your curiosity may turn you into the next urban legend.

581
