1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 When a little boy is spotted walking down an Australian highway in the middle of the

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,200
 night, passerby quickly inform the police that should have been the end of the story.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,000
 Instead, it was the beginning of a mystery.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,480
 Then we take a look at the story of a young woman whose favorite pastime was swimming in

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,880
 her family's pool.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,880
 Or was it?

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,120
 And finally we take a look at the theory that the sun, the big flaming ball in the sky that

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,560
 gives us light and life, may actually be an eldricked god that can destroy us at any moment

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:48,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,720
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out in the sun, but not the sun.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,120
 We'll be talking about it a little bit later.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,760
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters walking into

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,640
 Dead Rabbit Command right now.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
 Give it up for Radar.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,640
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Radar.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,480
 Radar, you're going to be our captain.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 That was a radar sound.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
 If you didn't pick up on that right.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,080
 Radar, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
 If you guys can't support the Patreon and totally understand, just helps to read the

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
 word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,120
 We also have a merch store and we have an Amazon wish list if you would like to buy

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
 me a book.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,640
 So really the main thing you can do is tell people about the show, get them listening

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 to the show.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,480
 It really, really means a lot when you do that.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,720
 Radar, let's go ahead and strap you into the hair hang glider.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,120
 We're going to take a nice leisurely glide all the way from Dead Rabbit Command out

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:48,240
 to Bardia, Australia.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,920
 Following those trade winds over the Pacific Ocean.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,560
 Specifically we're headed to the Hume Highway.

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,600
 This runs by Bardia, Australia.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,040
 It's April 18th, 2021, 7.40 PM.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,640
 [Mimics car noises]

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
 Cars driving down the freeway.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,720
 And in one of these cars is a man and his mom.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,400
 The dude's name is Mitch Cooney.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,880
 And Mitch Cooney is the owner of a motorcycle accessory shop called Shark Leathers.

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,320
 This is where we're not being sponsored by this company.

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,360
 But he's driving down the road and he has this like RV type thing on the back of his

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
 truck.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,560
 He's hauling this merchandise, hauling these supplies.

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,840
 Down the road and he has a little dash cam on his car.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
 This video is in the show notes.

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 You can watch it.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 I watched it a bunch of times.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,200
 This is a really interesting story for two reasons.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,760
 First off, what he captures on the dash cam.

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,920
 So Mitch is driving down the road with this truck hauling this load of supplies and this

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
 RV.

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,040
 And Clara's Day, well not Clara's Day, it's at night, but in the dash cam video as he's

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,400
 driving on the road, you see coming from the left hand of the screen a little kid.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,120
 Well a little something like this.

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,400
 Okay, it's something moving across the street, walking into the frame.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,520
 It looks like a young kid around age of six wearing a blue jacket.

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,080
 And it's a really busy highway.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
 It's late at night.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,320
 Well, it's not super late.

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,680
 It's 740, but it's very, very dark out.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,560
 And Mitch sees this kid and there's that initial instinct to stop and rescue the dude, but

65
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,360
 he realized the speed they were going with this toy hauler on the back of his truck.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 He stopped.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 He would have caused a huge accident.

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,360
 He drove by the kid and this is all caught on video.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,480
 The kid's very, very close to the car and his mom starts calling the authorities.

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 So at 741, she places this phone call.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,040
 As an anomalous video, right?

72
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
 We see videos like this all the time.

73
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
 I have also videos in the show notes.

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,240
 There's a woman who's laying in her bed and you see the sheet disappear like the aliens

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,480
 abducted her.

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,920
 There's a video also in the show notes of a fairy, a little fairy person setting off

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,800
 a motion detector.

78
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,280
 Videos are really hard to cover on a podcast obviously, because I can kind of tell you

79
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,040
 what happens and then we can kind of debate whether or not it's actually a fairy or a

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,600
 moth with legs or some sort of artifact blur, all that stuff.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,160
 It's really hard to do into the podcast.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,080
 So normally I would just say this is an interesting video.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,840
 I'd post it on a couple subreddits, post it in the Discord and that would be that.

84
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,800
 But the second part of the story is what makes this even creepier?

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,920
 Because then you could go, well maybe with some garbage, some garbage in the shape of

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
 a boy.

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,960
 It could be our imagination, it could be a trickle light or something like that.

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,640
 What makes this story interesting beyond the fact that there's this little boy walking

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,920
 down the highway is his mom calls at 741.

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,440
 They call the police and say, "Hey, we just saw a little kid down the road."

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,160
 At 829, Mitch calls the police again and it's like, because he can't get it off of his

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 head, right?

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
 Like, "I hope that little kid's okay."

94
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,720
 I mean, wouldn't that be so terrifying?

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
 "I hope that little kid's okay."

96
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
 Like, "I can't even imagine what could happen to that kid."

97
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,920
 "Well, I can imagine it, but I don't want to.

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
 It would be horrible."

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,360
 So at 829, Mitch calls the police again and says, "Hey, you know, just letting you know

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
 if you guys had any more news about that kid and I have dashcam footage."

101
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,320
 Like, if anything I can help, like if you need to see this footage of this little boy

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,600
 in case you need to know what type of jacket he was wearing.

103
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,000
 And he's talking to the police and they go, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we found the kid,

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 actually.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,120
 We sent units out there and we did locate the child.

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
 Don't worry.

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,320
 It's on its way back home.

108
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
 Everything's taken care of."

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,840
 Mitch is like, "Oh, that's awesome."

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,160
 This whole phone call lasted 44 seconds.

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,580
 What happened was a couple days later, a day later or two, the newspaper covered this story

112
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,160
 because he posted this on his Facebook, this video on his Facebook, and it went viral in

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,280
 the country.

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,080
 And the Daily Mail Australia covered this and they did a follow up on it as well.

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
 And when they asked the police, "Oh, so you went out there and you found the kid?"

116
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 The police go, "What?

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
 No.

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
 No, we didn't."

119
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,680
 Unfortunately, you didn't find the kid?

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
 No, no, no, no, we didn't find the kid.

121
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
 In fact, we actually sent units out there and we were looking for him till about 3.45 in

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 the morning.

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,560
 We checked the entire area where this guy said he saw a kid and no one.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,500
 We didn't pick up any kid.

125
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,640
 So now, Mitch is saying, "No, no, no, no, no, you told me you picked up the kid."

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,120
 I called a little less than an hour after it was all going down and you guys said that

127
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,120
 you picked up the kid and I shouldn't worry and the kid was on its way home and now you're

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,040
 telling me you were still searching the area until 3.45.

129
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,760
 And the police department's official answer was, "We never told you that we found the

130
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,840
 kid."

131
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,580
 So this is, that's what makes this story super weird, right?

132
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,760
 Because now we have the local authorities giving two different versions.

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800
 One of them is a lie.

134
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
 One of these stories is not true.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,320
 Either the officer who first picked up the phone, maybe it was not necessarily a malicious

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,960
 lie, maybe they were mistaken by saying we already picked up the kid and the kid's on

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,720
 the way home, but why would they still, I mean, that cop should be fired, right?

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
 If he revealed this information and it was flat or not true, there were still officers

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
 in the scene, at the scene until 3.45.

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,180
 So what went on here?

141
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,620
 This could have easily just been, here's weird footage of something and we don't know what

142
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,180
 it is and I see weird footage like that all the time.

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,220
 It's fun to look at that footage, but you can't really talk about it on a podcast.

144
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,420
 And most of the time you watch this footage and you go, "That's probably fake."

145
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,100
 This footage, you could have said, "Eh, it might be a kid.

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
 It might be fake.

147
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
 It might be a ghost.

148
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,220
 It could be all sorts of stuff.

149
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,700
 It could be a bag blowing in the wind."

150
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,880
 So the fact that the police said we found the kid, everything's okay, and then the next

151
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,880
 time they're asked by a reporter what happened, they go, "We didn't find a kid.

152
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,440
 We never saw a kid and we never told Mitch that we found a kid."

153
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,360
 Now that's a weird mystery, isn't it?

154
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
 Right?

155
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
 That's so weird.

156
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,480
 Which version is true?

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,800
 Creepy, creepy.

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,880
 I do think, looking at this video, again, I don't know, there's something in the road.

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
 Ghost kid?

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,100
 Ghost kid?

161
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
 Who knows?

162
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
 I don't think it's a bag.

163
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,820
 I don't think the person purposely faked it.

164
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,180
 But whether or not what's in the video is in the video, what's really weird is the police

165
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,740
 telling a lie either way.

166
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,540
 Either they found the kid and the kid was taken back home or they never found the kid.

167
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,140
 And then you start thinking like, could the kid have escaped from somewhere and the police

168
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,220
 are in on this weird conspiracy and they returned the kid to the kid.

169
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,760
 You know, now your mind can go wild.

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
 It's always the lack of information.

171
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,160
 But actually, you know, it's even worse than that.

172
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,800
 It's not necessarily a lack of information that drives the conspiracy theories.

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,160
 It's the false information.

174
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,280
 When someone tells you something that is not true, even if it's a little lie, it makes

175
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,040
 you suspect of the rest of the story.

176
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,000
 So yeah, that's where mind-mind started to go.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,880
 Like maybe they were in on something.

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
 I don't know.

179
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,840
 I don't want to accuse the entire police force of Australia to be in on this conspiracy,

180
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,460
 but yeah, really interesting, creepy story.

181
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,100
 I mean, the best case scenario is the cop was mistaken in that first phone call and

182
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,060
 they never did find the kid.

183
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,260
 But the other alternative is, oh, they found the kid and the kid wasn't taken back home.

184
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,340
 Once the reporter started wanting to know where the kid was, they're like, oh, we never

185
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
 found the kid.

186
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,660
 Creepy story, terrifying story, whichever way you cut it.

187
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,500
 Ghost kid, police corruption, very, very interesting.

188
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,580
 And you can watch that video in the show notes.

189
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,000
 I think in a video, I don't know if I have time to do this fully, but there's a YouTube

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,400
 channel I watch a lot called Corridor Crew.

191
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,200
 They do special effects.

192
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,160
 And I talked about them before because they did one where they were debunking like the

193
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,960
 Tic Tac video, the very famous UFO video that came out of the 2017 Nimitz Battle Cruiser

194
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
 thing.

195
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,280
 I think we're all familiar with the Tic Tac video.

196
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,800
 They recently did another breakdown.

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,980
 They were sent a video of a UFO and what a cool, I love the aspect of investigation.

198
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,380
 Like if someone's really putting their heart into an investigation, even if it proves something,

199
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,780
 even if it proves that the ghost is fake or the UFO was fake, to watch experts in their

200
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,740
 field watch this video and go, how would, is this real?

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,860
 Is this a real UFO?

202
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
 How would we do this?

203
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
 It's really cool.

204
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
 I'll put that in the show notes.

205
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
 I had a lot of fun watching that.

206
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,860
 It was a great little mystery.

207
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,260
 These guys are really enthusiastic about their art, their craft, which is special effects.

208
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,240
 So yeah, I'll put that in the show notes too, but a lot of times, you know, video stuff

209
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,720
 obviously doesn't translate well to podcasts, but I thought this story definitely did because

210
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
 the story that happened behind it, right?

211
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,160
 That's the spooky part.

212
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,760
 Radar, let's go ahead and leave behind Australia.

213
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,680
 We're going to hop on board the dead rabbit robot and we're going to row all the way back

214
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
 out to...

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
 Wait, never mind.

216
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,260
 We're also takes place in Australia.

217
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,780
 Radar, give me that robot.

218
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,020
 We're going to touch the keys to the dead rabbit dune buggy.

219
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,340
 We're leaving behind this highway.

220
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:04,100
 We're headed all the way out to a small neighborhood in Australia.

221
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,420
 Kicking up dust with that dead rabbit dune buggy.

222
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,660
 We should make toys of these.

223
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,380
 We shouldn't we have like a little Mattel hot, hot wheels set of like the dirgible and

224
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
 the...

225
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,780
 Jamie, go ahead and call Mattel and get them on that.

226
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,480
 We'll make a merchandise deal.

227
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,080
 Dead rabbit radio action figures with me and a little Miley Cyrus action figure, Mungo

228
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
 Jr.

229
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
 We get them all.

230
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 We get all those action figures.

231
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,320
 Radar, I want you to stop the dead rabbit dune buggy right here.

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
 We're going to hop out.

233
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,080
 We're standing outside the house of a young woman.

234
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,560
 Online, she's named Amelia6661.

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,880
 So we're just going to call her Amelia.

236
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,440
 That's perfect.

237
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
 And she tells us this story.

238
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,020
 Back in 2004, Amelia was only three years old.

239
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,980
 And that's when her family, her mother, her father and four other siblings moved to Australia.

240
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,820
 And she says they moved into a nice middle class house and a nice little middle class

241
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
 neighborhood.

242
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,420
 And this house came with a big backyard.

243
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,820
 That's always the greatest thing right for kids to have one of these big backyards.

244
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,580
 And the family decided, I'm sure everyone, I'm sure this was a unanimous decision, let's

245
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,520
 use part of this big backyard to put a pool in.

246
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,440
 So you guys are officially going to be the coolest kids in the neighborhood.

247
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
 We're going to have a pool.

248
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,320
 So they put in this giant pool in the backyard.

249
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
 They have a big trampoline and they do become the coolest kids in the neighborhood.

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,920
 All the kids want to come over to the new kid's house.

251
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,640
 Not just because they're the new kids, but because they have this big pool.

252
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
 And Amelia, this was her childhood.

253
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,040
 She goes, every weekend we were in the pool, friends would come over.

254
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,800
 We'd go into the pool.

255
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
 We'd have parties.

256
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,060
 When the anniversary party wasn't in sight, it was a pool party.

257
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,020
 This was her entire childhood.

258
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,180
 And so life goes on for Amelia and her pool until 2012.

259
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,740
 So eight years have passed since she's moved in here and 11 year old Amelia is running

260
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,260
 around her house and her two older sisters were like, hey, you know what, let's go to

261
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
 the pool.

262
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,660
 This is something that they say all the time.

263
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,140
 Who doesn't want to go into this pool?

264
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,980
 Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

265
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,800
 So Amelia runs into her bedroom and she puts on her bathing suit and she walks out and

266
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,960
 her dad is sitting there in the living room and Amelia walks in the living room and she

267
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,120
 goes, hey dad, we're going to go out to the pool and her dad kind of looks at her and

268
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
 goes, okay.

269
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,400
 She says he just said it very sarcastically.

270
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,880
 She didn't really click anything, right?

271
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,960
 And she's sitting there in the living room.

272
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,860
 She's waiting for her sisters to come out in their bathing suit so they can jump in

273
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,260
 the pool as well.

274
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,660
 And she says I was sitting in the living room for about 20 minutes.

275
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,540
 Like what is taking my sister so long?

276
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
 We've got to go swimming.

277
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,780
 If not now, when?

278
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,700
 We have to go swimming.

279
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,100
 And she goes, I got up and I went to one of my sister's rooms.

280
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,980
 Hey, are you coming?

281
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,700
 Are you coming out?

282
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,500
 And her sister opens the door and goes, where?

283
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 Going where?

284
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,880
 And Amelia goes to the pool.

285
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,800
 The sister just kind of looks at her.

286
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,840
 Amelia turns away from her sister.

287
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,880
 You have to imagine her stomach must have just been bunched up at this point.

288
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,720
 Something's not right.

289
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,680
 She feels it.

290
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,160
 And while she's wearing her bathing suit that she had just put on to go into the pool, she

291
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,380
 walks through the house, walks into the backyard.

292
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,220
 There's no pool.

293
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,980
 She said there were no photos of all these birthday parties at the pool.

294
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,420
 No pool toys laying around.

295
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,860
 No one else in the house had any clue what she was talking about.

296
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,240
 When she stood there and looked out into the backyard, it looked exactly like it did when

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,720
 they moved in eight years previous.

298
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,980
 She immediately got very upset and she was just confused.

299
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,680
 She could not understand what happened.

300
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
 And here she is.

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,040
 She just recently posted this a couple of weeks ago.

302
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,020
 She goes, it's been 10 years since that happened.

303
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,080
 And I still cannot figure out what in the...

304
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,560
 I just can't wrap my head around it.

305
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,900
 I know.

306
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,420
 I know.

307
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,580
 We had a pool for eight years at that house.

308
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,660
 It's funny when we talk about Mandela Effect, when we talk about reality warping and things

309
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,020
 getting reset, we tend to focus on these big things like the Berenstein Bears, which is

310
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,700
 my favorite example, because that to me is true.

311
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,980
 Berenstein Bears was not called the Berenstain Bears ever.

312
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,260
 It was spelled S-T-E-I-N.

313
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,600
 We can also look at it like this, where this young woman, young girl who lived her life,

314
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,920
 she lived in a reality where they had a pool.

315
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,360
 And for whatever reason, whatever happened, she shifted to a reality.

316
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,120
 That's a big change because she said, "My childhood was centered around this pool.

317
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,560
 My buddy Josh Mormeyer used to have a pool.

318
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
 We were in it all the time.

319
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,920
 Having a pool in your backyard is a huge magnet to hanging out."

320
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,100
 I hung out with him because he was cool too, but he did have an awesome pool.

321
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,740
 The idea is, imagine if that disappeared and all those memories are the only one who remembers

322
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,860
 them.

323
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,900
 It's terrifying, right?

324
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,780
 It really would break your reality.

325
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,900
 You would think, "What is real?"

326
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,500
 Like if I could have eight years of memories and then one day wake up and realize that

327
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,460
 they didn't exist and no one else remembered them, "What is real?

328
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,460
 What is reality?

329
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,160
 Does anyone remember me?

330
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,240
 Like could I possibly wake up tomorrow and no one knows who I am?

331
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,840
 Is it possible that I just cease to exist at any moment?"

332
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,400
 And everyone forgets that I ever was a part of their lives.

333
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,880
 Did you think about how many first kisses were in this pool?

334
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,040
 How many crushes did you invite over to swim in the pool?

335
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,200
 Or when you're eating the cake and your feet are dangling in the pool and you're having

336
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,840
 these touching childhood memories?

337
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,780
 They're all gone.

338
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,380
 So if that type of stuff can disappear, if something as big as a pool can disappear and

339
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,940
 no one else notices it, that would really, really wreck with your sense of safety.

340
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
 Terrifying story.

341
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,540
 I mean, it's interesting.

342
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,860
 What is the rational thing for this?

343
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,020
 Did she have some sort of aneurysm?

344
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,820
 Did she make it all up?

345
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,980
 If she's telling the truth, obviously she could have made this story up.

346
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,920
 If she's telling the truth and there's a rational explanation, what is it?

347
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,120
 A long waking dream?

348
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,600
 Some sort of epileptic seizure that causes this long vision?

349
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
 I'll put an episode in the show notes called "The Lamp."

350
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,960
 That's something like that.

351
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,160
 Somebody gets some brain damage and then they live out an alternate life in the course of

352
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
 like a couple seconds.

353
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 I'll put it on the show notes.

354
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,640
 It's a really good episode.

355
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,000
 But what would be the cause of that?

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,780
 And if that, what's the rational cause, but then as far as the paranormal conspiracy cause,

357
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,700
 I said that this happened in 2012.

358
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,820
 Specifically, it happened in December 2012.

359
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,220
 And any good conspiracy theorist remembers that that is when the world was supposed to

360
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,220
 end.

361
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,980
 That was when the Mayan calendar was supposed to come to a crashing stop and the world was

362
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,220
 supposed to suffer the anger of the gods.

363
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,680
 So maybe, maybe the Mayans were half right.

364
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,320
 Maybe the world wasn't going to end.

365
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,040
 Maybe the entire prediction was for a pool to cease to exist.

366
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,360
 But again, that timing is very interesting.

367
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,040
 Did something big happen in 2012?

368
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,840
 Reality bending stuff is always really fascinating to me.

369
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,640
 And again, if a pool can disappear, why can't a human?

370
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
 Creepy, creepy stuff.

371
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,760
 Radar, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

372
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,840
 We are leaving behind this backyard.

373
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,040
 We're stealing her pool.

374
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
 We're siphoning the water.

375
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 Glug, glug, glug, glug.

376
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,660
 She's like, "No, bring me back my memories."

377
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,060
 We're leaving behind this young lady with no pool.

378
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,180
 We're headed all the way out.

379
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,740
 Out of orbit.

380
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,740
 We're headed, ladies and gentlemen, to the sun.

381
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:30,860
 There's this meme going around from this guy named Indy City made this little basically

382
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,300
 like a writing prompt.

383
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:44,280
 The concept is the sun is probably the closest thing we'll ever have to a true eldrick abomination.

384
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,560
 This Cthulhu level like horror.

385
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,840
 Very fanciful.

386
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,120
 We see them in all of these works of literature.

387
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,240
 We have them in our most ancient myths.

388
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,720
 But the sun in our skies is the closest thing we'll have to one in reality.

389
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,280
 This is the way that Indy City lays it out.

390
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,940
 It's older than recorded history.

391
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,220
 We can't even comprehend how long it's already been here.

392
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,080
 We can say four billion years, but how does that even rationalize that?

393
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,220
 It existed long before the planet did.

394
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,620
 And even though it does have a finite life cycle, unlike the truly immortal and all powerful

395
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,540
 Cthulhu web out to you, even though it does have a finite life cycle, it's far longer

396
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,980
 than any human life could ever be.

397
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,920
 And it's far longer than we could ever comprehend.

398
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,120
 Our longest civilization is but a minute in the life of the sun.

399
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,320
 By looking at it, it instantly burns itself into your vision.

400
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,600
 And if you stare at it too long, you'll go blind.

401
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,440
 The only thing that protects us is the darkness of space, the millions of miles between us

402
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,840
 and it.

403
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,980
 If it was any closer, we wouldn't be around to even observe it.

404
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,580
 You can go blind by looking at it.

405
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:17,340
 If you're exposed to it for too long, unprotected, you'll get cancerous growths on your skin.

406
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,380
 It's so loud.

407
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,020
 Its voice, if you were somehow able to hear it, you would die instantly.

408
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,620
 Its loudness, its volume is 329 decibels.

409
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,440
 That's enough to kill a human being.

410
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,600
 Again, the fact that we have this distance from it is what keeps us alive.

411
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 It's this non-humanoid shape floating through space with massive hundreds of mile long tentacles

412
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,640
 made of flame flickering in the distance.

413
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,560
 Sometimes, these tendrils lash out so wildly that flares, solar flares travel through the

414
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,300
 darkness and still impact Earth.

415
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,460
 Sometimes giving us the beautiful gift of the Aurora Borealis.

416
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,260
 Oddly enough, the more advanced we get, the closer we get to being a civilization that

417
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,820
 can harness the power of the sun, the more vulnerable we are.

418
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,260
 Because we can have one of these solar flares go off and it completely fries all of our electronics

419
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,820
 and puts us back into a pagan state, a stone age state.

420
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:31,340
 We can go from the most advanced society, the most advanced known race in the universe

421
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,740
 to living like cavemen overnight.

422
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:42,000
 And the only thing that prevents that is, are we in the way of these sun's angry lashes?

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,720
 So it's almost like the Tower of Babel, right?

424
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,280
 You build a tower to talk to God, God destroys it.

425
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,200
 We build a civilization, we talk about harnessing the power of the sun, but if the God doesn't

426
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,940
 want that, if this eldritch abomination does not want that, with a simple flick of flame

427
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,020
 can put us back into a feudal state.

428
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,900
 Population may be a hundred million people, mass die-offs, starvation, people who need

429
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:16,220
 medication dead within weeks, people just at war with each other, immediate barbarism.

430
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,960
 Its mere existence distorts space and time.

431
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,920
 The fact that it is where it is warps the fabric of reality.

432
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,520
 And sucks everything and creates this order around it.

433
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,720
 It is the closest we have to one of the old ones.

434
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:51,060
 It is the closest we have to this unknowable, uncaring, dark God.

435
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,100
 It was interesting, I was like, "Dude, that's really dope, right?"

436
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,740
 It's really interesting to think of it that way.

437
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,620
 I want to give a shout out to Yuli Ban who posted this in the first place.

438
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,780
 Indy City wrote it, Yuli Ban reposted it, and then I got to give a shout out.

439
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,780
 So that in and of itself is really cool.

440
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,940
 It's just an interesting way to look at things.

441
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,720
 So what's dope is that we have this other user hop in named PabGuy and posted a link

442
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 that took the story in a whole other direction.

443
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,680
 He posted a link to an article from Inverse.com which is a science and science fiction website.

444
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,400
 They cover movies and they cover real stuff, rocket ships and space and all that stuff.

445
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,280
 They covered this article called "The Rocket Scientist Who Woke the Stars."

446
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,820
 And who they're speaking about is this guy named Greg Matloth.

447
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,820
 He's a former propulsion scientist for NASA.

448
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,020
 And he's currently an adjunct associate professor of physics.

449
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,940
 And so he deals with a lot of the real science behind this stuff.

450
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,500
 But one day he was given this class, and a big thing when we look at the universe at

451
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,540
 large, when we see something on a galactic sail that doesn't make sense, we go, "Oh,

452
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,880
 it must be dark matter.

453
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,540
 There must be something out there that we can't see that's moving these stars, that's

454
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,840
 making these things act the way they are because they don't fit the current model we have

455
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,480
 of the universe."

456
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 But we're looking at it.

457
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,800
 We can observe it's doing this, but it doesn't match what we currently know about the universe.

458
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,440
 So dark matter is the answer.

459
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
 We can't observe it.

460
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,560
 There's no proof that it's there except that something's happening in a way it shouldn't

461
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
 happen.

462
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,720
 He was teaching this class and one of the students brought up.

463
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,280
 He goes, "Hey, teach."

464
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
 He's kicking back.

465
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 He's wearing a leather jacket.

466
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 It's the fonds.

467
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
 He goes, "Hey, teach."

468
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,900
 We're talking about this dark matter stuff, but we've been researching dark matter for

469
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,000
 90 years and we are no closer to proving it.

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,060
 We know nothing more about dark matter than we did 90 years ago.

471
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,820
 It's bunk.

472
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
 Greg thought about that.

473
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,700
 Greg, Greg, that really kind of got to him.

474
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
 He expelled the kid.

475
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
 He's like, "Get out."

476
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,500
 He thought about that and he goes, "That is interesting.

477
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,760
 We've been running the same theories for 90 years.

478
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,860
 Is it true?"

479
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,320
 And he starts looking at all these different options and he starts to really kind of delve

480
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,960
 into the science of it.

481
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,360
 How could this be happening?

482
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,960
 And at the same time, he starts to think about consciousness.

483
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,840
 This is so weird.

484
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
 This is all theoretical and I want to be totally fair.

485
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,360
 This article, it's very, very well written.

486
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 Greg Matloff comes off as a very, very smart guy.

487
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,800
 It's going to be filtered through me.

488
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,160
 It's going to be filtered through me.

489
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,980
 Actually, I can express this as well as he did.

490
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
 He says this.

491
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,340
 He goes, "We do not understand what consciousness is.

492
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,740
 We understand how the brain works.

493
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,300
 We understand how the electrons..."

494
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,700
 It's not pronounced like that, Jason.

495
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,820
 We understand how the electrons in your brain and the nerve in your thoughts.

496
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
 We understand how it works.

497
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,940
 We understand biologically how the brain works.

498
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,860
 But we do not understand consciousness at all.

499
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,020
 We don't know what starts it.

500
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,500
 We don't know what keeps it going.

501
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,960
 And we don't know if you have to be human to have consciousness.

502
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,120
 We don't even know if you have to be alive to have consciousness.

503
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,920
 And he goes because on the quantum level, in real life, I can keep putting my fingers

504
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,360
 on this door and my fingers will not go through this door.

505
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,360
 But on a quantum level, when you get small enough to the quantum level, there is a chance

506
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,140
 that a wave will pass through a barrier.

507
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,820
 Because on the quantum level, the rules don't apply.

508
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,060
 And when we look at it on a galactic level, the rules start to get wonky too.

509
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:39,500
 So he says if consciousness is waves, if the consciousness is just waves moving that are

510
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,660
 carrying these thoughts or processing this information, on a quantum level, those consciousness

511
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:54,160
 waves can leave the barrier and soak out into the universe.

512
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,880
 There is no reason to think that a consciousness only exists in the human brain once and forever.

513
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,000
 On the quantum level, these waves are getting out and they are seeping into the universe.

514
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,760
 And if they can leave a barrier, what's to prevent them from going into something else?

515
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
 What is consciousness?

516
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,200
 What causes consciousness?

517
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,740
 Do you have to be alive to be conscious?

518
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,260
 Can a rock be conscious?

519
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,140
 Can a planet be conscious?

520
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,700
 Can the sun be conscious?

521
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,300
 He goes listen, this is what we're looking at.

522
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:38,140
 We're seeing these suns, these stars throughout the galaxy acting in ways they shouldn't act.

523
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,760
 We see stars group up in a way that based on what we know about gravity, based on what

524
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,160
 we know about space time, based on what we know about physics, these suns should not

525
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,080
 be doing this specific activity.

526
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,260
 But we can clearly observe it and we observe it all over the galaxy.

527
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,060
 What is causing that?

528
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,900
 And so he goes on to say, what if it's not dark matter?

529
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,400
 We can't prove it.

530
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,860
 What if these suns, these stars are deciding to do that?

531
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,580
 These stars are conscious.

532
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,740
 Fascinating, fascinating article.

533
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:23,620
 He goes on to talk about how a sun could change its own path.

534
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
 Because that's what they're doing.

535
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,380
 They're moving in a way that just doesn't make sense by any known science.

536
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,280
 And we see this all over the place.

537
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:37,380
 And he goes, it's possible a sun could actively push out electrons in one direction to constantly

538
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,300
 be manipulating itself to stay in a location.

539
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,540
 And to be fair, the article goes, this is one thing he says and this is why that's not

540
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,300
 true and this is another thing he says and this is why that's not true.

541
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,780
 It's not in attacking, even he admits, he goes, there are pros and cons to all of my

542
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
 arguments.

543
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,900
 But very, very interesting article.

544
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,940
 And I hope I'm saying it correctly.

545
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,440
 But the gist of it is we don't know why the stars are doing this.

546
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,120
 This is a possible theory that they are conscious and they are doing it because that is what

547
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,320
 they want to do.

548
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 So awesome.

549
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,120
 I read this the other day.

550
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,440
 I was like, you can't wait to share this with you guys because we look at the sun and that's

551
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,360
 such a constant, right?

552
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,960
 And we're told by science it will sit there for billions of years.

553
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,440
 I could sit there for billions of years before and it'll eventually get bigger and bigger

554
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,820
 and Earth will end up being the closest planet to the sun and all life will be burned off

555
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
 of it.

556
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,860
 Hopefully we're on 15 different planets and eight star systems by then.

557
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,740
 Maybe we will harness the power of the sun by then.

558
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,220
 But all of that takes into account that the sun is just an object.

559
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,980
 It's just a thing.

560
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,540
 And in this theory, it could just go, I'm done.

561
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,040
 And begin to slowly float away.

562
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:03,720
 It would start to drag the solar system in one direction until eventually planets kind

563
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,640
 of fall out of its gravitational pull and go tumbling into the darkness.

564
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,440
 And the sun just moves on.

565
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,400
 And what would we do to stop that?

566
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,460
 With all of our technology, if the sun did start first off, we wonder why it was doing

567
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
 it, right?

568
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,140
 We're like, this doesn't fit any of our models.

569
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,620
 What would we possibly do?

570
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,460
 Humanity would have to hitch a ride.

571
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,740
 We'd have to figure out a way to stay next to it.

572
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,340
 Which we couldn't, right?

573
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:38,060
 And we just move past us and leave us alone in the darkness.

574
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,020
 We all die off.

575
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:47,800
 No longer given the heat, no longer given the life from this great God in the sky.

576
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
 It's left us.

577
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
 It's abandoned us.

578
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,920
 That is the greatest fear of all believers that your God abandons you.

579
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,720
 But maybe there is a way to keep the sun with us.

580
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,640
 Maybe there is a way to prove to the sun that it shouldn't leave us.

581
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,720
 It should never leave us.

582
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,060
 It should always keep us around.

583
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,640
 Maybe the way to convince the sun to stay is to return to the old ways.

584
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,760
 Something that nearly every culture has done.

585
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,840
 Human sacrifices to the great ball of fire in the sky.

586
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:39,540
 A mass calling of humanity to prove to the sun we are now and forever its children.

587
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:47,800
 If the sun does have a consciousness, if the sun does look down upon earth and watches us,

588
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:55,760
 watches over us, how would we show it that we still love it?

589
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,520
 Love it even more than our own brothers and sisters.

590
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:10,060
 Than to spill warm human flesh for our all knowing, all powerful, blazing sun.

591
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:16,940
 It gives us life and we worship it by giving it death.

592
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:27,540
