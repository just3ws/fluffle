1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 After a man's mother passes away, it's time to clean her house, and then he makes a horrifying discovery.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,400
 A bizarre and obscure conspiracy pops up and then disappears on 4chan, but has staggering implications.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,700
 And then we take a trip to the Octavius, a boat that was spotted off the coast of Greenland in 1775.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,900
 Is it possible that a boat became so encased in ice that its crew froze in place?

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,900
 We'll find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,900
 [Music]

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,600
 Just a quick reminder, Halloween, October 31st here in Hood River, the River City Saloon.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,900
 The band's Sundiver is having their album release party. I will be there.

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,400
 If you're nearby, you should come check it out too. Sundiver's a great band.

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,400
 They're friends of mine. I really, really like their music, and I will be there.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,100
 So if you don't have Halloween plans, if you want to wear your costume to a local bar and dance to new music,

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
 come on out to the River City Saloon October 31st.

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,800
 That's not a plug. They're not paying me for any of that.

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,300
 They're just friends of mine.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
 Let's go ahead and get started here. We've got a lot of stuff to cover.

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,600
 Little Grimm, we're starting off a little Grimm.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,900
 Little Grimm. So if you guys are like, "Alright, dude, I'm eating this big ol' burrito.

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,900
 This giant nine-pound burrito.

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,600
 You might want to put that away for right now.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,300
 Pick it up. The next story, if you haven't had a time.

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,100
 Let's hop into Jason Jalopy. We're going to drive over to St. Louis, Missouri.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,400
 [imitates car engine]

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,100
 We're driving our car, right? Well, it's my car. You're simply a passenger in it.

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,900
 Don't get it twisted, guys.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,300
 We're driving the Jason Jalopy. It's not called the "you" car.

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,500
 It's the Jason Jalopy. Unless your name's Jason, then I guess you can make a claim to it.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,300
 We're driving to St. Louis, Missouri. It's July 30th, 2019.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
 So not too long ago, a couple months ago.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 There's a dude named Adam Smith, right? And his mom is not doing well, so it's one of those stories.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,900
 The mom is sick and he moves back to take care of his mom, which I think is kind of like,

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,200
 people always make fun of people who live with their parents,

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,700
 but there's little asterisks there if you're taking care of them, then.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,700
 You should really shouldn't make fun of who's living with who anyways.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,500
 I've never been one of those guys like, "What? You still live with your parents and you're like 48?

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,900
 I don't care where you live." I never really cared about that.

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,900
 But, people do. Some people do, and they're jerks.

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,600
 And then, like, I don't know, I don't know someone who'd be like,

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,800
 "What? You still live with your mom? Oh, what a loser, dude.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,400
 How come you haven't moved out yet?" And you're like, "Oh, she's dying of cancer."

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,200
 And they're like, "What cancer? That's a lame disease. Oh my God. That's so stupid."

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,300
 Like, I guess there probably are people out there like that.

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,200
 But anyways, Adam Smith, he moves in at his mom's house because she's dying.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,400
 And there's probably some guy like, "What? Adam Smith? That's a lame name and your mom's dying.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
 That's totally lame. My mom's immortal. She'll never die."

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,700
 Like, who is this jerk? Why, he's this guy following me around.

49
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,300
 But anyways, Adam Smith's mother does eventually pass away.

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,900
 Now, he's at the point where he's like, "I gotta start cleaning the house up. What else are you gonna do?"

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,200
 It's not like he's like, "Ooh, a week's up one morning." He's like, "Oh, my mom's dead."

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,300
 Better clean up. Like, I think it was more of a nesting thing.

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,100
 Like, let's start getting rid of all this stuff.

54
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,300
 'Cause I remember when, like, my grandma passed away, we went over and we just started throwing stuff away.

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,500
 It's a weird, like, psychological thing.

56
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
 We're not like, mementos.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,500
 Pfft. War medals. Throw those in the garbage can. It's just like a weird...

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,300
 You want the house to almost return to a uncluttered state. It's really weird.

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,000
 Like, I remember when my grandma passed away, everyone went to the house and just started cleaning up.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 And I was like, "Don't we have better things to do? Play video games or something?"

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,900
 Now I'm just joking. I love my grandma.

62
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,200
 But it was just a weird psychological thing, 'cause I even found myself picking stuff up.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,500
 And I never clean up.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,300
 Anyways, Adam Smith is cleaning stuff up.

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,500
 And he's, like, putting stuff in garbage bags and everything.

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,700
 Like, I don't know why I needed that. You know how humans clean up.

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,900
 Anyways, he's cleaning up.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,000
 Now, in the freezer, there was all... There's much like junk in the freezer and stuff like that.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
 And there was always this box that she kept in the freezer.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,300
 And ever since he was a little boy... He's in his forties now, I believe?

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:36,100
 Ever since he was a little boy, there was a box that his mom said, "Don't look in that box."

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,900
 It's a piece of wedding cake. It's like an old memento.

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,800
 I don't know if that's just an American thing, but when people get married,

74
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,500
 they save a slice of the cake, of the wedding cake, and then they put it away.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,100
 I thought they were supposed to eat it a year, the next year, or whatever.

76
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
 I don't care, because I think weddings are kind of stupid.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,700
 But it's some sort of tradition.

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,700
 Now, she's like, "Don't ever look in that box. It's a piece of my wedding cake."

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,800
 Now, unless your wedding cake came from the Ark of the Covenant,

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,300
 I don't know why he couldn't look in the box, but she told him not to look in the box.

81
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,000
 Fast forward 40-some-odd years, she passes away.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
 Now, apparently, this wasn't a one-time thing. This wasn't like he was six.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,500
 He's like, "Mommy, what's in the box?" And she's like, "Don't ever look in the box."

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,700
 Apparently, this wasn't like... and I also wasn't an everyday thing.

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,400
 "Hey, Ma, what's up? What's for dinner? Can I look in the box?"

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,100
 And she's like, "Damn it, Adam!"

87
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:37,600
 No, you can't look in the box, but apparently, between asking every day and asking once,

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,600
 somewhere in between those two, he did ask a couple times, "Hey, can I look in the box?"

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
 And she's like, "No, it's wedding cake in the box.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,600
 You'll turn to stone if you look at it."

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,500
 Anyways, mother passes away. He's cleaning stuff out.

92
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,600
 And he goes, "I'm gonna look in the box. I'm gonna look what's in the box. See what's in here."

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,300
 So...

94
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,500
 [grunt]

95
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,200
 He opens the squeaky freezer door.

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,100
 [grunt]

97
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,500
 Cowboy, bats are flying up.

98
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,400
 [bats growling]

99
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,500
 I don't know what sound a bat makes.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,600
 [bats squeaking]

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,300
 And he goes and he grabs the box. And he opens it up.

102
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,600
 Now, he says, "This box had been there as long as he's been alive."

103
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 Now, I guess you guys, I guess there's a bit of a spoiler alert.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 If there's a news article about what's in the box, it's not like a treasure map.

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,500
 I guess it could be a treasure map. It's a treasure map.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,200
 But it's not a treasure map. He opens the box up and he sees like a little pink blanket.

107
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
 He's like, "Oh."

108
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,200
 And then he kind of like sticks his hand into the box.

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,000
 Because maybe the blanket's like covering up some delicious wedding cake. He wants to get to it.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,500
 He puts his hand in the box. He feels a tiny foot.

111
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,900
 So, in the box that's been in the freezer this entire time, is a dead baby.

112
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:02,200
 And it's possible it's his sister, which would be less creepy.

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,400
 Now, when I say dead baby, I don't... I'm not assuming it's like an eight-month-old baby.

114
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
 Because it can fit in a freezer.

115
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,200
 So, I don't know... I don't know the dimensions of babies.

116
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400
 Visa-V freezers that are 40 years old.

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,600
 Wait a second. Did she get a free... like when her refrigerator...

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,500
 No refrigerator lasts that long.

119
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,000
 So, when her refrigerator broke, you're like, "Jason, that is not the point.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,100
 That is not the point about how long a frigid air works.

121
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,800
 But no, stay with me. We'll get to the other part. We'll get to the baby part."

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,900
 I mean, think about it. Like, how many times have you had...

123
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,900
 I've maybe had like one fridge go out in my life and you got, "Ah, you'll load everything out."

124
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,400
 So, you're telling me she moved this baby to two, maybe three fridges.

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,700
 And you're like, "Jason, that's not the point."

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,000
 So, go back to the baby part. Okay.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,700
 Apparently, the son says my mom was always super secretive.

128
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,300
 She would never tell really anyone anything.

129
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,200
 One time, I asked what was in her chocolate chip cookie recipe

130
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,000
 and she slapped me across the face. That didn't happen.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,200
 Don't sue me, Adam.

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
 But anyway, apparently, she was super secretive.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,500
 And he said, "I also... She also made statements that I might have...

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,800
 Like, I had a sister out there that she gave it for adoption."

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,100
 He goes, "But either this... This is a human baby."

136
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,500
 And the cops are like, "Yeah, this is a real baby. It's not an adult."

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 So, it's either my sister or some random baby.

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,800
 And I honestly don't know which one's more disturbing.

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,500
 He didn't say that. I'm sure. I don't know.

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,800
 Jason Carpenter. We're back in me. I don't know which one is more disturbing.

141
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,100
 Finding a baby in your fridge or freezer. Sorry, the fridge wouldn't last very long.

142
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
 It'd be like a couple of weeks top.

143
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,700
 Finding a baby in your freezer and you're like, "Oh my God.

144
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,400
 My mom found or killed a random child stuck in the freezer."

145
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,300
 That's pretty disturbing because then you're like, "Who's kid was that? Like, are they still looking for him?"

146
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,100
 You open it up and it's a sister, like a little baby.

147
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,000
 I wonder how old it was now that I... I don't know why they didn't mention that.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
 Because again, I don't think it was like a toddler. I think it was probably like a tiny little baby.

149
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 I don't know. A month?

150
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,600
 Like, it has to... Obviously, if the baby was too big, you're like, "Jason, again, why are you focusing?"

151
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,200
 Okay, I'm not going to focus on the dimensions of the baby.

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,900
 The point is, is that a dude found a baby that might be his sister.

153
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
 This happened back in July.

154
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,200
 And it's interesting because he's saying, "Let's do some DNA on it, man.

155
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,700
 Let's find out if it's my sister."

156
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,200
 And the cops really don't seem super concerned about it.

157
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 Because she's dead.

158
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,000
 So even if... Like, let's say they do the DNA on the baby and it's not hers.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,900
 And then what? Now they have this huge... Like, now they got to go find a parent of a baby who went missing.

160
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,300
 And they're like, "Yeah, we got... We got more important."

161
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,800
 It's weird. I've learned doing this show because I've been having research a lot more like current true crime stuff.

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,500
 There's a lot of stuff cops are like, "Yeah, we're too busy."

163
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,600
 And if there's not a victim and the suspect is dead,

164
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
 then we're not going to even bother with it.

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,700
 I'm sure they're doing something with this,

166
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,000
 but I'm sure the cop... You know, DNA stuff takes a long time or a lot of money.

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,700
 I'm sure the cops are like, "If it is someone else's baby and she killed this kid and threw it in the freezer,

168
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,200
 she's dead so there's nothing we can do about that."

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,100
 If it's her own kid and she gave birth to it and threw it in the freezer, it's tragic,

170
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
 but there's nothing we can do about that.

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,800
 So I don't really think they're in too much of a hurry to get this DNA stuff done.

172
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,600
 And I don't think Adam Smith can go down to the coroner's office and be like,

173
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
 "Hey, can I get a couple toenails?"

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,500
 Like, I think that window has passed.

175
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,100
 I think that any DNA he wanted to get from the baby, he should have gotten from the beginning,

176
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
 and that's disgusting.

177
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,900
 He's not going to be like, "Oh, no, I made a horrifying discovery."

178
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,200
 "Hmm, where's my nail clippers?"

179
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,400
 So anyways, the gross story, guy finds a baby in his mom's fridge, and no answers.

180
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 Mom, very, very secretive.

181
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,000
 So the moral of the story is if someone ever goes, "Don't look in that box."

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,100
 "Look in the box."

183
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,400
 That's the moral of the story.

184
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,100
 I probably would have looked in the box earlier when I was a kid and someone said,

185
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,000
 "Don't look in that box."

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,100
 And I kept going, "What's in the box?"

187
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
 And they're like, "Don't look in the box."

188
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,000
 I would have snuck a look.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,100
 But that story would have been horrible because then I might have ended up in a box.

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,800
 I'm going to do what they do in YouTube videos.

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 "Hey, guys, you tell me what's more disturbing.

192
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,900
 Your sister in a box or a random baby in the box?

193
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,600
 Comment down below, like and share and subscribe to this podcast.

194
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
 What do you think is more disturbing?

195
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,400
 Click on the poll in the left-hand side of the screen.

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,500
 Okay, let's go ahead.

197
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
 Speaking of YouTube, that's actually a good transition.

198
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
 I came across this conspiracy theory.

199
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,900
 I don't even know if I would consider it a conspiracy theory, but something interesting.

200
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,000
 Leading to a conspiracy theory, and probably about two weeks ago, three weeks ago on 4chan.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,900
 It was a thread that went up, had maybe 13 replies, and then disappeared.

202
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,600
 That archive, no one was interested in it.

203
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,900
 The first post said, "I'm not supposed to reveal any of this, but you guys don't believe anything anyway, so here you go."

204
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,200
 And it was a link to a pasted bin file.

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,300
 So it took people a while to want to click on the pasted bin file, because you don't know what you're going to get.

206
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,600
 And this is what it was.

207
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,500
 Now, I'm always intrigued by conspiracy theories that are mundane and believable and something that can happen.

208
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,400
 Hillary Clinton eating babies, shape-shifting reptilians, controlling the planet Earth, stuff like that.

209
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,600
 You're like, "They seem to be the most popular ones, but they're just far, far too unwieldy."

210
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 Hillary Clinton may or may not eat human babies.

211
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,200
 I don't know.

212
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,800
 I'm going to say that most likely not, but I could be swayed to the other side.

213
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,400
 However, I think so much time is spent determining whether or not Hillary Clinton--

214
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,600
 And the reason why I keep bringing that one, because that is probably, I think, the funniest conspiracy theory out right now.

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,100
 Because it's so specific.

216
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,500
 It's not reptilians are taking over the planet.

217
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,700
 That's very vague.

218
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,000
 NASA's trying to destroy the flat Earth myth.

219
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,800
 Those are kind of vague, because you're like, "Who, when, what, who's NASA?"

220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,000
 Well, I know who NASA is, but who at NASA?

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,400
 When did this conspiracy theory get started?

222
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,100
 They're pretty vague.

223
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:25,200
 Hillary Clinton eats human babies might be one of the most specific conspiracy theories, because we straight up have the who.

224
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 It's not just Democrats or politicians or whatever the elite.

225
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,900
 It's this particular person does this particular thing.

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,000
 And it's because apparently she has holes in her tongue, which are caused when you eat human brains.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
 It's some sort of brainway.

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,200
 That's the first time I heard about it.

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,500
 But now this is a Hillary Clinton eats human babies episode.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,600
 But that's 100% probably my favorite conspiracy theory out right now.

231
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
 There's some photos of her with holes in her tongue.

232
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,600
 And so people said, "That's what happens when you eat human babies."

233
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
 And then they started basically working backwards.

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
 And then Pizza Gate got involved in that.

235
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,900
 They're eating babies in Pizza Gate.

236
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:11,000
 And then there was that video frazzled rip, or frazzled drip, depending on how you want to pronounce it.

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,400
 Where apparently it's her and you might have a Dean eating a baby.

238
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,800
 She's been completely debunked.

239
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,300
 She doesn't eat.

240
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,900
 She may or may not eat babies.

241
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
 But anyways, apparently this is a baby episode now.

242
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:29,300
 Anyways, that conspiracy aside, which I think is just absolutely hilarious.

243
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
 I like the more mundane conspiracy theories.

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
 I like the more things that can affect us really.

245
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,300
 This one actually affects me, I think, more than most people.

246
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,500
 So on this 4chan thread, this guy puts up this paceman.

247
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,600
 And it's a transcript of an interview.

248
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,100
 There is no sourcing for the interview.

249
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
 It's not telling us what show it's from.

250
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
 If it's a podcast, a YouTube show, we don't know.

251
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,300
 It doesn't tell us the names of the interviewer or the interviewee.

252
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,700
 Very, very vague.

253
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,600
 So if this was about almost any other conspiracy theory, if they're like,

254
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,300
 "We got a transcript from a show about aliens."

255
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:15,100
 And this guy says that aliens are coming down and making Hillary Clinton eat babies.

256
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,700
 I'd completely trash it.

257
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,500
 I'd be like, it's fan fiction.

258
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,600
 But because this one is so mundane and almost so unimportant on the surface,

259
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
 it's weird that someone would type out this transcript and totally make it up.

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Because it really doesn't have a lot of relevance when you first look at it.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,200
 What it is, is this transcript, and I'll have the paceman link,

262
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,500
 purports to be an interview between a host of some sort of show

263
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,100
 and a man going by the pseudonym of Tim C.

264
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,500
 And Tim C says, "I'm a social media influencer."

265
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,200
 And when YouTube first started off, I realized, "Whoa, this is going to be something big."

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,600
 So I got a bunch of fake account setup.

267
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,700
 I created a script.

268
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
 This was back when YouTube, you just needed an email account.

269
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,600
 So I started a script, made about 3-6 million email accounts,

270
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,200
 and then got all of these YouTube accounts.

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
 And he goes, "Over the years, I've lost some of them.

272
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:19,400
 They've been shut down for being bots, but I still have about 3 million fake YouTube accounts right now."

273
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,100
 And the interviewer goes, "Oh, so what are you doing?"

274
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,500
 He goes, "I actually started off by...

275
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,300
 If I saw a channel I really liked, I would prop it up.

276
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,500
 I would subscribe." He goes, "It used to be a million subscribers. It was a huge deal."

277
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,100
 So I would take a couple million of my subscribers and subscribe into this channel, and it would boost them up.

278
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,900
 And people would be like, "Oh, I'm going to go check this out because it messes with the algorithm.

279
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,700
 People will be recommending the show.

280
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,800
 People will have the show recommended to them because all of a sudden the show has one, two, three million followers."

281
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,000
 He goes, "But nowadays, a million followers really isn't a big deal.

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,600
 So this is what I do now.

283
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,000
 I find the channel that I hate. I absolutely can't stand them. I watch them.

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,300
 I hate watching them."

285
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,800
 And then I go, "Oh, these guys totally suck."

286
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,500
 And I give them 3 million subscribers.

287
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 So now all of a sudden the show goes from having, you know, 10, 20,000 subscribers.

288
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,200
 And it doesn't do it overnight because that would be obvious, but you send 10,000 subscribers checking it out a day.

289
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
 You think it's a viral thing. I've seen that happen with this channel.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,700
 Now, I've never had a viral success, but I'll see a certain video or a certain...

291
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,900
 It usually happens on YouTube because it's much easier, but I'll have a...

292
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,600
 Like, my Kevin Spacey video got like 10,000, 15,000 views in the first day.

293
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,300
 And most of my videos don't even come close to that over the course of their lifetime.

294
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,000
 He's saying that I watch this video and then I'll just start throwing subscribers.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,100
 And as a content creator, you see you getting like 10,000 subscribers today.

296
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,800
 You're like, "Oh my God, I finally broke it. I've gone viral. Woohoo! Give me high five, mom.

297
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,400
 Give me high five, sister." It's just a box. It's just a little frozen box in the corner.

298
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
 You're like, "I'll give you high five later."

299
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,300
 And you have this go on.

300
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,900
 And the guy's like, "I thought you said you hated these YouTubers."

301
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,300
 And he's like, "I do."

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,100
 So what I do is once I give them millions of subscribers and their growth starts to take off,

303
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,800
 I then continue to watch their content.

304
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:20,600
 And he goes, "Once they make something like a content or a speech or a political stance or something,

305
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,500
 that to me makes it seem like they're really like putting themselves out there or opening themselves up

306
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,100
 or making a statement that they feel very, very close to, very, very powerful to."

307
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,300
 So let's say that somebody comes out, they do normal content,

308
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,500
 and then one day they release an episode and they're like,

309
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 "I think I'm going to take a stand against bullying or teen suicide or something like that.

310
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,400
 Like, I had a friend who killed themselves and I want to take a stand against teen suicide.

311
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,000
 I want to start this donation thing, whatever."

312
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,400
 This guy, Tim C., will then unsubscribe with three million followers like that.

313
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,000
 So to the content creator, they think they did something wrong and they totally freak out.

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,500
 And then he watches them backtrack and being like, "I'm so sorry if I offended you guys with my anti-suicide stance.

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 I didn't know I had so many people who were protein suicide.

316
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 I'm so sorry guys. Okay, so this is what I'm going to do.

317
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,000
 I'm going to cancel my donation to the suicide people.

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,500
 I'm going to start doing Momo challenge videos.

319
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,000
 Please come back to my show. Please come back."

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And he says he just does it for fun.

321
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 He likes destroying these people's channels who he doesn't like in the first place.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,500
 And then he waits for them to do something that is very meaningful to them and then he basically loses them.

323
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 Now, so, and then the interviewer goes, do they do that all the time?

324
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,000
 He goes, "Yes, everyone but one person went, walked back on their viewpoints.

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 They feel made them lose their subscriber, which they did because I'm watching it and I took the subscribers away because of what they just said.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Most of them have tried walking back.

327
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,500
 He goes, "One person doubled down and was like, 'I don't care what you guys think.

328
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 I'm still going to do this.'

329
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,000
 And then the interviewer goes, "Did you give them the subscribers back?"

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,500
 And Tim Sea goes, "No."

331
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 I was actually bored at that point and just kind of walked away.

332
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,000
 And at that point, the interview ended.

333
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So he had one person who actually doubled down and said, "I don't care what you guys think.

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,500
 This is what I believe."

335
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 Now, that's an interesting and that went up.

336
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 A couple of people replied to it and then it disappeared.

337
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,000
 And this is the type of conspiracy theory that I think is actually far more impactful than whether or not Hillary Clinton eats babies.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
 I'm not a baby.

339
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 So it doesn't really matter to me.

340
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 Plus, I don't think it's true.

341
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 It's not just that I'm like, "Ah, those other babies."

342
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
 They've been for themselves.

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Hillary Clinton's running through the jungle looking for young people.

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I just love that conspiracy theory from my favorite one right now.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But anyways, this is a conspiracy theory that I think actually affects people because you go,

346
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 "Well, I don't have a YouTube channel.

347
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
 I'm not worried about it."

348
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,000
 And that's true.

349
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 But 3 million of anyone is very, very impactful.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
 And you could do this thing with Twitter.

351
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,000
 He goes, "I have different accounts with different things, but YouTube's the most influential one."

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But you could do types of stuff like this with Twitter or Instagram.

353
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 You can prop up viewpoints that you like and destroy viewpoints that you don't.

354
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And a lot of people, the media does that.

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,500
 A lot of people do that.

356
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
 All sectors.

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
 They'll bury stuff they don't like.

358
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 But I think the fact that you can have this one person basically causing people to reevaluate their positions for fun,

359
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,000
 like this guy's doing this for fun, or maybe it's less fun and more like social activism.

360
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,500
 But it's very, very bizarre conspiracy theory, but it's not sexy.

361
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 There's no reptiles.

362
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 There's no blood.

363
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 There's no grand conspiracies.

364
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 It's just the guy kind of messing with people on an individual level.

365
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,000
 But what happens is it does end up influencing content overall.

366
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Because if people are making a particular video,

367
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,500
 someone, all of a sudden they're super popular because they got 3 million views,

368
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 other people are going to start making content like that guy's content.

369
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,000
 But it's not going to get that big boost and you're like, "Jason, really, I don't care what type of content is being produced."

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And that's true.

371
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 But I still think it's an interesting thing because it's still a conspiracy that can affect you in that way.

372
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Plus, also, I was thinking about it this way.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 If all of a sudden I got 3 million subscribers and that caused the algorithm to recommend me to other people

374
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 and I ended up getting, say, another 200, 300,000 real subscribers,

375
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,500
 and then I take a 3 million hit, I'd be like, "Well, I still got a net gain of a couple hundred thousand subscribers."

376
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 But I know what this is.

377
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 If I didn't know what this was and this guy did this to me and all of a sudden did a rabbit radio,

378
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 I had 3 million YouTube subscribers, I'd be like, "Oh my God, this is totally awesome.

379
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 I'm going to keep doing episodes where I rap at the end of each episode."

380
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 That's how I got those subs.

381
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 I'm actually not.

382
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 It's fun.

383
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 I think this show, let's do a personal announcement here,

384
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 this show happened to the right point in my life

385
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 because I used to be just a toe, I'm still pretty like cocky,

386
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 but I used to be arrogant.

387
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 I guess I'm still pretty arrogant, but I used to be more aggressively arrogant.

388
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 And I think this show, if I started doing this show when I was like 24, 25,

389
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 it would have crashed and burned and I would have been insufferable to be around.

390
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 It's really, really bizarre.

391
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 I think it happened at the right time where I was like, "Oh, cool. People listen to this show?"

392
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 Awesome.

393
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 When before, I'd be like, "Yes, people listen to my show."

394
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 It's amazing and I think that's just part of growing up and maturing.

395
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 Actually, probably doesn't have anything to do with being like arrogant or cocky

396
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 because I think those are actually pretty good beliefs.

397
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 I think you should, I believe, I want to understand, believe this,

398
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 no one will love you as much as you love yourself,

399
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 so you better love yourself more than life itself.

400
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
 And I do.

401
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 I do.

402
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 Because no one else, if you don't love yourself a thousand percent,

403
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 no one else will love you 500% or 100% or whatever.

404
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 So anyways, and I think that's why when I use terms like arrogant and cocky,

405
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 that's kind of what I'm talking about.

406
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 Like, I love myself.

407
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 I think I'm totally awesome, but when you, I think I was a total,

408
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 I think I was super insufferable as a kid.

409
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 And I could be wrong about that.

410
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 I could be wrong about that, but I think if I had even the slight hints of the success

411
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 I have with this show now, because the show's fairly successful as a podcast.

412
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 It's not successful compared to like a television show or a breakout rock hit,

413
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
 but as a podcast, it's fairly successful.

414
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,500
 If I had that success when I was younger, I would have been a, oh my God,

415
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with me.

416
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 I'd be like, I wish someone ate you when you were a baby.

417
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 Why couldn't she have gone to the Democratic National Convention in 1992?

418
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 Young Jason, let's go ahead.

419
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 And I'm gonna have to stop making the Dylan Needs baby jokes, although I love them.

420
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 Do we have time to do the Octavia story?

421
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 I don't think we do, looking at my timer.

422
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 Let's see, do I have a quick story that I can finish this off on?

423
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 We'll save the Octavia still tomorrow.

424
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Maybe tomorrow we'll do a boat special.

425
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 Do I have anything here real quick?

426
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 I'll do a quick update on Veronica.

427
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 I'll do a quick update on Veronica.

428
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 Veronica's the haunted doll I bought off of eBay a while back.

429
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 You're like, Jason, don't give me filler material.

430
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 No, this is interesting. This is interesting.

431
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 I bought Veronica the haunted doll off eBay a couple weeks ago.

432
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 Now, the vivid dream, so I'm not on the nicotine anymore.

433
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 And so the vivid dream, so let me start over.

434
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 The Veronica the haunted doll was supposedly gonna give you vivid dreams,

435
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 the smell of women's perfume.

436
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 You hear a voice go, hello?

437
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 And doors open and close.

438
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 I've had it since before my birthday, which was the beginning of October.

439
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 And this is what's happened.

440
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 So I was having vivid dreams for a while, but I'm pretty sure I chalked that up to the nicotine withdrawal.

441
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 I'm not on the nicotine anymore.

442
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 No doors are opening and closing, which actually happens a lot in the...

443
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 That actually happens a lot in my apartment because of the wind flow,

444
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 but I've been closing the windows for winter.

445
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 So maybe for the ghost power to work, there has to be some sort of air flow coming through your apartment.

446
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 Oh no, my doors open and close by themselves.

447
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 At the same time the wind was blowing.

448
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 Thank you, ghost.

449
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 And then the woman going, hello?

450
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
 I haven't heard that.

451
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 Now, to be fair, my apartment's not always super silent.

452
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 I'm usually, when I'm here, I'm usually watching something or recording something or editing something.

453
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 It's possible that all day long when I'm not here, a woman's going, hello?

454
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 Hello?

455
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
 Hello?

456
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 And I'm just not hearing it.

457
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 So, but I did have Vivid Dreams for a while, so I was like, could be the nicotine withdrawal,

458
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 could be the baby, could be the ghost baby, but let's go to the women's perfume one.

459
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 This one is weird.

460
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 So the Vivid Dreams, I go, well, you know, nicotine, this one's weird.

461
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 Ever since I got Veronica, or maybe a week after I got Veronica, I sleep on my couch.

462
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 I've always sleep on my couch.

463
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 So my bedroom is a pile of clothes, clean clothes on the bed, and almost every day when I go into my bedroom to grab some clothes,

464
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 I smell the unmistakable scent of somebody smoking cigarettes in my bedroom.

465
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 And it's fairly strong.

466
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 Now, it's not like so strong I'm standing in front of, you know, Phyllis Diller or whatever with her giant cigarette being like, what do you want?

467
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 Love?

468
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 But it's strong enough that I'm like, dude, someone's been smoking cigarettes in my bedroom.

469
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 Now, here's the thing.

470
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 I don't smoke cigarettes, and every so often I'll catch the smell of weed as well.

471
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 But I'm like, I don't definitely don't smoke weed.

472
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 I don't smoke cigarettes.

473
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 And my windows are closed.

474
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 So it's not that it would be coming in through the bedroom.

475
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 It's possible it's coming through the bathroom window, but every so often I'll walk through the apartment complex.

476
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 I'll smell weed.

477
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 I've never walked in the apartment complex and smelled cigarette smoke.

478
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 So the window is going outside or shut.

479
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,500
 And you're like, Jason, but what does any of this have to do with the fact that your haunted doll makes the smell of woman's perfume?

480
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 You're telling us about cigarette smoke in the occasional marijuana.

481
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 Either your doll is having a more fun social life than you.

482
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 It's all standing on the street corner.

483
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 So I'm going to cigarette.

484
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 What do you want?

485
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 Love?

486
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 It's Phyllis Diller's doll.

487
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 Do you guys even remember who Phyllis Diller is?

488
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 Wasn't she?

489
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 No, that was Chloris Leachman on Malcolm in the Middle.

490
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 Phyllis Diller was an old lady comedian.

491
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 I don't remember if she had a cigarette or not.

492
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 That could just be my memory.

493
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 Phyllis Diller was like on episodes of Scooby-Doo in the 70s.

494
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 Anyways, Phyllis Diller.

495
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 I just like the name.

496
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 And I think she smokes cigarettes.

497
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 Anyway, so I go into my bedroom and I smell the smell.

498
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 You go, what does that have to do with haunted dolls or perfume?

499
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 For me personally, I love women who smoke cigarettes.

500
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 I think that's like one of the sexiest...

501
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 Oh, I'm going to say this too, guys.

502
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 If you have just recently quit smoking cigarettes, do not go see Joker.

503
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 I've wanted a cigarette since I've watched that movie.

504
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 That movie is probably the best advertisement that cigarettes have ever had.

505
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 Or at least in the past 40 years.

506
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 But anyways, I love girls who smoke cigarettes.

507
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 I love kissing girls who just smoked a cigarette.

508
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 I think that's like the hottest thing.

509
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 I associate the smell of cigarettes with hot chicks, like are standing outside of a house at 2 a.m.

510
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 And we're talking and we're drunk and she's smoking a cigarette.

511
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 And then we start making out.

512
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 That's how I associate the smell of cigarettes.

513
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 I don't associate them with Phyllis Diller.

514
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,500
 I don't associate the smell of cigarettes with like gross teeth and smelly clothes.

515
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 I associate it as a perfume.

516
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 So I'm wondering if this doll is most likely not haunted.

517
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 Yes, it's most likely a piece of plastic that I bought off eBay that I paid $30 for.

518
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 Thank you, Patreon's also for donating money so I could buy Veronica.

519
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,500
 But if it was going to make the smell of woman's perfume and I walked in and I was like,

520
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 "Is that Eternity by Calvin Klein?"

521
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 I personally don't find that attractive.

522
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 Like I'm not going to kick her out of my bedroom because she smells like she's dropping $120 on some perfume.

523
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 But I would much rather hit up a girl, I see her smoke a cigarette.

524
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
 I'm like, "Hey, what's up?" and she's like, "Ffff."

525
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 Boyfriend just dumped me.

526
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 I'm like, "Oh, really? This is perfect timing.

527
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 I'd much rather be in that situation than be like,

528
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,500
 "Hey, you spent a ton of money to spray a chemical all over your skin.

529
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 Smells good, but you don't smell like a human."

530
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 And she's like, "Why, thank you."

531
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 So who knows, the cigarette smell could be that.

532
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 Most likely not. There's most likely a logical reason why my bedroom I never use smells like cigarettes.

533
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 But that is where we're at right now.
