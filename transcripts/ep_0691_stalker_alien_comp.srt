1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 An old-timey ghost realizes sometimes the best way to hurt somebody is to hurt their pocketbook.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,680
 We say goodbye to a legendary and feared author.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:19,360
 Then we meet a young woman who met her soulmate and couldn't wait to begin a new life with the one

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,680
 she loves the most. But then an alien appeared and told her, "You can't get married today on Dead

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
 Rabbit Radio."

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
 Garmenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys got a

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,120
 lot of cool plans for this weekend. We got so much stuff to cover. First off, let's give a

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
 shout out to our Fan Art Friday submission. This one actually we used to use a lot until we went to

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,640
 the Ash Black logo pretty much across the board and now we're doing the Fan Art Friday. So this

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,080
 is from John. Long time listeners of the show will remember this artwork used to be all over the place.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,680
 So John, thank you so much for... I think on YouTube you'll still see it a lot too, but John,

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
 thank you so much for sending this art in. Really, really appreciate it. And then let's give a shout

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,880
 out to one of our Legacy Patreon supporters, a longtime listener of the show, our Forrest Finn

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
 correspondent coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. It's Beatrice Lava. Everyone give a round of

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,200
 applause to Beatrice. Really, really appreciate your continued support for the show. She's also my

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
 TikTok consultant. I've been trying to do more stuff on TikTok. I'm just limited to the amount of

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,280
 time. I'm not doing dances. Before you guys all go check out the TikTok channel. It's not me doing

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
 Fortnite dances. I'm trying to take episodes and shrink them down to a minute. And I've been really

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,840
 good with it because I know that's what you guys love most. You guys want the episodes to get

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,440
 shorter. I'm taking stories and making them a minute long. Getting really good at it. It's just a

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,600
 matter of time of putting the pictures together and stuff like that. We're gonna do a lot of TikTok

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
 in the future. And Beatrice has really helped out on that front. So Beatrice, let's go ahead and

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,360
 toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,840
 are headed out to North Carolina. Beatrice is expertly flying this vehicle. She's done it before.

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,640
 We're headed out to Caribus County in North Carolina. Specifically, Old Skin Flint's Mine.

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
 This is actually, I think, the last holdover of... I had that ghost theme week. And then it spilled

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 over until the week after it. I was just happy I was able to find all these ghost stories.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,320
 This one also takes place in North Carolina at a mine. I could have all fit him into one week,

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,800
 but it was too much haunted mine for a week. This story is really awesome. I just didn't want you

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,680
 to guys be like, "Oh, me oh, mine." Too many ghost stories. Do you like that? Do you like the Friday

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,600
 puns? John's like, "Give me my artwork back." We're landing in Caribus County the year 1799.

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,120
 And that was when a 12-year-old boy found a big rock in the water. There's a bunch of rocks,

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,720
 but this one was gold and shiny. "Paul, look at what I found. I found this rock." And the dad goes,

35
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,840
 "Oh, that's kind of cool. My kid obviously has some weird fetish for rocks, but we'll deal with

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,640
 that in the future. Right now, why don't we use that rock as a doorstop?" And then one day,

37
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,480
 a dude was walking by and he goes, "That's weird. How come this door has stayed open?"

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,040
 They're like, "Well, if you look down, if you crane your neck down, you'll see there is a door

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,360
 stop there." And the guy goes, "Ooooh." And he realizes this doorstop is a hunk of gold.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,160
 This is when the first gold rush in America started in North Carolina.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,840
 You guys are like, "Jason, you should have given us this information last week when you were talking

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,520
 about all these North Carolina goldmine stories." The problem was that information was in the notes

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,040
 for this story. It wasn't in the notes for those other stories. So this guy goes, "Tell you what,

44
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,480
 I'll give you $3.50 for that doorstop." And the guy's like, "Yeah, sure. That's a lot of money back

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,360
 then. I mean, that's a lot of money right now." And so he pays it, but then eventually the homeowner

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,080
 finds out that that rock, that shiny gold colored rock, was actually gold worth $3,500 in old

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,960
 timey money. So that's like Scrooge McDuck bucks. So eventually he's able to track down the guy.

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,560
 I think he did get some more money for that doorstep. But a bunch of other people started

49
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
 coming into the area of the first major gold rush in American history. North Carolina was the leading

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,520
 producer of gold until 1848 when gold was discovered in California. And people go, "North Carolina,

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,560
 pew! This place sucks!" But before people realized that North Carolina wasn't where it's at,

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,600
 you had people from all over the world come to North Carolina to try to strike it rich.

53
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,320
 They didn't have a rule, though. No slaves were allowed. No slaves. This is interesting. I didn't

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,120
 have thought about this because if you thought, think about it. The gold rush was during slavery

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,400
 times. California wasn't a slave state, but North Carolina wasn't. They had a rule. No slaves were

56
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,600
 allowed in the mine because they were afraid that they would hide gold. Can you believe this?

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
 They were afraid that slaves would try to purchase their freedom, try to purchase their freedom and

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,720
 the freedom of their friends and family by finding gold and then coming back out of the cave and

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
 being like, "I don't work for you anymore. You have a big chunk of gold." They couldn't allow it.

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,320
 They couldn't allow these people to actually, you know, be people. So no slaves were allowed. So

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,480
 they had to import labor from around the world and people wanted to come. They wanted to try to

62
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:37,760
 make money. Enter Jonathan McIntosh. He's the owner of the McIntosh mine. 450 foot deep mine.

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,720
 It seems to be doing pretty well. Lots of gold is coming out of it, but it's not enough for Jonathan

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,680
 McIntosh because despite him saying, "Oh, we got the best timber in the world. We got the best,

65
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,520
 we got the best other stuff that makes a mine function. You want dynamite? Our dynamite is

66
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,080
 dynamite." Everyone in the mine knew that Jonathan was a liar. They'd go down there and they'd see

67
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,320
 the wood. It wasn't rotting, but he would use very, very new timber. So it wasn't strong enough.

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
 He had seen that dynamite explode and they weren't impressed. It was just like regular dynamite.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
 They knew that Jonathan was selling them a bill of goods. Like he wasn't actually

70
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,800
 putting money into the mine, which you don't go down there to be bedazzled, right? They weren't

71
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
 worried about the fact that it wasn't the jazziest place to work. They weren't about their own safety.

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,200
 They could tell he was cutting corners. So people were like, "I don't know." So as the mine got deeper

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,360
 and deeper, it was harder to find people to go down there. There's a local miner named Joe McGee.

74
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
 He's an expert. He's been doing this all of his life. The first tunnel he crawled out of was his

75
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,880
 mother and he hasn't stopped crawling through tunnels since. And he knows reputation of McIntosh

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,280
 Mine. It is not safe. But no one else is going deep into the mine. Jonathan calls up Joe and says,

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,760
 "Hey, listen. I got a deal for you. You go into my super safe mine at the deepest point and start

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,480
 digging and doing your mine magic and then everyone else will go down to join you because

79
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,520
 you're such a cool guy, Joe. You're so cool. Everyone will follow you." And Joe goes, "Listen,

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,560
 I know the story is your mine is not safe. You cut a bunch of corners, but I will do it. However,

81
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,640
 if I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000." Today would be the equivalent of about $30,000. So it's

82
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,160
 pretty good life insurance policy. Actually, that's kind of lame for life insurance policy.

83
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,280
 Anyways, Joe goes, "If I go down there and I die, you have to pay my wife $1,000." And Jonathan

84
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,200
 was kind of shocked. How dare he say his mine isn't safe? What are you talking about? I mean,

85
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,360
 I don't go down there myself. I wouldn't let any of my friends and family down there. But

86
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
 it's totally safe. And in fact, it's so safe. I want you to know if you die, whatever that is,

87
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,160
 I'll give your wife $2,000. Joe goes into the mine. A couple days pass. Hey, you don't remember

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
 that guy, Joe? We used to kick it with all the time. He was a really good miner and all that stuff.

89
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,480
 Yeah, yeah. Have you seen him lately? Uh-uh, no, I thought he was hanging out with you. No,

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,600
 I wish he was pretty cool. A couple weeks go by. Hey, dude, what are you doing, man? Oh,

91
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,480
 sorry, I thought you were Joe. I thought you were super cool. I don't really care about you.

92
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,400
 But speaking of Joe, have you seen him? No, dude, no one's seen Joe for weeks. Not even his wife.

93
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,480
 Joe must have left. That's the only thing when you think of, I mean, we do know that he's working

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,120
 in a super dangerous industry, but maybe he just left and left his wife. Oh, okay. Now,

95
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,800
 nobody knew about this arrangement, this life insurance arrangement, except for Joe's wife.

96
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,240
 And Joe's wife went to Jonathan McIntosh and said, "Hey, you know, pretty sure my husband's dead.

97
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,040
 He's not going to run away. He was in your mind and he told me that he told you. He could only do

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,280
 it, you know, the thousand, you know, rewind the podcast a little bit, remember that part?"

99
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,200
 And Jonathan goes, "Oh, I did say that, but he didn't die. Nobody's found his body

100
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,680
 and he probably just left you. You're kind of busted. You're kind of busted and he left you,

101
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,960
 so I don't have to give you any money. It was if he died, I gave you the money,

102
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,800
 not if he like cheated on you or something like that. Slams the door in her face.

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,120
 One night, a minor who was also a good friend of Joe, here's a knock on his door.

104
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,080
 And standing there is Joe McGee's ghost. He thought it was just Joe McGee. He thought he just

105
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,360
 really cheated on his wife. No, it was his ghost and he's floating there. He doesn't say if he has

106
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,400
 Casper legs. Doesn't say if he's eating a bunch of hot dogs like Slimer, but he is. He's inventing

107
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,000
 the hot dogs so he can eat them. He's floating there and he tells his friend, "Hey, dude, you won't

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,560
 believe what happened to me." The friend's like, "Let me guess, you died?" Yes. What was the giveaway?

109
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,280
 The fact that I have Casper legs? Why do I keep saying Casper legs? Casper actually had legs,

110
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,320
 but you know what I mean? Like a little wavy ghost body. He's like, "Listen, forget that anachronism.

111
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,280
 Forget what's going on with that host." I died in the mine, dude. I went down there and that

112
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,840
 jerk Jonathan had fresh timbers, like the freshest. Like these were amoeba trees down there and they

113
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,760
 collapsed. I was killed in the mine. Joe says, "Listen, I'm gonna tell you where my body's at in the

114
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,440
 mine so maybe you can give me a proper burial. I mean, I am buried. I am buried by tons of rock,

115
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,360
 but you know, bury me in the soil where it's a little nicer." And, "Hey, do you know? I don't know

116
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
 if I told you about this. I probably should have told more people about this, but I arranged for

117
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,280
 a life insurance policy. Did my wife ever get any money?" And the friend goes, "No." He didn't. The

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:03,360
 ghost is like, "Ahh, Dagnabbit." Then he just turns and he slowly floats away. It's interesting that

119
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,480
 he didn't go visit his wife, right? It's interesting that he goes and visits his friend and asks him

120
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,520
 all this stuff. He could have went to his wife first or last even. I mean, like, "Hey, honey, I'm not

121
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,240
 home. I'm just the ghost. But hey, did you get that money? Also, I love you." Like, he never visits

122
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,800
 his wife, but he does visit this dude. But before he floats away, he turns back around because I

123
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
 forgot to see until I read a little bit more of my notes. He turns around, he goes, "And

124
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:39,680
 I cursed the Macintosh mind forever, forever, forever, forever." And then he gets tired of saying that. He

125
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,840
 says it for like 30, 40 minutes. Then he turns around and floats away. Jonathan's minor friend gets

126
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,920
 some other minors together. They confront Macintosh. They go to his house and this basically formed a

127
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,800
 lynch mob and they want to know what's going on. Jonathan admits to this. He says, "Yes, okay. Oh,

128
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,920
 you got me. You got me my bad. I sent this expert minor down in the mineshaft and yeah,

129
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,480
 sure, the timber might have been a little new." And he died and I realized that he died pretty

130
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,480
 early on. So I did the noble thing. I just told everyone he was a cheater and he left his wife.

131
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:22,320
 And he is forced to give the wife this $2,000. And the minors were able to go down and locate

132
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:32,080
 Joe's body and give it a proper burial. Into the story, right? Not as far as Joe's concerned.

133
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,720
 Because what happens is minors are still working in that mine. They're like, "Yeah,

134
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
 the guy did. The owner of this mine did murder someone and tried to rip off his widow. But,

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 you know, works, work." As they're working in this mine, they would see Joe's ghost floating through

136
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:57,600
