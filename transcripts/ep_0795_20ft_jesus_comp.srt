1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 What would you do if you were attending a group meeting and all of a sudden a new reality emerged?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,360
 And then we meet a young man who has a bizarre story to tell from his childhood

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,100
 Where he saw someone display supernatural powers right in front of him

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:24,200
 Is it possible that what this boy witnessed was real or is the answer far more tragic?

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,520
 And then we meet another young man myself as a little boy

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,120
 One day I was sneaking around a cemetery and I

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
 met

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,080
 Jesus today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your Jason Garvin or I'm having a great day

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,560
 So we're gonna get started right away first off. Let's bring in our pilot from yesterday

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,600
 He didn't get to fly the carpenter copter and I want to make sure everyone flies the carpenter copter one of our Thanksgiving

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,080
 Livestream supporters give it up once more for an idea guy everyone give a round of applause for an idea guy

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the show financially through the patreon or through livestream donations

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,760
 That's totally fine. Just help spread the word about the show that really really helps out a lot now idea guy

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
 Let's go ahead and start you off in the Jason Jalopy

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,240
 We're gonna touch you the keys to that bad boy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 We're driving all the way out to a

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,000
 group meeting

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,520
 Know that's a very general location

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
 There's group meetings going on at all times in all places

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,400
 But we don't have a lot of details of when and where this story took place

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,000
 Which are kind of essential for any sort of journalism

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,760
 We need to know at least that but when we're dealing with the paranormal a lot of people are very shy

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,960
 And they don't want to have their identity revealed

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,800
 So we're gonna read this story on this very popular podcast so everyone can hear it

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,600
 But yeah, I wish I had more details for it, but for right now we're at a group meeting

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,520
 So we're just sitting there and we're eating chips. It's over eaters anonymous

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,400
 We're like oops and then the group meeting starts and we're gonna be joined by this young person. Let's call her

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,200
 Terry it's just a stab in the dark. That's your real name

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,080
 Terry is sitting there as well and Terry is watching this group meeting going on

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,280
 They also left out why they're at the group meeting

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,920
 We don't know it could be something fun like a group meeting for building a quilt for the community

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,280
 Or it could be something absolutely horrible that we don't want to be photographed as we leave in this meeting

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,600
 But Terry is sitting at this group meeting and the speaker is standing in the middle of the circle and she's wearing the speakers a woman

36
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,720
 She's wearing brown slacks. She's there either. She's like, oh, this isn't one of those weird pervo support groups

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,840
 Or do I hmm if she has on a leather gear underneath her brown slacks

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,760
 Terry sitting there Terry sitting there and watching the speaker give this presentation and then

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
 a

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
 Cut in reality appears

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
 Terry says that you could see a

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,320
 slice a silvery shiny slice

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,840
 Appear in the space in front of the speaker from her belly button

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:25,240
 Curving down over to her hip and then down to her knee. It's this silvery slice in what appears to be

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,640
 reality

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
 And

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,680
 Terry's like mesmerized by this and is looking is can't figure out why no one else is saying anything and

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,800
 she's looking at the slice in reality and

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,840
 It's bigger now. It's a wider slice and Terry goes the speaker was wearing brown slacks

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,000
 But when I'm looking through the slice

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,480
 The speaker was wearing a skirt

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,720
 With the hound's tooth pattern

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:06,440
 That's the whole story

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
 That's the whole story

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,760
 That's a little story, but I find no monsters popped out. She didn't turn into a leather Dom

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,480
 She ripped off all her clothes. She's whipping everyone. They're like, it's over eaters anonymous quit whipping us. We're not in a crazy sex

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,360
 I found this post online by a poster known as Alium spaceship

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,640
 And that's really the end of the story and sometimes a lot of times actually I have to say these are my

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,860
 Favorite stories not because they're short. I can tell five of them in an episode

60
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,080
 It's because usually I read a ton of this stuff and I can usually start to suss out what's real and what's fake

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
 Depending on how dramatic they are. I was reading a story last night

62
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,200
 I'll see if I can find it put in the show notes

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,860
 But this kid was running around the house and like this demon was trying to rape him and he's like come at me

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,480
 You homo demon. He's like beating it up and stuff like that and demons like all get your butthole next time

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,640
 And I'm like none of this happened none of this happened

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,600
 None of this like I know

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
 I've been in the game for 30 years that did not happen and

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,800
 It's the stories where they just kind of end especially when they're in a

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,720
 Like usually when people get abducted by aliens stuff can get really wacky

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,480
 But this kid like was like I think stuff was hitting on the back of the head like all this stuff's

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,960
 Levitating around and trying to go in his butthole and I was like what if not this is not real

72
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
 This is obviously a parody or

73
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,680
 This guy is thinks he's gonna fool us. Oh, this guy is completely insane

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,160
 I hope I saved it. I really hope I saved it. I wasn't gonna cover it. I was like, oh, this is nonsense

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,320
 But so this is how paranormal stuff actually happens for a lot of the people, right?

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
 You're sitting there and you see something weird and you're like, huh?

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,440
 And then you try to explain it and if you can't explain it

78
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,640
 It goes into your unexplained file and your brain and then maybe years later you post about it online searching for an answer

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,600
 I remember once I was taking a video editing class. This is way back in the day. We're actually using two VCRs

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,880
 This is back like in the 90s and I got dropped off there by my mom

81
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,680
 I wasn't a dolt but my mom dropped me off at this video editing class at at the adult learning center in Rancho Cordova

82
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,880
 Or wherever and I saw a man in the distance being beat up by two demons

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,000
 Not not fans of the San Francisco demons the XFL team

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,560
 I remember is really late the class was late

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,280
 It was dark and I see a man in the distance of this dark parking lot and I could see two shadowy figures next to him

86
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
 Pushing them around and I could see him kind of stumbling

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,640
 He'd like kind of look like he was gonna lose his his footing and then he'd regain it

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,920
 But he was definitely struggling against these two large black masses and they had no humanly features

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,360
 They were just huge and they kept pushing him from side to side and I'm watching this and I go

90
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,160
 Oh that guy looks like he's being beat up by shadow. They're not trying to get in his butthole and

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,440
 Had I then been picked up by my mom or had I then walked because I watched this for a couple minutes

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,660
 I love this guy get beat up by these demons these shadow in for a while. I'm sitting there

93
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,240
 Had I gone in

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 Early had my mom picked me up or whatever. I wouldn't have waited another minute or two

95
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,600
 Until he got close enough to me and I could see he was carrying these two giant vacuum cleaners

96
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,240
 Like these industrial vacuum cleaners

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,240
 He was holding them up and kind of trying to wobble them and sometimes he'd put one down so I would see his weight shifting

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,520
 That's what it was. All I saw was the giant vacuum bags of big black bags and at the distance in the dark

99
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
 I it just looked like

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,600
 Non-descript shapes attacking this guy. I should also note if you haven't already picked up at no point

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,780
 Did I think about rendering assistance to this man? I'm like dude if you're gonna beat up my demons

102
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,400
 You probably probably did something to deserve it

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,680
 Or not and I'm just lazy so I'm sitting there and I go

104
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
 Oh, well, I didn't go ask him here

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,440
 Are you getting beat up by demons cuz it was too vacuum cleaner so but think about it that story could have easily ended up in my

106
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,760
 mysterious folder in my brain

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,920
 Stuff that's happened

108
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 So I can see like again. That's a fairly mundane story

109
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,600
 It would have been mundane if the demons are actually beating them up and then like a portal hell shows up

110
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,400
 He's like you could have saved me. Oh, I'm you from the future. I was like, what was that last part?

111
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,880
 Paranormal stories just a lot of times just go and then we don't know what happened

112
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,920
 And I enjoy stories like that because they this sounds realistic now

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,880
 Obviously, she could have been having a nervous breakdown. This could have been we don't know what the group is it could be hallucinators anonymous

114
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,100
 But it's just fascinating

115
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:37,120
 We talk all about alternate universes and parallel dimensions and things like that and this would be one of those small

116
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 Differences that really don't make at any change in reality or like it's not a groundbreaking change

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,600
 Whether or not she wears brown pants or the hounds tooth skirt

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
 It's just again a creepy thing and in the middle of the day

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,960
 You're seeing something that can't be explained and no one else can see it and that really takes us into the next two stories

120
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,920
 We're gonna talk about so an idea guy. Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of that carboner copter or leave me behind this group meeting

121
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
 We are headed all the way out

122
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,080
 To a young boys house

123
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,800
 I found this story posted on the export the other day and this is kind of the theme

124
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,120
 This is what the original poster put up and they were talking about childhood memories. We're gonna take a look at this young man's memory

125
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
 We're gonna call him

126
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,400
 DJ

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,040
 Now DJ he tells the story. He goes you won't believe what happened to me

128
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,520
 I was about nine or ten years old and my parents are out of town for the week

129
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,360
 I couldn't watch myself. I was too young so they get my uncle

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,400
 So to babysit me for a week and he goes do my uncle is super cool. He was a really dope dude to hang out with and

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,120
 He was six foot eight and

132
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,000
 400 pounds

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,020
 I'm pretty sure his uncle was actually bigfoot and they had some family fun adventure and they like stopped an evil developer from like

134
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,020
 Paving over their house to put up a mall or something like that

135
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,520
 But actually that probably would have been preferable to what might have happened in this story. So this dude he's six foot eight

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,680
 He's 400 pounds. He's uncle will call him Uncle Joe and one day DJ sitting there and he's playing video games

137
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,000
 And Uncle Joe walks into the living room and he goes hey

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
 Hey, DJ, did you know I can levitate?

139
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,920
 And DJ doesn't believe him right? He's still sitting there. He's playing perfect dark or whatever

140
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,440
 I don't know when this story takes place either, but he's playing these video games and Uncle Joe goes

141
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 I can levitate and he's like trying to convince

142
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,680
 DJ that he can levitate finally DJs like okay, whatever you obviously want to show me something. I don't believe it's possible

143
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,280
 I'm nine. I'm not an idiot humans can't levitate

144
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,120
 But sure whatever and he turns around and he watches uncle Joe stand there all six foot eight of him

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,280
 Standing there in the room and he starts to strain really hard

146
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,680
 Lifts his right foot up off the ground

147
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,960
 I'm doing it. I'm doing it DJ DJs like what are you talking about?

148
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,680
 I can clearly see you just have lifted one foot up off the ground and Uncle Joe goes no no

149
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,120
 Check get down there and check

150
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,080
 I'm levitating DJ and

151
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,160
 DJ bends over in front of his uncle and he gets down there and he looks and

152
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,920
 sure enough

153
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,720
 Both his feet are off the ground by a good six inches

154
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,680
 He's looking under his feet and he can see his uncle Joe is indeed levitating

155
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:43,960
 He looks up and his uncle is just standing there and

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,280
 His arms aren't holding on to anything

157
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,640
 He was looking to see if maybe he was bracing himself against something

158
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,840
 But he looked up and know his uncle is just standing there

159
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,240
 Floating

160
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,760
 DJ gets down and he's looking at his feet and Uncle Joe was perfectly still it's not like he's wobbling

161
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,400
 It's not he's trying to balance. He's perfectly still floating in midair six inches off the ground

162
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,480
 Oh

163
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,600
 There's a loud thud as the levitation trick whatever it was ends and

164
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,480
 Uncle Joe is now back on the ground

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,000
 Do it again do it again DJ says no no we're done with that

166
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,640
 You gotta cut you're not gonna do it again. No. No just that one time levitating

167
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,200
 Can you show me how to do it? No

168
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,520
 It's over

169
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
 He never showed DJ how he pulled the trick off

170
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,600
 He never did the trick again for DJ and whenever DJ would bring it up

171
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,220
 His uncle would just dodge the questions and he goes nowadays it mean my uncle. We still talk

172
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,240
 Probably once a year we bring it up. It's like an inside joke. Hey uncle remember when you were levitating

173
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,840
 The uncle's eyes are darting from side to side

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,760
 So here's the thing this is a really interesting story and

175
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,520
 The third comment down

176
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,680
 I think kind of summed up what my feelings were when I read it and this is gonna get dark real quick

177
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,720
 But I'm reading and here's the thing. I am an aficionado of the paranormal

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,600
 I believe that people do have abilities outside of the norm. I believe they're super rare

179
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,320
 But I believe there are people who have abilities that someone consider unnatural

180
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,160
 So that is what I have on one hand on the other hand and reading the story and I'm like

181
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,520
 and

182
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,280
 Maybe like two or three comments down someone said

183
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,480
 This sounds like a quote

184
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,840
 Obviously impossible false memory to cover up super mega rape

185
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,680
 unquote and

186
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
 I remember when I read that I go

187
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,800
 Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking too. It's super bizarre. Isn't it like

188
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,080
 You're the weird one and so is that guy
