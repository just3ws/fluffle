1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Has the story of a creepy photo been explained?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,480
 That doesn't sound intriguing, but bear with me.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,480
 And then we look at the history of killer meteors.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,080
 What is their body count?

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,880
 How much destruction have they laid waste to the planet?

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
 And could it happen again today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,840
 [music]

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,600
 I hope you're having a great day too.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 It's been a little cold.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,240
 It's been a little cold.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,960
 If you're a long time listener to this podcast, you know it started off with me complaining

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,600
 about the heat, but it's getting kind of chilly up here.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,680
 And I can't run my heater during the podcast, but this is something that I expected to happen.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,920
 I do want to bring notice.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
 We're getting used to the new website, we.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,000
 Me, I always say we, it's the royal we, it's me.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,440
 I'm still getting used to the new website setup.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,760
 And I'm trying to figure out a way to get this new image to appear on the website.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
 Grant Scott is a listener of the podcast.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,840
 He drew this amazing Dead Rabbit picture, icon image.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,040
 It's just this, it's kind of even hard to describe, but it's absolutely amazing.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 It's definitely going to be up.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,200
 We're going to start using it into the YouTube videos, but I want the podcast listeners to

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
 be able to see it as well.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,080
 We're still going to keep Ash Black's Dead Rabbit logo, the red black and blue one that

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,680
 you've seen with the third eye.

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,760
 I love that.

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
 That's great.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,080
 It's just kind of a logo for the show.

33
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,560
 And I appreciate that Ash Black made that for us.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
 We're still using that.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
 Grant Scott's image.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,680
 We're going to work into the YouTube videos because I think just the size of it, it's so

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
 detailed.

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
 You want to get the full view of it.

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,100
 And I, if things work out the way I want them to, we should be seeing stickers with both

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
 of those appear on it in the future.

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,960
 So Grant Scott and Ash Black, thank you so much for making that artwork.

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,120
 Means a lot to me that you guys really went out of your way to design that.

43
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,920
 So I mean, it means a lot to me.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 It really does.

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,120
 So let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,200
 I was going to talk about my dad's email, but it wasn't funny.

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
 I was reading them again.

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,760
 Basically it had to do with Grant Scott's artwork.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,200
 I sent my dad the artwork to say, "Hey, look what this guy made me."

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,840
 And my dad's like, "Uh, yeah, cool."

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,400
 And I was like, "What?

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
 That's a weird response from my father.

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,040
 Like, he's very supportive in general."

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,920
 And then I thought about it for a couple of days.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm like, "That's kind of an odd response."

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
 So I emailed him back and I was like, "Yeah, you know, it's really cool.

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
 This guy sent it to me.

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,720
 The podcast is going great.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
 The YouTube channel is blowing up."

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,920
 And then he emails me back and he says, "Good.

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,120
 You deserve a bit of success because you're so smart and knowledgeable."

62
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,600
 And I'm thinking, "Did he mean every bit of success or is he just telling me I only need,

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,920
 I only deserve a bit of it?

64
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,280
 I only deserve a bit of success.

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,480
 Not every bit of success.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
 I'm assuming dad is a typo.

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,360
 He doesn't listen to the podcast, but I'm assuming it was a typo and you mean I deserve

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,880
 every success I get.

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,880
 But if it's not, if you actually think that I only deserve a bit of success, I'll take

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 it.

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
 I love my dad.

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
 I love my family.

73
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 My mom.

74
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
 I just got off the phone with my mom, actually.

75
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,960
 So let's go ahead and jump into the story.

76
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,840
 Since I basically told you I wasn't going to tell you a story and then told you it anyways,

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,040
 that's just the way it works sometimes.

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
 Let's go ahead and hop into the episode.

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,040
 So I know it's difficult to talk about a photo on a podcast, but I have to address this

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
 photo.

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,800
 This photo is so scary.

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,720
 This is a photo that I actually saw probably around the time it first came out.

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,680
 It first started appearing on the internet back in 2009.

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,560
 It's known as the Cooper Family Photo.

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,040
 It is chilling.

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,720
 So what it is, it's like two women and two little boys.

87
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,240
 And they're sitting around a table and there's like little candles.

88
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,440
 They're all dressed in like 1950s clothes.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,240
 It's black and white.

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,400
 The photo, not the clothes.

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
 Well, the clothes are too, but.

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:09,280
 And then to the left of the picture is the body of a man, supposedly falling from the

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,360
 ceiling completely covered in black.

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,600
 You just kind of see the white of its sleeves, its face is completely obscured in black and

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,320
 it's just kind of like, it looks, okay, what it looks like is that somebody was trying

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,200
 to snap a photo and a man jumping off of a building photo bummed it.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:35,280
 So we're watching this guy fall in the photo, but the family sitting there don't even acknowledge

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
 the person's there.

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,960
 So I'll put it in the show notes.

100
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,940
 You'll see it on the YouTube channel.

101
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,120
 And I know that's a bad way to start this segment, but it's a really, really creepy photo.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
 It's creepy on several levels.

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,680
 One, it's creepy because it's an old photo and old photos are just intrinsically creepy.

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,200
 Two, the fact that we can't see a lot of detail on the falling figure.

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,320
 Well, I guess two, the one, the ultimate one should be like there's a dude falling into

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,040
 a photo and no one's reacting to it.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,360
 And I remember the first time I saw that photo, I had like a visceral reaction to it.

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,560
 I remember like almost reacting and disgust.

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,540
 I was like, Oh my God, that's terrifying.

110
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,260
 And there was no story behind it.

111
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,180
 It was just this photo that was going around the internet.

112
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,460
 And again, the fact that they aren't reacting to it is just adds to the creepiness.

113
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:28,620
 If they were like, ooh, like, you know, looking at it and shrieking away in fear, we'd see

114
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,580
 their reactions, I think would kind of dull it maybe.

115
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,860
 But the fact that they're still just kind of doing that weird and 1950 stare at the camera

116
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,800
 like you don't have a soul look.

117
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,400
 And there's this horrible thing happening right next to them.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,240
 Supposedly paranormal thing.

119
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,800
 In 2013, so the post, the picture first posted was really cited online in 2009.

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,760
 On 2013, it finally got a backstory.

121
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,320
 The weird thing is, is it got two separate backstories on the same day, different parts

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
 of the world.

123
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,280
 So it had two different forums in two different countries on the same day.

124
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,500
 We got two different stories behind the origin of this photo.

125
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,660
 Story one was, as the Coopers move into their new home in Texas, they take a photograph

126
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,680
 of the family sitting together.

127
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,220
 But as the photo is taken, a body falls through the ceiling.

128
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,900
 The OP said he wasn't sure if it was real, but he thought it was really creepy.

129
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,380
 So in that version of the story, that it basically was a photo bomb.

130
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,380
 Someone was taking a picture of body falls through the ceiling and the moment is taken

131
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,080
 and they're like, "Oh my god, there's a body on the ground.

132
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,760
 Oh no, what happened?"

133
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,920
 The second story, which again appeared on the same day, different forum.

134
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,160
 The Cooper family has just moved into their new home in Texas.

135
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,000
 In honor of the housewarming was laid festive table.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,560
 Okay, so I guess I should have read this more closely.

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,800
 When I said these were posted in different forums in different countries, this one was

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,840
 obviously not posted in a country where English is their first language.

139
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
 So let's go ahead and take another look at this.

140
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,060
 In honor of the housewarming was laid festive table, at the same time decided to make some

141
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,500
 family photos.

142
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,740
 And when the pictures showed, they showed a strange figure.

143
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,580
 It seems that someone's body is either hanging down or falling from the ceiling.

144
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,340
 Of course, nothing like this during the shooting, Cooper's did not see.

145
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,740
 So, you know, despite the fact that Yoda apparently wrote that blog post, I think it's apparent

146
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,200
 that this story says that it was something paranormal, that the people who were sitting

147
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,480
 at the table did not see anything there.

148
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,120
 One group was formed to only debunk this photo.

149
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,900
 They said, "Let's get these people together.

150
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,800
 We're going to find out that this photo is fake."

151
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
 So they started, these researchers were all over looking, trying to figure out a way,

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,760
 saying, "Oh, the lighting's off, the shadows off," something like that.

153
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,640
 Eventually someone joined the forum and said, "I'm the boy in the photo.

154
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,680
 I'm that kid.

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
 And here's proof."

156
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,580
 And this guy sent in photos of himself as a kid at that table.

157
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,740
 Same candles, all sorts of stuff.

158
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,820
 This guy's name was Robert Copper.

159
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,660
 So the original story was that it was the Cooper family, but it turns out that this was the

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,380
 Copper family.

161
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,820
 So Robert Copper, and that's a little weird that the names are so close.

162
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,420
 Robert Copper, this is what he said.

163
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
 This is his quote here.

164
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,360
 When my older brother sent me to this link, I was floored, "We are the two boys in the

165
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
 picture."

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,640
 Well, we were back in 1959.

167
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,720
 I have many pictures like this one, but not this one.

168
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,880
 My mother had a habit of throwing away pictures that she didn't like.

169
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,040
 Eventually the ones she kept were passed along to me.

170
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,560
 What annoys me is that somebody got hold of a family photo.

171
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,800
 The story is almost entirely fiction.

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,280
 Our last name is Copper, not Cooper.

173
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,920
 Does anybody know who did this?

174
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,340
 So then they're like, "Okay, so we have this guy."

175
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,700
 He said that he was at this table.

176
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
 This never happened.

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,860
 He never saw the original photo.

178
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,180
 This is all fake.

179
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,140
 It's bendy-bunked.

180
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,020
 And then they go and plus the shadows and the lights and all that type of stuff.

181
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,140
 And one thing they said, the person falling is taking the pose of a ballerina.

182
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,740
 So they're thinking somebody took a photo of an old-timey ballerina, obscured it a bit,

183
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,260
 turned it upside down, and they said that's why the necklace on the falling figure is not

184
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,700
 falling with the figure.

185
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,440
 It's because it's an upright picture turned upside down.

186
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,320
 So case closed, right?

187
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
 I don't think so.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,760
 Now you might call me a contrarian because I usually like to debunk stuff, but I think

189
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
 this photo might be real.

190
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
 And here's why.

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,920
 I think in Copper's story we're given hints.

192
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
 Now here's the thing.

193
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,080
 It's totally possible that it's a slender man style creepypasta photo that was created

194
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,640
 and got loose from its creator.

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,400
 But I don't think so.

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,180
 He said that this is a photo of him and his brother.

197
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:56,020
 He said that his mom would throw away photos she didn't like.

198
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,300
 She had a habit of doing this.

199
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,900
 Now if you're going through all the photos you have and you found this one falling down

200
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,860
 this horrible creature falling down in a photo with your kids and you had a habit of throwing

201
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,740
 photos away, do you think you'd keep this one?

202
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,340
 Now we may because we're into this type of stuff.

203
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,920
 But if you're a 1950s housewife and you're like "Ugh" you just toss it.

204
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,200
 Because he doesn't know.

205
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,240
 The photo is at least partially real.

206
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,080
 We can argue over whether or not the fallen figure is real, but the photo itself is real.

207
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,160
 And he's saying how did this photo get out of my possession or my mother's possession

208
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,580
 and it would have been had to been held on for this whole long time and then someone would

209
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,720
 have photoshopped this guy in.

210
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,680
 What if she did throw it away and someone retrieved it and thought this is a creepy photo

211
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,340
 and they didn't throw it away, it was in their collection for a long time and eventually

212
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,020
 their grandson finds it and scans it into the computer and throws it online because it's

213
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,420
 super creepy to look at.

214
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,420
 I think it's weird that the name is close enough, Copper and Cooper, so it wasn't a wild

215
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
 guess.

216
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,100
 I think it's also weird that both stories took place in the same state, Texas.

217
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,460
 There's no clues in the picture that it's from Texas.

218
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,660
 Again, it could just be that it is a slender man level creepypasta and everyone was in

219
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,020
 on it and Robert Copper was like "Whoa, whoa.

220
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,800
 You guys are messing with my life."

221
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,600
 But I think his story actually gives more credibility to the fact that it is real.

222
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,520
 I think the fact that he admits that she would throw photos away, that it was in a sense

223
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,480
 partially a true photo, it wasn't photoshopped out of a bunch of little things.

224
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,040
 And the complaints about the lighting, the shadowing not being right, the necklace not

225
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,880
 falling down, my pushback is on, this is probably going to come to bite me later on when I tried

226
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,660
 debunking another ghost story.

227
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,540
 But I don't know if ghosts or demons or whatever would cast the same type of shadows.

228
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,740
 And you go Jason, light's light and it's going to bend around the same way.

229
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,340
 But I mean if we accept that there is something from another dimension or something that's

230
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:04,580
 from coming from the other side and they can see but yet they're also like invisible most

231
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,220
 of the time and they can pass through walls.

232
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,060
 Technically, their eyes can't accept light in for them to see.

233
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,860
 So maybe light affects them differently.

234
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
 I don't know.

235
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:20,320
 I think it's hard to look at a photo of a ghost, of a presumed ghost and say the shadows

236
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,160
 are wrong, the lighting is wrong.

237
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,400
 Because you're dealing with something that is paranormal.

238
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,360
 Now there could be other stuff where you're like no we can see the pixels, we can see

239
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,760
 where this is clearly been photoshopped, we can look at the negative, here's the original

240
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
 photo.

241
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,240
 There's other ways to disprove a ghost photo.

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,640
 But I think by saying things like I think it's the lighting, I think it's the shadows,

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,140
 I don't think that really works.

244
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,980
 These guys are still working on this by the way.

245
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,460
 They're still trying to debunk this photo but they're leaning far more towards the fact

246
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,260
 that somebody took it and photoshopped this guy in because they said it kind of looks

247
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,980
 like this ballerina and so on and so forth.

248
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,260
 But again, I'm not so sure.

249
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
 I'm not so sure.

250
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,940
 This might actually be a real ghost photo.

251
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,300
 I'm not going to put money on it or anything because it may not be.

252
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,620
 But again there's something about it that if it is made up, it's a very very creepy.

253
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,400
 creepy mockup of an otherwise serene event.

254
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 I don't know.

255
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,920
 I would probably say, I mean the logical side of me says yes it's a hoax but that emotional

256
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,800
 side of me goes there's just something too creepy about it for it to just be a photoshopped

257
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 job.

258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,960
 But I've been fooled before.

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,920
 So I mean you know I'm not infallible.

260
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,080
 It would be interesting to know though like Robert Copper said how did the person get

261
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,180
 one of his family photos?

262
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,620
 Photoshop it supposedly and put it online.

263
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,220
 That oh dude a witch took it a witch.

264
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,540
 That's what we talked about our last episode.

265
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,780
 If photos go missing that means there is a witch.

266
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,580
 Robert Copper, do you know Kim Kardashian?

267
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,940
 We need to know that.

268
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,220
 Okay full disclosure I was just getting the artwork prepped for this episode and I took

269
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,040
 another look at the debunking website and they actually named this artist.

270
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,580
 His name is Thomas Legoti and it appears that he's the original one who posted the photo.

271
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,200
 So if what's weird about it is that they're saying that this guy posted the photo and

272
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,280
 this guy is an artist.

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,400
 Looking at his other art nothing really matches this but they all seem to kind of brush over

274
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
 that and spend more time talking about shadows and stuff.

275
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:36,620
 So I don't know if this artist is taking responsibility for making the photo or for simply posting

276
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,780
 being the first to post it.

277
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,060
 All the comments are closed on the forum for the photo.

278
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,460
 So I don't know it was weird.

279
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,620
 I must have brushed over that when I first was reading all the debunking stuff but I

280
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,460
 did come across that so that makes it lean more towards it being fake.

281
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,620
 But and that kind of throws off my theory on it but again I wanted to let you guys know

282
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,680
 that because some of you guys do click through the links or already know the subject and

283
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
 be like "hey you missed that" and I wanted to go ahead and get that out there.

284
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,700
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story where the audio quality will most likely be

285
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
 different.

286
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,660
 Okay so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

287
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,620
 Now our next story is something that I think everyone's thought about at least once or

288
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
 twice.

289
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,400
 Me I think about it all the time.

290
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,720
 I always imagine for whatever reason I'm walking on the street or I'm sitting at work

291
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,060
 or I'm sitting at home and I imagine a meteorite, like a just you know a small one, you know

292
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,940
 maybe about the size of a baked potato crashing through my house and just blowing me up.

293
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,300
 I don't know why I have that and it's not like a bad thought, it's not like I'm worried

294
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,540
 about it but I always think "dude what if I was sitting right now, sitting here right

295
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,700
 now" and just *pfff* just like it obliterated by because a meteorite the size of a potato

296
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,620
 would probably just disintegrate my torso.

297
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,960
 And sometimes when I'm in a more jovial mood I'll think "dude what if a nickel sized meteorite

298
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,960
 like crashes into me but it doesn't kill me but gives me superpowers" and then I get

299
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,240
 to daydream about having meteorite based superpowers.

300
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:23,720
 So anyways I do enjoy the idea of meteorites crashing into the planet.

301
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,620
 And the giant ones obviously scare me.

302
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,820
 Meteorites hit the planet all the time.

303
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,660
 The planet actually weighs more each year because of meteorite strikes.

304
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,860
 There's enough to keep adding to the mass of the planet.

305
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
 We don't see them.

306
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,820
 Like most of them are rock based so you'd be walking on the street and you'd just see

307
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,020
 a rock in the grass and you'd think "oh that's a rock but for all you know it was a meteorite

308
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,220
 that crashed a thousand years ago" or two days ago.

309
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,820
 They say when you go to Antarctica you can literally just see meteorites all over the

310
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,920
 place because you'll just see ice, you'll just see snow and then you'll see a rock

311
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,960
 just sitting on top of it or in the middle of it and they're like "oh that was an asteroid."

312
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
 It's a meteorite strike.

313
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,720
 So it does happen but the earth is so big and people are so spread out for the most part

314
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,240
 and the oceans take up a huge chunk of the planet that we have a very low likelihood of

315
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,120
 being killed by a meteor.

316
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,880
 Very very rare.

317
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
 But it is possible.

318
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,680
 I know most of you guys probably know of the Tunguska incident.

319
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,300
 It was back in the 1920s in Siberia, miles and miles of forests were just flattened by

320
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,460
 what they don't know what it was.

321
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,060
 They think it was most likely a meteorite that exploded in the air.

322
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,620
 It's an air burst and just let off this massive amount of force.

323
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,820
 And then some people say it was a nook and some people say it was aliens but that one,

324
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,460
 like a couple, a bunch of deer died, a bunch of trees got leveled and I think some Siberian

325
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,800
 farmers or whatever they do in Siberia, Siberians got killed and the Russian government went

326
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,360
 out there to look at it but you know, it's 1920s in Russia they had other stuff to worry

327
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 about.

328
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,640
 But let's look at some of the more interesting ones.

329
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,560
 Some of the ones with body counts.

330
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,720
 In 616 AD we're going to China here, right?

331
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,320
 There is this general, he has all of his troops.

332
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,440
 It's nighttime.

333
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
 I think.

334
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,380
 But we'll just say it's nighttime for the sake of the narrative of the story.

335
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,700
 It's nighttime.

336
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,100
 And they have this military camp and they're going to do military stuff.

337
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,900
 They're going to lay siege to something or beat somebody up.

338
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,440
 It's 616, I don't have a ton of details on this.

339
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,620
 So anyways, this general is there and he has this wall attacking tower sitting in his camp.

340
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,620
 And we're just sitting around doing, you know, military stuff and out of the night sky,

341
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,280
 presumably, out of the night sky.

342
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,760
 This huge fireball appears.

343
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:58,800
 And before the men can react, the wall attacking tower, the siege weapon is just annihilated.

344
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,560
 Splinters go everywhere.

345
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,560
 Fire, blah, blah, blah, blah, 10 people are killed in this attack.

346
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,520
 It was the first recorded incident of humans killed by meteorite.

347
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,140
 How would you put that in, how would you process that?

348
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,780
 The only thing I could, I think you could only think of one or two things in 616 AD.

349
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,780
 The enemy has some sort of super weapon or it was the gods.

350
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,860
 I don't think there was, I mean, to give the Chinese some more credit than that, they actually

351
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,500
 weren't pretty up on their astronomy.

352
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,900
 But I would still think that the fact that this could come out of nowhere and hit a siege

353
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,180
 weapon and kill 10 of my men, I would think the enemy had something to do with it or some

354
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,340
 sort of supernatural omen.

355
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,160
 But yeah, first recorded incident.

356
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,640
 You think about how vast the landmass of the world is.

357
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,920
 And you have this little military camp sitting out in the middle of China and this meteorite

358
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,120
 that had traveled the cosmos just blasted into one of their top weapons and killed a

359
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
 bunch of guys.

360
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,760
 Now, we're going to go to a funnier one before we get to the big one.

361
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 Here's a funnier one.

362
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,080
 So in 1633, a Franciscan friar was just not like, you know, a friar, like a monk.

363
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,500
 A Franciscan friar in Milan was like hanging out, just doing friar stuff.

364
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,980
 And a meteorite hit him in the thigh and he bled out.

365
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,820
 Now again, see, that's the thing is basically like getting a bullet.

366
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,860
 And what would you think?

367
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,020
 You're just walking along.

368
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,340
 I don't know how loud meteors are, but I would assume if it's like super small enough to

369
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,740
 just hit you in the thigh, it might sound like a bullet, maybe?

370
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
 I don't know.

371
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,360
 But anyways, how unlucky do you have to be like, at least in my daydreams, I'm either

372
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,240
 just blowing up or I have meteorite-based superpowers.

373
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
 This guy gets hit in the thigh.

374
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,080
 He's just walking on the street, all of a sudden blood's gushing out of his thigh.

375
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,440
 He's like, "Oh, oh my God, ah."

376
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
 And then he dies.

377
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,760
 And then there was a eight-pound meteorite in 1879.

378
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,700
 There were these two dudes on a boat, boat just sailing in the middle of the ocean.

379
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,760
 It hit the boat, killed the two guys.

380
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,700
 And that's why the odds are so low to actually be hit by a meteorite.

381
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,140
 Because again, that meteorite could have been a few feet to the left, a few feet to the

382
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,940
 right, and it would have never hit them.

383
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,940
 It would have landed in the water.

384
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,820
 They never would have known it was there.

385
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,900
 But to hit two people in the middle of the ocean, that's some aim or that's some chance.

386
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,300
 There's been people who have survived it.

387
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,500
 In 1954, a woman was crashing.

388
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,120
 In 1954, a woman was sleeping in her napping on her couch.

389
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,080
 And a meteorite crashed to her house and then bounced off her radio and hit her.

390
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,200
 She lived.

391
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,920
 There was another guy in 1994.

392
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,920
 A dude was walking.

393
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
 A kid was walking.

394
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,440
 A kid was walking underneath a tree.

395
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,960
 And the meteorite hit the tree, bounced off, hit him on the head.

396
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,000
 They lived because I think mostly because it hit something else and bounced off.

397
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,220
 Did you imagine taking...I mean, the kid walking under the tree, something's gonna fall on

398
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,060
 you, a cat or a coconut, something like that.

399
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,540
 But you're taking a nap.

400
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
 You're totally fine.

401
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
 It's 1954.

402
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,960
 You just got done hosting your birthday party where a demon gobble and fell out of the

403
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,180
 ceiling and you're like, "I'm throwing that picture away."

404
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,740
 You're gonna go take a nap.

405
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,540
 And you wake up with a burning rock on your stomach.

406
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,620
 Like you would have this thing weighed what, 3.9 kilograms.

407
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,660
 So what's that in pounds?

408
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,740
 That's five pounds?

409
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
 Four pounds?

410
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
 Anyways, two pounds?

411
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
 Something.

412
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's enough to wake you up.

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
 And it's hot or cold.

414
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,040
 I don't know how many you guys feel, but it's definitely a temperature different than your

415
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,120
 body.

416
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
 But you wake up, you feel sudden pressure on yourself.

417
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,600
 You're like, "Oh, this is hot and/or cold."

418
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,760
 And there's a hole in your ceiling.

419
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,920
 Your radio is destroyed.

420
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,320
 You were just napping.

421
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,600
 Now you have a 3.9 kilogram meteorite on your stomach.

422
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 Bad luck.

423
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,500
 If you would take that meteorite, I would try to crack it open and get some superpowers.

424
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,940
 So we've talked about all of these little incidences.

425
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,020
 You're like, "Jason, yeah, people die from meteorites.

426
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,540
 It's super rare."

427
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,060
 What if the Tunguska event happened over a city?

428
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,500
 That's always been a question.

429
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,540
 Because it happened over complete wilderness and a bunch of caribou died and some Siberian

430
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,940
 farmers were like, "Uh."

431
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,460
 But what would happen if that same event happened over New York City?

432
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,220
 I mean, it would have the same impact.

433
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,880
 They would just have flattened people.

434
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,040
 They would just have been liquefied.

435
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,920
 Buildings would have been completely destroyed.

436
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,800
 It would have been chaos.

437
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,360
 And it would have come out of nowhere.

438
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,320
 And that's always been the worry.

439
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:41,440
 We track those large meteorites, those LEs, those extinction level event meteorites.

440
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,280
 But the smaller ones that could do some good damage.

441
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,260
 But we do track, I think city destroyers too, but they're harder to track.

442
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
 And actually, here's a fun fact.

443
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,420
 All of our telescopes, they can't point at the sun because the sun's too bright.

444
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,020
 So a meteorite could be coming right from behind the sun.

445
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,260
 And we wouldn't see it until it was already by what, Venus?

446
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,340
 We see it coming out from Pluto.

447
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,620
 We can be like, "Oh, Armageddon, get those guys up there.

448
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,980
 You never drill.

449
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,260
 No, Spacemanist, don't worry about it."

450
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
 All that stuff.

451
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,320
 But we can't do that if it comes from the other side of the sun.

452
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,820
 But anyway, so the question has been, is it possible, and yes, it is possible, but what

453
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,740
 would happen if we had a Tunguska level event over a city?

454
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,120
 And I didn't know this, but we have.

455
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,760
 It has happened.

456
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,600
 In 1490 AD, or in China, again, there is a city.

457
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,840
 So this was in the district of Shanzai, it's now part of the Gansu province.

458
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,460
 People are out, it's daytime, supposedly.

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,880
 It's daytime, people are out shopping, buying cabbage, whatever.

460
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,620
 Kids running around, flying kites.

461
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,340
 I don't know what people did in 1490.

462
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,380
 But anyway, so they were doing these things.

463
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,300
 And out of nowhere, it happened.

464
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,380
 So here's this quote.

465
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,540
 This was an account from a survivor.

466
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,260
 "Stones felt like rain in the Qiyang district.

467
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,380
 The larger ones were about 1.5 kilograms."

468
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,760
 He didn't say kilograms, he said four to five caddies, which was a measurement back then.

469
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,880
 I'm just changing it to kilograms because it's written here.

470
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,480
 So what is that, like five pounds?

471
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 No, okay.

472
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,760
 The larger ones were about 1.5 kilograms.

473
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,760
 And the smaller ones were about 1 kilogram.

474
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,440
 "Numerous stones rained in Qiyang.

475
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,480
 Their sizes were all different.

476
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,800
 The larger ones were like goose eggs.

477
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,500
 And the smaller ones were like water chestnuts."

478
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,820
 I think this guy was hungry when he was doing this description.

479
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,300
 "More than 10,000 people were struck dead.

480
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,840
 All of the people in the city fled to other places."

481
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,340
 Right on the ground.

482
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,300
 10,000 people just killed by this.

483
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,900
 What is supposed to be another air burst?

484
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,100
 What they think is this meteorite exploded in the air?

485
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,240
 He comes down with so much force and the energy, it can't keep up with it.

486
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
 A lot of times the bigger ones don't impact the other.

487
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
 Burnup and the atmosphere just explode as they get closer to the ground.

488
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,520
 So it blew up and rained down water chestnuts and goose eggs on these people.

489
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,760
 10,000 people dead on the spot.

490
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,640
 And there are theories that that is a low estimate.

491
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,160
 Some people say it could have been tens of thousands of people were killed.

492
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,520
 Because we don't know.

493
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,900
 We have a couple of different documents referring to this event.

494
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,760
 And people like he said left.

495
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,480
 They just left the city.

496
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,520
 Because they're just out there buying cabbage, they're buying kites.

497
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
 And then imagine that.

498
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,560
 You're walking through downtown San Francisco at the pier.

499
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,960
 And you notice something's weird.

500
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,600
 You see someone buying cabbage.

501
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
 You see another guy, a little boy, flying a kite.

502
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,160
 And you're like, "Uh-oh, this is familiar."

503
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,200
 And then just you hear a BOOM.

504
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,880
 10,000 people dead all around you.

505
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,640
 You would have no idea what caused that.

506
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,880
 And again, 10,000 may be a low ball.

507
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,400
 That could happen again tomorrow.

508
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,560
 Anywhere.

509
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,520
 Is it likely that this is going to happen again?

510
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
 It's not likely, but it's definitely possible.

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,440
 It's possible that out of the blue, if we're not tracking the right object at the right

512
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:32,040
 time, without warning, tens or tens of thousands of people in a major metropolitan area could

513
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,800
 just be wiped out.

514
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,560
 If we saw one coming, do we have a plan to stop it?

515
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
 There's been theories.

516
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:43,520
 We could paint it and the light would reflect off the paint and it would slowly move it.

517
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
 But you need a lot of space to do that.

518
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,080
 Plus you need to fly a probe out there to paint it.

519
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,120
 So the light pushes it.

520
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,200
 I know it sounds ridiculous, but the light reflects on the paint and it actually moves

521
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,760
 the meteorite asteroid in space but slowly out of the way.

522
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,680
 You could fly guys up there, Armageddon-style, "Woohoo!

523
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
 Space madness!

524
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,720
 I don't want to close my eyes!"

525
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,360
 All that stuff.

526
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,660
 But again, we'd have to know that it was coming and we'd have to have time to do it.

527
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,360
 We have nothing right now to stop them right away.

528
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,120
 Use possibility you could shoot a nuke up there, but you could just as it's coming close to

529
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
 Earth.

530
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,080
 We'd probably do that if it was a planet killer.

531
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,000
 We'd probably try it if we didn't have a lot of time.

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,080
 We'd probably just try launching nukes at it.

533
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 But if it was something that was city-sized, they may go, "You know what?

534
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,920
 It's going to hit a city, but if we nuke it, it will rain down on an entire country."

535
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,200
 So suck it up, San Francisco.

536
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
 The weird thing is that we're not prepared.

537
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
 And there's been a lot.

538
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,760
 I remember when Armageddon and Deep Impact came out that there was an article I read

539
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,800
 saying that more money was spent producing those two movies than are given each year

540
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,600
 to the government to prevent asteroid impacts.

541
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,500
 It's very, very underfunded.

542
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,200
 Because it hasn't happened in our lifetime, it's really on the back burner.

543
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,840
 But the problem is, is that when it happens, it could be the end of our lifetime.

544
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,320
