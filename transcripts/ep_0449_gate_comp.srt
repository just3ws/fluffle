1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 The world ends in the coolest way possible.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
 And then we take a look at the gifted and talented education program.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
 Some people say it's a program that helps young kids

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
 who are gifted and talented achieve their dreams.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
 Others say it's a twisted mindscape used to control the future.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Today on Dead Ravver Radio.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,500
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravver Radio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,000
 It's the start of season 10.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 It's crazy when this season's done.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We'll be at episode 500.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
 Isn't that crazy?

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
 We're just gonna keep checking along like a choo-choo train.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
 The conspiracy train.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
 How come I don't have a train?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 If I ever come up with a train, the Carpenter Caboose?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 We'll think about that.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 But while we're thinking about that, we gotta say thank you to one of our newest patreons.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,000
 We got Caleb.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
 Caleb in the house.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 Really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
 Let's get him on board that Carpenter Caboose.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,500
 That just sounds wrong.

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 Because the Caboose is the end, right?

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 Um, whatever.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 We're a backwards train.

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
 Let's hop on board the Carpenter Caboose, Caleb.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You are going to be piling it.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You're like, "Dude, I can't see from back here."

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
 Yeah, yeah, you'll figure it out.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 So anyways, as he, as Caleb is shoveling coal into our brand new vehicle, the Carpenter Caboose,

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 we are headed out to Rostov-on-Don.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 That's in Russia.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 It's October 7th, 1989.

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 It's midnight.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 There's like a full moon in the sky.

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 Don't look that up.

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 If you find out there's not a full moon on October 7th, 1989, like in some sort of like National Geographic Farm Resolomon Act nonsense,

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 don't even help me.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 Just for visual, right?

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
 Just for, you're like, "Jason, that's factually incorrect."

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 Yeah, but it's a beautiful factually incorrect image.

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Full moon.

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 I don't know why it's making wind noises, but it's, it's doing it.

48
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 That was in the Farm Resolomon Act.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 Look that up.

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 Moon.

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 And there's a young woman named Valentina Valdina walking on the street.

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 She's walking on the street and she sees two glowing orbs.

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 Right now, that's weird, right?

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 You don't expect to see orbs when you're leaving your place of work, unless you work at Orbs Arrest and you're like,

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 "Buy Orbs, seize these Orbs.

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 I don't know why you would be saying goodbye to the merchandise you sell.

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 No one's walking out of toys arrest me."

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 And you're like, "See you later, toys.

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 See you tomorrow.

60
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 I can't wait to sell more of you."

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 And apparently you're Mickey Mouse as well in that scenario.

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 The little orbs are flying out.

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 Now one of the orbs turns into the shape of a human.

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 She's just like, "What in the world is going on?

65
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 I should not be walking around at night.

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 It's midnight.

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 She's walking around the outskirts of the city.

68
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 She sees these two orbs.

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 One of them shapeshifts into a human and then the other orb just goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 And starts like shining lights on the human.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 Weird.

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 You just bring your own disco ball with you, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

73
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 She's like, "She's got a lot of lights on her.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

76
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

78
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

79
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

81
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

83
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

85
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

88
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 She's got a lot of lights on her.

90
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 I can't stay awake.

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:45,500

 I can't stay awake.

176
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 I can't stay awake.

177
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 I can't stay awake.

178
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 I can't stay awake.

179
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 I can't stay awake.

180
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 I can't stay awake.

181
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 I can't stay awake.

182
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 I can't stay awake.

183
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 I can't stay awake.

184
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 I can't stay awake.

185
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
 I can't stay awake.

186
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 I can't stay awake.

187
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 I can't stay awake.

188
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 I can't stay awake.

189
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 I can't stay awake.

190
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 I can't stay awake.

191
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 I can't stay awake.

192
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 I can't stay awake.

193
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 I can't stay awake.

194
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 I can't stay awake.

195
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
 I can't stay awake.

196
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 I can't stay awake.

197
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 I can't stay awake.

198
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 I can't stay awake.

199
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 I can't stay awake.

200
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 I can't stay awake.

201
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 I can't stay awake.

202
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 I can't stay awake.

203
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 I can't stay awake.

204
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
 I can't stay awake.

205
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 I can't stay awake.

206
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 I can't stay awake.

207
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 I can't stay awake.

208
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 I can't stay awake.

209
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 I can't stay awake.

210
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
 I can't stay awake.

211
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 I can't stay awake.

212
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 I can't stay awake.

213
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 I can't stay awake.

214
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 I can't stay awake.

215
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 I can't stay awake.

216
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 I can't stay awake.

217
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 I can't stay awake.

218
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 I can't stay awake.

219
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 I can't stay awake.

220
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 I can't stay awake.

221
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 So the woman's like, "No, I don't want to go."

222
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,000
 And she's totally petrified, despite the fact that she's super, super sick.

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
 She feels the aliens are giving this to her.

224
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,740
 So she's like, "No, I don't want to go with you.

225
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,340
 So you can give me worse migraines on our planet.

226
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,000
 Migraines are considered orgasms."

227
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
 No, this is awful.

228
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,180
 I just want to stay here.

229
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,980
 And the alien goes, "Watch this."

230
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,540
 And then a giant view screen appears in Valentina's bedroom.

231
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,780
 That's kind of cool, right?

232
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,820
 She refused to go on the ship, but they brought the ship technology to her.

233
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
 That's pretty polite.

234
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,420
 A view screen appears in--and I know you're going chasing this woman, obviously.

235
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,620
 She's having some sort of fever dream.

236
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
 She's in bed.

237
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,260
 She's been sick for three days.

238
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,740
 An alien shows up and now the alien's magical.

239
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,740
 She's obviously having some sort of delirium.

240
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,780
 Let me just finish this story, skeptic Joe.

241
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:08,540
 The giant magical screen appears in the Valentina's bedroom and it shows images of an alien planet.

242
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,620
 Supposedly the alien planet the alien's from, right?

243
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,980
 That wouldn't make sense.

244
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,540
 The alien could be tricking her and showing her like a really cool planet that's near

245
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,940
 their planet, near the blue star, but not the one they're taking to her, not migraineopolis.

246
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,140
 But she starts--we'll assume it's the alien's homeworld that the alien's not some con man.

247
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:34,620
 You see this--on this view screen Valentina sees this beautiful alien landscape with just

248
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,660
 beautiful lakes.

249
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:41,860
 She said that the lakes looked like the color was mother of pearl.

250
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,260
 She actually doesn't look that appetizing.

251
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,580
 That looks kind of--they would look unclean to a human if you saw like a cloudy white

252
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
 lake.

253
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,580
 I'm like, "Ugh, no thanks.

254
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,580
 Ugh."

255
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
 That's gross.

256
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
 I'm not swimming in that.

257
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,220
 You get out, you're all covered in white goo.

258
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
 Uh-uh.

259
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,580
 And then she sees these large, like, virgin fields of grass.

260
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,980
 There's no buildings is what that means.

261
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,220
 It doesn't mean that the grass doesn't procreate.

262
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,820
 It means that just like--there's grass, grass as far as the eye can see.

263
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,100
 Which to you and me would be super boring, right?

264
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,780
 Eventually you'd want to run into something, like at least some patch of dirt.

265
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,860
 You'd be like, "Oh, that's exciting.

266
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,580
 There's a pitcher's mound out here."

267
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,780
 But anyways, grass as the eye can see, virgin grass as far as the eye can see, creamy white

268
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,180
 lakes, soup, lakes.

269
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,660
 That's gross.

270
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,940
 And then that doesn't sell Valentina.

271
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,980
 She--Valentina does say it's one of the most beautiful images she's ever seen in her life.

272
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,260
 Like, she's absolutely mind-boggling.

273
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,060
 She sees these sea--this sea of the white film, ugh, and all this virgin grass and stuff

274
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
 like that.

275
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,580
 And then--but that doesn't make the sale.

276
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,980
 That doesn't make the sale, right?

277
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,820
 This is the alien's ace in the hole.

278
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,740
 This is alien--so basically the alien one.

279
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,420
 The woman showed up, gave her crippling migraines.

280
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,980
 That might have been accidental.

281
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
 Then breaks into her house.

282
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,700
 She says, "Come home with me.

283
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,860
 You won't regret it."

284
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,580
 And then the Valentina's like, "No."

285
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,180
 And then the alien goes, "Well, look how beautiful my planet is."

286
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,820
 I shift from side to side when she says, "My planet?

287
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,140
 It's the planet next door."

288
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,620
 And still doesn't sell Valentina.

289
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,500
 And then this is where we get to what's important to us as humans, as homo sapiens.

290
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,660
 This is the most important part of this story.

291
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,380
 So then the alien goes, "Okay."

292
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:33,060
 And then the view screen dims and it comes back to a human city.

293
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,100
 So now she's seeing a vision of Earth.

294
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,220
 So it's like this human city.

295
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,660
 And Valentina wasn't able to identify if it was Seattle or San Francisco or Kiev or anything

296
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
 like that.

297
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
 What is Ares?

298
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,900
 But what she sees is this human city and a giant monster.

299
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,140
 Looking over buildings, stepping on stuff.

300
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,180
 And then another giant monster sweeps down into the city, grabs a skyscraper, rips it

301
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,580
 in tube.

302
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,100
 People are running down the street, creatures of immense magnitude, chasing them down, grabbing

303
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,820
 humans underneath their claws, ripping them.

304
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,460
 One looks right at the camera, charges the camera.

305
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,220
 She sees the ends of the world will not be through fire or storm.

306
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,180
 It will be through massive monsters that are going to destroy our man-made cities with

307
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,340
 their bare hands.

308
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,620
 And the alien goes, "This is the future of Earth."

309
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,220
 This is the future of Earth.

310
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
 This is her...

311
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,780
 Should we have a quote from these horrible images and admittedly pretty badass images,

312
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
 right?

313
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
 Here's these quotes.

314
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,740
 "The future is what awaits the Earth."

315
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,340
 We are shielding you from this, but we are not omnipotent.

316
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
 Remember that.

317
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,140
 I give you three days, and then I will come for you.

318
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,620
 So now, Valentina, it's not just, "Hey, you got a horrible migraine.

319
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,140
 Why don't you come visit my place for a while?"

320
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,900
 Now it's, listen, monsters are going to destroy your cities.

321
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,020
 Giant... all those monster movies you ever saw.

322
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,060
 Talk about predictive programming.

323
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,100
 Mothra is real.

324
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,820
 All of these creatures are actually going to destroy human civilization.

325
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,780
 And we can hold them off, but we can't stop them forever.

326
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,580
 I'm going to give you three days to think about it.

327
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
 Alien fades from view.

328
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,260
 I'm assuming the view screen faded from view as well, because I don't think she spent

329
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,820
 the next three days not going into her bedroom, because it's just snuff films of monsters

330
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
 eating people.

331
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
 She's like, "Where's the remote?

332
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,820
 Where's the remote?"

333
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,460
 She's sleeping in the living room.

334
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
 She can hear the...

335
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,460
 "Ah!

336
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,860
 It's the 18th day of the monsters attacking all of civilization."

337
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,860
 And we're still, "No!

338
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
 Ah!"

339
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
 She hears all of the...

340
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,020
 She would not have a hard time staying awake at that point, knowing that in the other room

341
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,300
 people are being murdered in the future.

342
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,700
 Three days pass, Valentina.

343
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,140
 I'm assuming her migraines have gone away at this point too.

344
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,020
 Now she's probably just puking up blood from anxiety, but we don't have any more notice

345
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,140
 of her having the migraines.

346
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,440
 But three days pass, and all of a sudden she feels a tingling, or what she calls, "Six

347
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,540
 Signals" in her brain.

348
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
 "Uhhh...

349
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
 Uhhh..."

350
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,260
 And you're like, "Jason, that is the biggest piece of evidence that this woman is having

351
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,500
 some sort of neurologic...

352
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,580
 Neurological Disorder, okay?

353
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,980
 You're saying this woman...

354
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,740
 The story is probably true in the sense that this woman had some sort of neurological problem,

355
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,380
 because she was exposed to some Russian technology that was bright lighting it causing an instant

356
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,820
 tumor in her brain.

357
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,560
 She's hallucinating, obviously, Jason, and now she's having signals in her brain.

358
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,080
 That's a reasonable answer, right?

359
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,640
 There's something physically wrong with her brain, but we're not looking at the reasonable

360
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 answer.

361
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,400
 We're gonna do the cool one, the sci-fi one.

362
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,760
 So she has these signals in her, she feels these signals in her brain, and Valentina,

363
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,680
 all of a sudden, feels her body almost force herself to lay down.

364
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,760
 And then she...

365
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,000
 "Woooooo..."

366
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,840
 Now she starts floating around her house.

367
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 She's like knocking over vases and stuff like that.

368
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,460
 She's floating around her house.

369
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,940
 She's not doing it on purpose.

370
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,580
 She's not like, "Oh, it's my one o'clock float time."

371
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,100
 She's floating around the house, and then all of a sudden her house morphs into this

372
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,900
 long, dark corridor.

373
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,500
 So she's floating down this hallway, and she hears the voice of the alien woman in her

374
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 head.

375
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 And we have another quote.

376
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,620
 These are always interesting when we have these exact quotes from these things.

377
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
 We have this quote here.

378
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,660
 "We want to help you.

379
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,700
 Here we already have many people like you.

380
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,480
 When no one remains on Earth, everything will start from the beginning, here in this place.

381
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,000
 We will do that, and for that purpose, we need you."

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Then BAM!

383
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,160
 Valentina is sitting on her couch, in her house, totally alone.

384
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
 It's an interesting story.

385
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,680
 I mean, obviously the first thing is it could be completely made up.

386
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
 It was...

387
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
 I got it from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

388
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,400
 They got it from a place called Cosmo Letts.

389
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,140
 It's a newspaper in Russia at the time that dealt with UFO stuff.

390
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,980
 It was also documented in a 20th century Chronicle of Unexplained Phenomenon, a book published

391
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,380
 in Moscow in 1998.

392
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,860
 So she could be totally making it up.

393
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
 Someone else could have made it up.

394
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,820
 Those are all obvious things that can happen.

395
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,340
 Could be some sort of biological, like I said, some sort of tumor, some sort of mental breakdown,

396
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
 things like that.

397
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,860
 But that's all fair to discuss, but this story's gone on a long time, so we're actually going

398
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,440
 to wrap it up with this ending that we like, which is the science fiction ending.

399
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
 You go...

400
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,040
 It's weird that the alien's trying to get her to come, come, and then when they finally

401
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
 do get her, she basically doesn't have a choice.

402
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
 She starts floating down the hallway, and then they give that little speech to her, that

403
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,040
 they need her, that the world is going to be emptied of humans.

404
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,720
 And this place she's in will be the birth of a new cycle, a new race, the new set of

405
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 human.

406
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
 Then she appears back on her couch.

407
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,860
 I think there's two ways to look at that.

408
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,780
 One is that they decided they didn't need her.

409
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,220
 Like she went on that journey, she was floating down that thing.

410
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
 She went...

411
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
 Either they said, "You know what?

412
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,120
 We don't need her to deposit her back on Earth."

413
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,620
 She refused again to go.

414
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,440
 She was so afraid of the unknown.

415
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,660
 She refused again to go, and she doesn't remember that part, and the aliens are like, "Just cut

416
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
 her loose.

417
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
 We'll find someone else."

418
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
 She ends up back on the couch.

419
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,340
 It's possible the whole thing may be a near-death experience.

420
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,740
 I think the scary...

421
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,760
 Other than the fact that monsters are eventually going to destroy the world, which is really

422
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 cool.

423
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,480
 Like if the world is going to end, I want it to end with monsters crushing cities, because

424
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
 that would be a sight to behold.

425
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,800
 I want a meteorite attack.

426
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,880
 That'd be okay, because it'd be kind of cool, I guess, to watch.

427
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,920
 But monsters attacking the planet, you'd be able to stretch it out as long as possible.

428
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,360
 You'd be fighting them in the streets, and you'd have military and eventually giant robots

429
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
 and stuff.

430
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
 Power Rangers and all that.

431
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,520
 That's cool.

432
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,420
 It would suck, though, to be showing a vision of how the world was going to be destroyed,

433
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,820
 and then taking aboard an alien ship, and the next thing you know, you're back on your

434
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
 couch.

435
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,420
 So you would think, "Wait a second.

436
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,100
 You just showed me that the world's going to be destroyed, and I was special, but now

437
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,380
 I'm back on this couch.

438
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,380
 What gives?"

439
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,220
 Now here's my theory.

440
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,340
 This is creepy.

441
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,500
 Valentina Valdina is an alien clone.

442
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,740
 The real her is in this realm, swimming in these mother of pearl lakes.

443
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,160
 The clone left behind in her place is such a perfect clone.

444
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,640
 She doesn't know she's a clone.

445
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,840
 She believes that all of the life leading up to being placed back on that couch was her

446
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,940
 life.

447
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,680
 This woman who was built on an alien spacecraft, so no one would notice that Valentina was

448
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 missing.

449
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,160
 All of a sudden, sitting on a couch, back filled with all these memories leading up to this

450
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
 event.

451
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,800
 True memories!

452
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,780
 She's not a real person, and that clone doesn't know that it's not human.

453
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,100
 And is so distraught with these experiences that have been programmed into its alien brain,

454
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,220
 it calls up a UFO researcher.

455
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,100
 So something's happened to me.

456
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,660
 Never suspecting for a minute that the real Valentina is safe and sound near the blue

457
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:15,260
 star preparing for the destruction of Earth while her clone was sent here to be sacrificed

458
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,880
 with the other 7 billion humans.

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
 But again, if you're going to get killed by anything, you might as well be giant monsters.

460
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,680
 Caleb, let's get out of the Carpenter Caboose, I'm Natasha the Keys of the Carpenter Copter.

461
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,600
 We are flying out to middle of USA, Kansas.

462
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 We're flying over a bunch of farmland, bunch of like wheat and stuff like that, corns everywhere.

463
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:49,020
 And we're just landing in an ordinary school landing right in their playground.

464
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,900
 Tetherballs are getting cut by the rotor blades, we're purposely landing on the 4 square

465
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
 courts.

466
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,220
 Just mess it up, let's hop out of this Carpenter Copter.

467
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,260
 Now, this is a conspiracy theory that's been going on for a long time, and it's actually

468
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,700
 a request from a listener named George.

469
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,380
 So thank you so much George for recommending this.

470
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,180
 This is a story that's been around a long time.

471
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,560
 Now let's go ahead and hook up one of those Tetherballs, I feel bad that I wrecked them

472
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
 all because I really like Tetherball.

473
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,840
 We're going to play Tetherball a bit while I'm giving you the introduction for this story.

474
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,120
 So let's see how good your skills are.

475
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 So and before we get started, let me give you some quick background here.

476
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,520
 Some quick background.

477
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,400
 The GATE program is called Gifted and Talented Education.

478
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,920
 It is a program to take kids that have higher IQ or are more skilled in certain areas.

479
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,600
 They are then put into a, for one hour a week, they're put in their own classroom to work

480
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,500
 with other gifted kids.

481
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,980
 It's also called Tag, Talented and Gifted.

482
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,100
 It's called different things in different states and there's programs like this all

483
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,540
 over the world.

484
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,420
 So that is what the GATE program is.

485
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,660
 That's a quick overview of it.

486
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,580
 Let's talk about what the actual conspiracy theory is as well.

487
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,420
 And I am not adding this in after I've already added the episode and realized that I left

488
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,780
 out some key details.

489
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,160
 So the fact that this sounds different, it's just magic.

490
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
 It's just magic, okay?

491
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,120
 This is not an edit fix.

492
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,320
 The conspiracy theory that we're going to be talking about is this.

493
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,760
 There are a series of traits that people who are in these programs seem to share.

494
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,240
 And the conspiracy theory started off with the idea that people who were chosen to be

495
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:31,800
 in these gifted and talented programs had some sort of other odd biological or social

496
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,780
 markers that also identified them to be in these programs.

497
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,780
 The conspiracy theory quickly shifted from that to the fact that the people who were

498
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:48,060
 in these GATE programs were being identified to be gifted and talented young kids, but

499
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,180
 they were too talented.

500
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,700
 They were too gifted.

501
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,540
 And the group, the shadowy group that actually ran the GATE program wiped their memories

502
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
 clean.

503
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,880
 A lot of things, a lot of the kids who went to these GATE programs don't remember being

504
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 in GATE.

505
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,620
 They remember being in GATE, but they don't remember what was actually in the classroom.

506
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,020
 So the conspiracy theory starts off with, isn't it weird?

507
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,000
 I did a survey online of all these traits of people who had been in the GATE program,

508
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,600
 and it quickly morphed into a Illuminati Control narrative, where the reason why we were chosen

509
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 to be in GATE programs in the first place was because we posed a threat to the New World

510
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,520
 Order, and so they took us and they wiped our brains.

511
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,180
 That is the conspiracy theory in a nutshell.

512
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,700
 And then you're going to hear me, I go into more detail as far as that goes, but I realize

513
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,740
 I neglected to actually tell you what I was building up to.

514
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,820
 So the conspiracy theory we're going to talk about involves gifted and talented education

515
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,700
 programs and the fact that people are being pulled out of their classes, being mind wiped

516
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,260
 so they don't pose a threat to the coming New World Order.

517
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,180
 That is the conspiracy theory, which I managed to talk about for 20 minutes.

518
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,040
 I've never actually explained it, so there you go.

519
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,800
 Let's go ahead, we're traveling back in time to when I recorded this episode.

520
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,960
 Here we go.

521
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,560
 So this is a conspiracy theory that's fairly new.

522
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,160
 It really goes back to about 2009, 2010.

523
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,760
 It really started to gain traction on a forum called Godlike Productions.

524
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,320
 It's also where the nobody came from.

525
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,680
 We discussed the nobody last week, I believe it was, the last week of season nine.

526
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,100
 From Godlike Productions, there was a user back in 2010 who went by the name Jane Gray,

527
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,180
 who originally started this thing saying, "Here's a list of all of these traits that

528
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,540
 seem to be universal among people who go to the gate program."

529
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,860
 So get out your pencils or pins or tablets for you young whippersnappers, however you

530
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,460
 want to keep tally of the stuff.

531
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,980
 You go, "Well, Jason, I didn't go to gate.

532
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
 Why should I?"

533
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,420
 It's actually probably more interesting if you didn't go to the gate program, if you

534
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,620
 met, meet these things, right?

535
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,940
 So you'll be our control group.

536
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,080
 Now I changed schools every two years.

537
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,480
 Let me say this up front too.

538
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
 I know I've kind of been winding.

539
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
 I changed schools every two years.

540
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,640
 I never joined a gate program.

541
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,200
 I was never in gate.

542
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
 However, I did do an episode way back in the day.

543
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,160
 It was episode 201 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

544
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
 It's called The Dragon.

545
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,120
 Although I was never actually in the gate, and I recommend listening to that episode

546
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
 after listening to this one.

547
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,200
 I think you might appreciate it more after this one.

548
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:30,620
 But even though I was never in a gate program, I was in a similar type program.

549
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,260
 That's really the only way I can identify it.

550
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,260
 I remember when I was a kid, they talked about gate, but we moved every two or three years.

551
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,580
 So I was getting identified to be in gate programs, but I never was because I was moving around

552
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
 too much.

553
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,620
 It's the parent's choice of whether or not to put the kids in the gate program.

554
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,840
 Remember when I was at a elementary school, Strawberry Point Elementary School in Mill

555
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,380
 Valley, an interesting thing happened, a gate-esque thing happened, where I was taken out of my

556
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,440
 class once a week to go to this cubicle, and that's all I remember.

557
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,040
 So I recommend listening to episode 201.

558
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,740
 You don't have to, but I think it's an interesting companion piece to this story.

559
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,560
 So I was not in the gate program.

560
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,180
 I was identified to go into the gate program, but I never went.

561
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,640
 But anyways, here's the thing.

562
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,740
 Get ready, guys.

563
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,100
 Gate program or not, let's take a look at some of these things.

564
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,780
 Do you have blue eyes or hazel eyes?

565
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,060
 That's a pretty huge swath of the human population, right?

566
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,460
 But that seems to be a sign most people in the gate program have blue or hazel eyes.

567
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
 Oxypital buns.

568
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,940
 That's where you got a little bump on the back of your skull.

569
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
 You got that?

570
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
 I mean, I have a skull.

571
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,020
 I don't think I have that bun.

572
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,200
 The Oxypital bun is apparently the math bump, which I obviously don't have because I despise

573
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,340
 math.

574
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,440
 Birth complications.

575
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
 Birth complications.

576
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,480
 Either born premature, born extremely late, or born not breathing.

577
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,040
 So I guess I should say this.

578
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 I have hazel eyes.

579
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,200
 I don't have an Oxypital bun.

580
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,640
 I was born and had a heart attack as a baby.

581
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
 My mom says that's not true, but my doctor was like, "No, no, no.

582
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
 When you were born, you flatlined.

583
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,440
 We had to bring you back to life."

584
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,480
 So you're listening to a podcast from a zombie, bro.

585
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,240
 Near-death experiences, particularly drowning, I had that.

586
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,300
 Lack of memory of the GATE program.

587
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
 Definitely had that.

588
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
 Again, what I was in was not GATE, but it was something.

589
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,740
 Technically, it was speech therapy.

590
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,300
 It was what actually it was billed as.

591
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,340
 It was me and this girl, and we were taken into a cubicle, and then I don't remember

592
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
 anything.

593
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,780
 I have no memory of it.

594
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,260
 Listen to episode 201, because the story is just not me going, "I don't remember."

595
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,540
 There's an interesting conclusion to it, but I don't want to give it away.

596
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,420
 It's not important in this episode anyways.

597
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
 Lack of memory of GATE.

598
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,880
 It's something that always stood out to me whenever I went to speech therapy.

599
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,200
 I don't remember anything.

600
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,760
 I can obviously talk much better now.

601
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,160
 Windows were covered in the GATE classroom.

602
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,320
 That was the same for me.

603
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,760
 Now we get to tendency to being followed, tracked, abducted by aliens or other humans.

604
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
 What?

605
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
 Where do these people live?

606
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,200
 No, I haven't had that.

607
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,760
 A law enforcement being extremely lenient and easy during chance encounters.

608
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
 Absolutely.

609
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,700
 I mean, I've had my tangles with law enforcement, but for the most part it's been, "Have a

610
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 good day, officer.

611
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,700
 You too, sir."

612
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,180
 So that one is true.

613
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,900
 But see, this is where we start to get to stuff that's kind of biased, right?

614
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,820
 Because then you get to stuff like early, lots of drug use in teenage years.

615
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
 Drug experimentation.

616
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,220
 So not just drug use, but you're like, "I want to test the limits of my psychedelic mind."

617
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
 Stuff like that.

618
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,400
 Interest in paranormal phenomenon is one of them.

619
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,480
 Forehead scars.

620
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,860
 Early speech therapy is actually one of them listed, like I was born into.

621
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
 Migraines.

622
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,120
 Maybe Valentina was one of these things.

623
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,240
 The thing with the lenient law enforcement, early psychedelic use or drug experimentation,

624
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,440
 that if you weren't, if it wasn't lenient police, you weren't on godlike productions,

625
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
 right?

626
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,480
 You're into drugs and the police nabbed you and they threw the book at you and then you

627
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,720
 do five years for trafficking marijuana in federal prison and then you come out.

628
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,560
 You're not on godlike productions.

629
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,000
 That's important to look at because you're listing things that if they're wrong, guesses,

630
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,280
 they're not going to pop up in the stats.

631
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,600
 It's one of those things of saying 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

632
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,680
 That's true, right?

633
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,280
 But then there could be a guy who jumps off the Grand Canyon flies away.

634
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,400
 That's a bad analogy, but you know what I mean?

635
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,880
 The guy who flies away, let's say the 100th person, 99 people jump off the Grand Canyon

636
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 and die.

637
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
 Don't do this, don't do this.

638
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,040
 But then the 100th person jumps off the Grand Canyon and flies away and goes to the blue

639
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
 star.

640
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,000
 The stats would still always show that 100% of the people who jumped off the, jumped off

641
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
 the Death Canyon, what is it?

642
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,720
 Not the Death Canyon, 100 people dropped the new name of it.

643
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,120
 We said petition change.org.

644
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,240
 100 people who jump off the Grand Canyon die.

645
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,800
 It never accounts for the fact that the person who flies away and goes to the blue star.

646
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,520
 There's a stupid analogy, but my point is, is that, yes, police have been lenient on

647
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,320
 me because if they weren't lenient on me and they caught me with weapons in my car, or

648
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:20,240
 caught me for going so far over the speed limit, or caught me for driving uninsured with

649
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,080
 no registration and causing a car accident, and all of those things happened, and they

650
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,520
 were just like, yeah, whatever.

651
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,360
 If they didn't happen, I wouldn't be on Gullike Productions.

652
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,400
 I would be in jail or prison.

653
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,040
 You see how that works.

654
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,000
 And the other thing is, interested in paranormal phenomenon.

655
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,020
 It's on a paranormal board.

656
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,880
 So everyone who is, was in the gate program and is on the paranormal board are like, oh,

657
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,080
 that's me, that's right, it's a bias thing.

658
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,360
 If this was on Barstool Sports website, then you get a bigger cross-section of people.

659
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,120
 That was another thing, they said none of these gate people ever reported being involved

660
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
 in sports at all.

661
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,640
 We're playing tetherball, so we're athletes.

662
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,160
 So we're not part of that either, but no sports at all.

663
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,720
 Then we get into probably the weirdest thing, Israeli art student girlfriends.

664
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
 Apparently that's super common among people who went to the gate program, that they all

665
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,840
 somehow met a girl who was an Israeli art student.

666
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,000
 Now millions of people have been through the gate program over the years.

667
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,880
 So technically, if this part of it was true, you'd have more people who have an Israeli

668
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
 art girlfriend than there are citizens of Israel.

669
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,080
 So again, I mean, maybe, maybe that seems to be like an outlier thing.

670
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,600
 Like 10% of the people have Israeli art student girlfriends, and that's weirder than the average.

671
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,520
 I don't, so that's, this is where I'm starting to think this was a joke, right?

672
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,280
 But this, I remember reading this, this took off really, really quickly.

673
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,000
 And a lot of people were running with this and going, "Oh, I also have migraines."

674
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,080
 And I used to have a crush on an Israeli art student girl.

675
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
 So maybe that's the same thing.

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,960
 And the cops had been really lenient on me when I was stalking that girl.

677
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
 This one really took off.

678
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,600
 So people started looking into this.

679
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,080
 And really what it is, it's a list of traits that if you meet half of them, you qualify

680
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,840
 to be an interesting and unique person.

681
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,400
 This is one of those conspiracy theories that is based on ego, which are the most cunning

682
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,080
 of all conspiracy theories, right?

683
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,880
 This conspiracy theory is telling you, you gifted it and talented education student,

684
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,800
 that there's something different about you, even as an adult.

685
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,560
 So people started looking into what this could be.

686
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,520
 So people say that it's the government looking for the next wave of leaders.

687
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
 That's probably the most realistic one.

688
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,720
 And I talked about this a couple times on the show before.

689
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,080
 If a government, a government's goal is to do two things, to maintain the future of said

690
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,040
 government and to create the next generation of taxpayers.

691
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 That's it.

692
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,760
 That's 100% it.

693
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,120
 That's all any world government wants to do.

694
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,000
 They want to keep being around and they want to have a next generation of taxpayers.

695
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,400
 And when you look at world politics through that lens, you'll see so many things make

696
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
 sense.

697
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,960
 So many things make sense that we attribute hostile or bad action to.

698
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,360
 They want to be around in 100 years and they want to have taxpayers next year.

699
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,760
 That's 100% how governments operate.

700
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,360
 So you would want to identify gifted children in your population so you can have the next

701
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,800
 generation of scientists, of chemists, of architects, of engineers, stuff like that.

702
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,480
 You want to go because it wasn't they were put in their own schools.

703
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,680
 It wasn't Professor Xavier showing up pulling them out of schools.

704
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,680
 They were just giving a little bit extra high level training.

705
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,720
 They were just, and let's go back to the thing too about people not remembering things.

706
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
 It's funny because there's two different sides of this.

707
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,640
 Some people go, "I don't remember anything."

708
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,040
 And then other people go, "Oh, I remember all of these programs we did."

709
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,360
 And it was like these weird social experiments.

710
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
 So what is it?

711
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,640
 Do people don't remember it or do people remember weird experiments going on?

712
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,000
 Again, it kind of breaks down there.

713
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,600
 But a government does want to identify gifted people in their population.

714
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 No doubt.

715
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
 No doubt.

716
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,280
 Now, generally it's a federal program and the states are in charge of it and the states

717
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
 go to the school districts.

718
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,560
 And some school districts don't have money to have these programs.

719
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,720
 They still have to identify them for the state to go, "Yeah, we have this amount of gifted

720
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,440
 kids in our program, but this one kid is really gifted at tetherball.

721
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,040
 I'm looking out the window right now, dude.

722
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,160
 This dude's super buff and he's just hitting that ball."

723
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 You have that.

724
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,400
 Then you have a group of people who believe that it's private nonprofit organizations that

725
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,480
 are trying to control the world.

726
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,840
 Here's where we get to the whole Illuminati thing.

727
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,840
 They want to control the world.

728
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,960
 So what they're doing is they're identifying these gifted kids and they're doing MK Ultra

729
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,080
 type experiments to them in these classrooms.

730
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,640
 So the brains don't work.

731
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,400
 These kids are going to be the future leaders of the world.

732
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,800
 They're going to be the John Connors.

733
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,720
 You have these evil organizations in the shadows being like, "Oh, no.

734
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,760
 We know that someday this new generation will rise up and they'll destroy us.

735
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 What can we do?

736
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
 Well, we could kill them.

737
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,840
 That would be the best option, but no, no, no, no.

738
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,560
 We're going to engage in a decade-long program, decades-long.

739
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,040
 This started back in the 1950s, gate program.

740
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,720
 We're going to do this and what we're going to do is we're going to identify these kids

741
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,000
 and then we're going to wipe their brains and turn them into total losers as adults.

742
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,920
 That's our plan, us Illuminati dudes.

743
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,680
 That's actually conspiracy theory that's going around that.

744
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,640
 The program is set up to dumb down the future generations.

745
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,800
 Here's the problem with that.

746
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,960
 One, it's completely illogical, but here's the problem with that.

747
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,120
 If we follow that core, fluoride's already supposed to be dumb on us down.

748
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,280
 Chemtrails are already supposed to be dumb on us down.

749
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,040
 There's already all these conspiracy vaccines supposed to give us autism.

750
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,080
 There's already all of these other conspiracy theories that are supposed to accomplish the

751
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,560
 same thing.

752
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,280
 Why would a private organization go, "No, no, no, we want some of that.

753
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,880
 We saved some of that brainwashing for me?"

754
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,160
 And set up this program that started back in 1954 to do the same thing that's already

755
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,000
 happening to the gen- I don't believe it's happening.

756
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,560
 I don't believe that the chemtrails and the fluoride and the vaccines are doing this stuff,

757
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,800
 but if you believe in the conspiracy theories, which most people don't believe in just one,

758
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,800
 most people believe in multiple ones, there's like a shared universe, why would a private

759
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,880
 group try doing this on their own?

760
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,120
 Two, there's way easier ways to eliminate the leaders of the world.

761
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,440
 It's the way they eliminate the current leaders of the world, which is through assassination,

762
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,640
 or just buying them out.

763
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,880
 That'd be way easier, right?

764
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,760
 Than trying to start this huge program where people are going to fall through the cracks

765
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,880
 and stuff like that.

766
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,840
 And there are people who go out of gate programs and go on to be successful.

767
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,080
 This conspiracy theory points towards the people who went to gate programs and aren't

768
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
 successful.

769
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,680
 See, the reason why they're not successful, because the Illuminati got to them.

770
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,880
 So we'll go back to that one, because that's a very interesting conspiracy theory.

771
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,080
 But there's another conspiracy theory, and this was so interesting, because I was researching

772
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,120
 this back in March before coronavirus shut everything down.

773
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,760
 Back when I was able to do Jiu Jitsu, I would pack up my computer, go do Jiu Jitsu, go to

774
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,000
 a coffee shop, and just read nonsense for three or four hours.

775
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,440
 I read this website called Barbarism.net.

776
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,580
 And this guy wrote this article called "Conspiracy Theory, Gifted and Talented Equals Product

777
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,880
 to Research and Development."

778
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,720
 This is written by an author, he writes this article, and he says, "I remember going to..."

779
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,840
 This article was back in 2009, so it actually predates the Godlike production thing.

780
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:40,400
 He writes this article, and he says that his theory was that gate was run by private corporations.

781
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
 So not like private non-profits, but for-profit companies.

782
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,720
 And he tells a story about this kid.

783
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
 It might have been him.

784
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,520
 I'm having a hard time remembering, and we'll get to why I'm having a hard time remembering

785
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,180
 this second, but we'll say it's him for the sake of argument.

786
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,580
 He is in a gate program when he's a kid.

787
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,220
 These people come in, and there's like his normal gate teacher there, but then someone

788
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,700
 else comes in, starts talking about the hula hoop.

789
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,140
 It says, "Do you guys like hula hoops?"

790
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
 And the kids are like, "No, boo, hula hoops, relay."

791
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,540
 And this is like back in the 80s.

792
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
 Hula hoops suck.

793
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,940
 And the guys like starts crying.

794
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,940
 It's like, "Okay, well, maybe don't be so mean next time, but how could we make the

795
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,740
 hula hoop better?

796
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,820
 Let's all come up with an idea to make a hula hoop better."

797
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,680
 So the kids get around, and they start thinking about it, doing like these gifted kids, putting

798
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,480
 their brains together, and they go, "What about a hula hoop that counted how many times it

799
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
 went around you?

800
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
 Put a little counter on it?"

801
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,160
 And the man's like, "That's stupid."

802
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,400
 And he leaves.

803
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,120
 And then a couple years later, this guy said he saw on television advertising a whammo

804
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,200
 hula hoop that had a counter on it.

805
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,920
 So his conspiracy theory was that these, because some schools don't have gate programs, because

806
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,340
 you do have to have an extra teacher, an extra facility, all this stuff, his theory was that

807
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,140
 the gate programs exist, and they're funded by private companies, and they do product

808
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,500
 testing.

809
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,220
 So all of these mental games and stuff like that, it's a way to refine toys or products

810
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
 for kids.

811
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,220
 That makes far more sense than the Illuminati.

812
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,180
 It makes less sense than the government wanting to identify and nurture the smartest of their

813
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,900
 population, but it kind of falls right.

814
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,480
 It's definitely more believable than the Illuminati trying to ruin your life.

815
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,160
 Now the thing is, is like I said, I was researching this before March, when I was getting ready

816
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,680
 for season 10, I go, "I'm gonna do that story.

817
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,120
 I really like that story."

818
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,080
 The website's gone.

819
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,640
 The article still exists.

820
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,760
 You'll see links for it floating around.

821
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
 I have the link.

822
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,080
 It's in the show notes.

823
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,480
 I have the headline of the article.

824
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
 I read the article.

825
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
 I read the article.

826
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,160
 I took my notes.

827
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
 The article's gone.

828
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,640
 It's not even in the wayback machine.

829
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,960
 I went to the wayback machine.

830
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
 It's not there.

831
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,940
 You're like, "Jason, obviously a conspiracy."

832
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,880
 Well, the website had been around since 2009.

833
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
 He abandoned the article was from 2009.

834
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,960
 And the last article he wrote was still a few years ago, and it was like, "I'm moving

835
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
 to medium.

836
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,400
 It's been a hard time hosting this website."

837
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,240
 So in that article, it wasn't written.

838
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
 It wasn't written.

839
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
 Oh no, they have a gun to me.

840
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,600
 The coronavirus is coming, and I'm deleting my site because I know too much about WAMO.

841
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,800
 I think it was a website that he had.

842
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,760
 That particular page didn't get indexed by the wayback machine, which happens.

843
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,560
 The website is now gone.

844
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,800
 And it's just a weird timing thing.

845
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,720
 It's one of those things that had I not researched the story before the site really disappeared,

846
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,520
 I would have just thought, "Oh, it's a dead link."

847
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
 But because I was able to do it, and then the site goes down, it does make it a little

848
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,440
 more conspiratorial, but I don't remember if he was the one in the gate class or he was

849
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,960
 reporting on a friend or a friend of a friend, stuff like that.

850
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,480
 I just remember reading the article, taking the notes, obviously not very detailed notes,

851
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,840
 and then the website disappearing.

852
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,600
 So that is where we stand with that.

853
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,200
 Now my belief obviously is that it is just a government-run program that has a financial

854
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,480
 interest in finding the next generation of geniuses out there.

855
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,600
 But that's not a super sexy conspiracy theory, right?

856
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,680
 And neither is the WAMO one, even though that one again is more realistic.

857
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,720
 If I was a private company, I would totally do that.

858
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,520
 But if I was a company that made products for kids, you would totally, it's free focus

859
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
 group.

860
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,320
 It's 100% a free focus group.

861
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,560
 What's not free because you pay the school, but you have unfettered access to the brains

862
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,120
 of kids, and not even a mad scientist has that.

863
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,680
 You can honestly go, "What do you think of this product?

864
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,720
 What do you think about this product?"

865
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,960
 But let's take a look at the real meat of the conspiracy theory, and that's the fact

866
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,360
 that this controlling body is using it to neutralize future leaders.

867
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,120
 That is extremely egotistical, right?

868
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,720
 You were in gate or tag or whatever program you were in.

869
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,520
 A teacher identified you as being gifted.

870
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,160
 The principle, you're sitting there with your parents.

871
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,560
 The principle is talking to them saying, "What an amazing kid you are.

872
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,880
 How special you feel."

873
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
 And you should feel special.

874
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,520
 We should all, we are all special inside.

875
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,120
 But when an outsider's saying it, this person has gifts, we want to put them in this program.

876
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,040
 Things are set, right?

877
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,280
 But then as life goes on, we realize that's just not the way the world works.

878
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,080
 And even special people, even gifted people, make mistakes, unfortunate circumstances happen

879
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,080
 to them.

880
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,280
 They get lazy.

881
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,800
 A combination of the three.

882
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,600
 And you go, "Oh man, I really wish I could be an author.

883
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,920
 Really wish I could write that book."

884
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,200
 One, you can.

885
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,080
 You totally can write that book or write that song or start that podcast.

886
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,000
 There's nothing stopping you, but you.

887
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,720
 And definitely what's not stopping you is not the Illuminati.

888
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,280
 Your brain's gonna get erased when you're in the sixth grade and that's what's keeping

889
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,680
 you in your dead-end job that you're in right now.

890
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,560
 Just work, work, work.

891
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,960
 There's no longer any, this is the big trick with being an adult or being older because

892
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,240
 it gets the same thing.

893
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,080
 No one cares to help you out until you're successful already.

894
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,440
 Now, of course, you'll have family and friends that help you out, but nobody cares that you're

895
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,240
 thinking about writing a novel.

896
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,680
 Nobody cares that you're thinking about starting a podcast.

897
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,680
 You have to do those things, work really, really hard, get successful, and then the

898
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,800
 world will care.

899
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,000
 But until then, you're just like everybody else.

900
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,400
 And you have to work super, super hard at it.

901
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,800
 I've been doing this podcast a daily show, Bustin' My Butt, 449 episodes.

902
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,240
 I'm seeing growth.

903
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,440
 Or we could go back in time two years.

904
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,440
 And I go, well, my brain got wiped when I was in the sixth grade.

905
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,240
 I had this weird experience where I was in this bizarre school program that I don't remember.

906
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,240
 The reason why I'm working dead-end jobs and I want to be an author but I can't write

907
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,440
 my books because the Illuminati is keeping me down.

908
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,760
 I could have had that mindset, right?

909
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,000
 Or I could have said, you know what?

910
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I'm a creative person.

911
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Nobody cares.

912
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Everyone's a creative person.

913
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,960
 You have to put out product.

914
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
 Start my podcast.

915
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
 Start my podcast two years ago.

916
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
 We are here now.

917
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
 You're listening to me.

918
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,000
 You never would have heard me before this moment, right?

919
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,640
 You have to work incredibly hard.

920
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,440
 When you're a kid, it's different.

921
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,160
 A teacher will say that kid's gifted.

922
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
 Boom, he's gifted.

923
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
 You get this label, gifted.

924
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
 You're in the gate program.

925
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,320
 You're meeting other kids who are smart.

926
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,640
 You feel special as an adult that doesn't happen until you're already successful.

927
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,800
 Neil deGrasse Tyson would just be a guy writing stuff down on a chalkboard somewhere.

928
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,280
 If he didn't work super hard and eventually gets successful to the point that now they're

929
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
 like, "Hey, we want to do a show about science.

930
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 Let's get that dude."

931
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,840
 He didn't just wake up one day and go, "Famous!

932
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,920
 Successful!

933
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,200
 You got to work super hard at it."

934
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,000
 And this conspiracy theory says, "No, you don't."

935
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,040
 This conspiracy theory says, "You were destined for greatness, and the reason you're not great

936
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,680
 is because an outside organization stole that from you.

937
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,720
 It absolves you of your sin, and the greatest sin that humans can have is laziness."

938
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,480
 There are a lot of people who are trapped in the rat race.

939
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,800
 They're just doing the same thing every day.

940
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,440
 They wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

941
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,960
 Wake up, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed.

942
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,360
 They do that all the time.

943
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,920
 And I think a good chunk of the population, although they aspire to do better, they don't

944
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,560
 know how to go about it.

945
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,400
 Or they don't think they're good enough to do it.

946
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,200
 I think a good chunk of the population, they're not happy with that existence, but they don't

947
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
 know what else to do.

948
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,040
 Everything else involves way too much chance, so they just keep doing it and hope for the

949
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
 best.

950
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,760
 I have a smaller part of the population who strive super, super hard to realize their

951
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
 dreams.

952
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,120
 That's the part that everyone else looks up at and goes, "I want to do that.

953
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,760
 Looks too hard, too chancey.

954
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,040
 What if I do it and fail?

955
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,760
 What if I do it and I'm successful?"

956
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,880
 Nah, too scary.

957
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,760
 And then you have people that were told as children that they were gifted and special,

958
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,480
 and now they're working at a coal center or Jiffy Lube or they're a teacher.

959
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,080
 And I'm not knocking those professions.

960
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,160
 If you work at Jiffy Lube, when someone brings their car in, you're the most important person

961
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,320
 that dude's going to meet that day.

962
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
 They need your help.

963
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
 They need your expertise.

964
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320
 So I'm not knocking those jobs.

965
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,240
 But you have a group of people who have no idea how to achieve their dreams.

966
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,280
 You have people who work really hard to achieve their dreams.

967
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,700
 And then you have people, a smaller group of people, who are told as children, "You will

968
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,680
 be the future of this country."

969
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,480
 But for whatever reason, either because of personal decisions, unforeseen circumstances,

970
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,480
 these future leaders of the world didn't fulfill the potential that their teacher saw

971
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,800
 and their parents saw and their principal saw and all this.

972
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,480
 For them, waking up, working, coming home, watching TV, that is a prison sentence.

973
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,000
 It's a prison sentence because they were promised so much more in life.

974
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,900
 So you could easily say, "Listen, I made some decisions early on in my teenage and college

975
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,180
 years that weren't smart.

976
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:09,300
 And I think now it might be harder, now that I'm 34, but with hard work, I can start working

977
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,780
 towards my goals.

978
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,500
 It's going to be hard.

979
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,740
 I might have to change my job.

980
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,740
 I might have to move.

981
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,700
 I might have to do these things that are scary.

982
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:22,460
 But I want to be the person that I thought I would be when I was in the sixth grade.

983
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,120
 I have these dreams to be I want to be an author, I want to be a musician or a scientist or

984
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
 whatever.

985
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:35,920
 Or you could say, "I'm stuck in this situation because my brain was wiped by the Illuminati.

986
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,320
 That I was supposed to be a leader of tomorrow.

987
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:46,560
 And I was such a threat to the power base that it took me into a room and wiped my memory

988
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,040
 clean."

989
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,040
 The second scenario obviously sounds completely insane.

990
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,740
 But there's a group of people who believe that.

991
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,860
 There's a sizable group of people who believe that.

992
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,860
 And the thing is, is this conspiracy theory is going to get bigger every single year.

993
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,540
 Because every single year there are going to be people who are hitting 25, 30, 40 years

994
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:11,100
 old and they're realizing that they're not gifted and talented.

995
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,340
 They're just like the rest of us.

996
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,500
 And they're going to be looking for answers as to why life didn't work out the way they

997
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,780
 thought it would.

998
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,800
 They could take the answer that, "My life can be as awesome as I think it is, but it's

999
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,700
 going to take some hard work, it's going to take some risk."

1000
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:33,380
 Or they can say, "My life sucks because I was too great for the powers that be to allow

1001
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,080
 to move about unrestricted."

1002
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,520
 Living a life that is unfulfilling is the scariest story of all.

1003
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,420
 But if you can give yourself an excuse for why your life is the way it is, you will continue

1004
00:46:46,420 --> 00:47:08,820
 down that grey path until the end.

1005
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:26,020
