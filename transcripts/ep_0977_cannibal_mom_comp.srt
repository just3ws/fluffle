1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 A man uncovers a fiendish conspiracy that happens every Halloween.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,960
 And then we travel to the household of a single mother and her 17-year-old son.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,360
 On the outside, this seems like a normal family.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,240
 But little does anyone know that this mother harbors a dark and terrifying desire.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,240
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:37,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, or I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
 I'm so tired.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
 I don't know how it's daylight savings time.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
 I gained an hour of sleep.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,840
 I'm barely awake.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,440
 I'm literally sitting in front of this microphone.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
 I'm barely awake.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,360
 Hopefully I'm able to make it through this episode.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,840
 Otherwise you'll just hear a man snoring.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,320
 But someone who never hears me snore because they're so exciting to be around.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is a huge supporter of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,520
 Everyone give it up for Doomy Kins.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
 Yeah!

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,080
 Walk on in to Dead Rabbit Command Doomy Kins.

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,640
 Giving you a big round of applause.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,920
 Really, really appreciate it.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,760
 All of your support.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:24,000
 Doomy Kins listens to the podcast so much out loud in her house that her mother now

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,080
 recognizes the sound of my voice.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,960
 And when she's listening to the podcast, the mom goes, "Is that Jason?"

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
 And that's one way to get the word out about the podcast.

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
 Listen to it constantly at top volume.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,680
 So Doomy Kins, that's why you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 I do.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,240
 But like Doomy Kins, just spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,080
 That really, really, really helps out so, so much.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 Doomy Kins.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,600
 I'm going to go ahead and talk to you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy, but don't

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
 take off just yet.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,160
 We got a couple of announcements.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,440
 First off, this is the end of season 19.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,240
 This week is the last week of new episodes until December 1st.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,760
 And Thanksgiving livestream on November 24th at 12 p.m.

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
 Pacific Standard Time.

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,520
 Join me on the YouTube channel for another Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving livestream.

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,440
 This is the reason why I stopped posting on YouTube, because they were getting ready

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,760
 to shut down my account.

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,000
 They've been harassing me for months behind the scenes.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,360
 I said no more episodes on YouTube because I want to keep it up for our livestream.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,520
 So 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, November 24th.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,200
 Please turn out for our Thanksgiving livestream.

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,480
 I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,120
 They always are.

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,040
 If you're not there for the livestream, it will be available on YouTube.

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,280
 And I will also upload the audio to the podcast channel.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
 A lot of stuff going on.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
 A lot of announcements.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,440
 I can tell Doomy Kins is ready to hop in that Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,360
 So let's get in it with her.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

60
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,280
 Take us all the way out to a street, any street, on Halloween night.

61

170
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:59,840
 Ferrero, they're the makers of those really disgusting ball chocolates covered in nuts. It's like the kind of candy you give someone.

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 It's like all fancy and wrapped in gold, but it's like, "Ha ha, look at it, it looks pretty, but it really tastes like dirt."

172
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:16,840
 He worked for them, and apparently they bought up other candy brands, actually edible candies like Babe Ruth Crunch bars and Butterfingers.

173
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 And he says, "Listen, you're half right." It was really interesting. They go, "Yes, the quality of the chocolates have gone down over time."

174
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 That's true, because they're trying to save a buck. He goes, "The reason why the miniature candies taste different than the large-sized candy."

175
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:42,840
 And this is what I love about conspiracy theories, right, when we get these inside guys. Forget the big candy guy from Hershey's trying to tell us lies.

176
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,840
 This guy works for another production company, let's trust him.

177
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,840
 He says, "What happens is, as the bars get smaller, the cheap chocolate is easier to taste."

178
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 Because all the other ingredients get smaller, too. The Nougat or the wafers, like in a Kit Kat, you know, the wafers and stuff like that.

179
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,840
 He goes, "So as it gets smaller, the cheapness, you're tasting more of the cheap chocolate than you would on a regular Kit Kat."

180
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,840
 That is a rational explanation for why Kit Kats were discussing this Halloween.

181
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:26,840
 But who knows? Who knows whether or not these anonymous people online have stumbled upon something that has no effect in any way, shape, or form on how we live our lives.

182
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 But I love it. It's an interesting conspiracy theory. I tasted this one first hand. Hopefully it's not true.

183
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 I would hate to live in a world where generations that come after us go, "Hey, Mom, can I get some candy?"

184
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,840
 And the mom's like, "Yeah, what do you want?" And the kid goes, "Anything but Kit Kats." Because those taste like berries.

185
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 That's a world that I don't want to live in. I don't care what else happens. I don't care what type of dystopian hellscape is coming.

186
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 As long as the Kit Kats don't taste like disgusting berries.

187
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 Doomy Kins, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind this Halloween street.

188
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,840
 The carbonar copter is overburdened with all this chocolate. But we don't get lighter because we're eating at the rest of the trip.

189
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 We're leaving behind this Halloween street. Take us all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

190
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 [imitates car noises]

191
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 Doomy Kins, who also goes by probably one of the best Twitter handles I've seen in a long time. Section 8 Sasquatch. How's that not a movie?

192
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,840
 How is your Twitter name not a movie? Doomy Kins, go ahead and land this carbonar copter outside of this suburban house.

193
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,840
 And we're standing outside the house, looking in, peering through their window like a bunch of freaks.

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:49,840
 Now, that actually, if that was true, if somehow we were teleported outside this house, and we were staring in the window like some peeping toms,

195
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 that would be the least disturbing part of this story.

196
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,840
 And in this house, we see a woman. She didn't post her name, but we're going to go ahead and call her Veronica.

197
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,840
 We're looking at her. She's a 34-year-old single mother. Totally normal looking. Totally normal looking.

198
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:15,840
 Jason, why'd you say that twice? Is there something I should be concerned about with this woman?

199
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 Normally, people only get described as totally normal looking if they harbor some sort of dark secret.

200
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,840
 And then bounding into the house is her 17-year-old son. We don't have his name either. We're going to call him Bobby.

201
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 Bobby walks into the house and was like, "Hey, Ma, I just had a great day at school. So much fun."

202
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,840
 And Veronica, all of a sudden, she seems to snap out of a deep thought she's having. She turns around and she's like, "Bobby, so good to see you."

203
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 She walks over and she gives Bobby a big hug. And then it happens very quickly. I don't even know if Bobby noticed it.

204
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,840
 I don't know how you wouldn't notice it, but just for a sake of argument, Bobby doesn't notice it.

205
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
 We're staring right at this loving interaction between a mother and a son.

206
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 And we see Veronica. She's hugging her son. She leans in really close.

207
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 And she goes... takes a big whiff of Tommy's neck.

208
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 And then she turns to the camera and goes, "All I've ever wanted to do was eat my son."

209
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 Now, this is the story of an anonymous woman who posted back in 2013 how every single day...

210
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 Sorry, let me correct myself. Almost every single day, all she can think about is eating her son.

211
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:08,840
 She said, "Cooked or raw, doesn't matter." Almost every day, I fantasize about eating my own child.

212
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:17,840
 Now, she wants to clear up some misconceptions we might have about this... incredibly disgusting desire, right?

213
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,840
 Imagine if one of your friends told you that. They said, "Hey, man, glad we could get some coffee together.

214
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,840
 It's been a long time since we've hung out. I want to eat my kids. I want to look straight in your eyes

215
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
 and tell you that I'm joking. I want to eat my kids." You'd obviously have some questions.

216
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,840
 So she wants to get these questions out of the way. First off, she says, "Listen, I'm not a pervert.

217
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 I would wait until he was 18 years old. If I was going to eat my son, it has to be consensual."

218
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 People under 18 can't consent. So after he turns 18, I want to eat him.

219
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,840
 She wants to eat him. This is so weird. She wants to eat him now.

220
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,840
 But I imagine to kind of, in her own world, not be a... what? Like a cannibal offender?

221
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 Like a cannibal sex offender? I don't even know if there's a watch list for these people.

222
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 There should be. All the people who should be on a watch list. It should be moms who want to eat their children.

223
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,840
 Now actually, I should back up because it's so funny. I used to have a friend named Annie that I hung out with all the time.

224
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,840
 And she constantly talked about eating babies. She wasn't a politician. She wasn't a politician.

225
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 I wasn't friends with Hillary Clinton. She would constantly talk about eating babies all the time.

226
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 Whenever a baby... this is when I worked for Gateway Computers. Whenever a baby came into the store, she would go, "Oh, bro."

227
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 She would like make these noises. And I laughed because I'm a super villain at heart. I thought it was hilarious.

228
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,840
 And she goes, "Babies look like dinner rolls to me." The way that they're little chubby legs and they're little chubby arms.

229
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,840
 She goes, "It looks like those dinner rolls, like those Hawaiian rolls you buy at Thanksgiving time."

230
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,840
 I just want to eat them up. I just want to eat babies all the time. Now she never ate a baby.

231
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,840
 She never ate a baby as far as I know. As far as I know, she never ate a baby.

232
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,840
 But she would talk about eating babies all the time. And what I found out, Sabine was telling me this not too long ago.

233
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,840
 She said, "There is a desire to eat babies. Mothers want to eat their own baby."

234
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,840
 And I said, "Oh, okay. Look back up." She didn't specifically use the word "eat."

235
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,840
 She says, "Mothers actually put their baby's feet in their mouth."

236
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 Not right when they're born. They're all covered in ambiotic fluid. And they're like, "I'm sucking it off like jelly."

237
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 "Mothers want to suck on their baby's feet in hands."

238
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 And the reason why is you want to get their... I was fairly paid attention to what she was saying as she explained it.

239
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 You suck on a baby's foot and then you get the baby's bacteria into you.

240
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,840
 And then it comes out of your breast or something.

241
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,840
 Probably should have paid more attention since I want to talk about it now.

242
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
 People are like, "Oh, great. Not only does Jason know nothing about science, none of his friends do either."

243
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 She could explain it more thoroughly, but you suck on a baby's foot and then it goes into your breast milk.

244
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
 And then when the baby's drinking the breast milk, it has more immunities built into it.

245
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,840
 And again, it's not like you let your baby walk through a cat litter box.

246
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 You're like, "Now you'll be immune to cats."

247
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 It's clean babies. I think you wash them off, right? I don't think you're just letting them play on the mud.

248
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,840
 And you're like, "Mmm, nuh-uh-uh, eating them."

249
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,840
 Anyways, she could explain it better, but she doesn't have a podcast.

250
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
 So this is all you got.

251
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,840
 Moms want to suck on their baby's feet.

252
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,840
 And a friend who loved, who thought, didn't love, she never ate a baby, but she wanted to eat babies.

253
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,840
 And I don't think she even wanted to devour them.

254
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,840
 She just wanted to like suck on their little baby legs because they look like Hawaiian rolls.

255
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,840
 Well, that isn't what we're talking about here with Veronica.

256
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 It's the one, the kid's 17 turning 18.

257
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,840
 The story, she posted this on November 19th, 2013.

258
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 His birthday's in February, so it's not like this is a newborn baby and she's posting how much she wants to eat her baby.

259
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,840
 Which again, would be quite alarming as well if it's out of context.

260
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,840
 And even in context, it's pretty crazy, but she wants to eat her son, but for her it's important that he can consent to being devoured.

261
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,840
 She's not a pervert, right? She hasn't been grooming her son this whole time.

262
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 She hasn't been like, "It's back time!" and she pulls out a gravy ladle.

263
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,840
 You know, you could easily groom a kid into wanting to be eaten constantly before every Halloween.

264
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,840
 He's a roasted pig with an apple in his mouth.

265
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
 He's like, "Mom, I'm the same costume every year."

266
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 She's like, "I know, but she looks so delicious. I mean, so spooky."

267
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
 But that's not what she did.

268
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,840
 Her son has no idea that his mom wants to eat him.

269
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
 Which is creepier, right?

270
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:28,840
 Like, if your mom was constantly making jokes about eating you and was always dressing you up as edible things,

271
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,840
 dressing you up as a carrot, and you would kind of get it.

272
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,840
 You'd kind of be like, "This is super weird. Like, every night when I go to bed, I sleep in a giant pot full of warm broth."

273
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,840
 It's kind of weird. I think my mom wants to eat me.

274
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
 And this revelation kind of dawns on you over this course of years, right?

275
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
 She kept going every night, she kept going in a pot.

276
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,840
 You're like, "I think my mom wants to eat me." That would be disturbing enough.

277
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 But not knowing would be creepy as well.

278
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,840
 If your mom was fantasizing about eating you, and that's the word she uses.

279
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 Because when she says she fantasizes about eating her son,

280
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:20,840
 she says it is the single most intense and arousing fantasy she's ever had.

281
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 She thinks about eating her son while having sex with other men.

282
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,840
 I don't know how the mechanics of that work. I guess she would have to completely leave her body.

283
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,840
 But while she's having sex with men, she will fantasize about eating her adult son.

284
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
 And that's what gets her off.

285
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
 She says she even does it when she's masturbating.

286
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,840
 When she's masturbating, she imagines herself eating her son.

287
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 And she gets into some specifics here.

288
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 And you're like, "Jason, please don't. Please don't! This came out of left field!"

289
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:09,840
 The first one you were talking about, berry flavored kid cats, and then all of a sudden, it went to 0 to 60 real quick.

290
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 She wrote this online. She wrote, quote,

291
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:23,840
 "The thought of my teeth piercing his flesh, or the smell of him roasting over an open flame,

292
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,840
 or imagining the look in his eyes as I bite into one of his thighs."

293
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,840
 Isn't that the doctor suits rhyme you never thought you'd hear?

294
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,840
 These things absolutely drive me wild.

295
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,840
 And what's interesting about that, other than the fact that it's Mom wrote this about her son,

296
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 you can tell these are reoccurring fantasies over a long period of time, because they're all different.

297
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 If you just thought occasionally, "You know what? I'm really sick and tired of my son.

298
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,840
 I just want to beat his head with a baseball bat."

299
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 That's alarming, obviously, if someone said that to you.

300
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
 But you'd probably be like, "Oh, you don't really think that."

301
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
 And he's like, "Yeah, I really don't think about that."

302
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
 And he's looking over at his baseball bat. He's like, "Or do I?"

303
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 When someone can give you multiple examples right off the bat,

304
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
 that's because they've been thinking about it for so long.

305
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 Eating him was...if they just said, "I fantasize about eating him all the time," that's so vague.

306
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,840
 But they're able to say, Veronica's able to say, or just like the smell of him roasting.

307
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,840
 You got him on a spit? What do they call that? A spit?

308
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 They're cooking him over a fire.

309
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 And then, so that one, he'd be dead or being cooked alive, right?

310
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 That is a fantasy that we see pop up in some really hardcore, BD, SM culture.

311
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,840
 It's cooking somebody alive. You have them on the spit, and you can put the rod through a human

312
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 without killing them, and you can slowly cook them.

313
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 So that is a fantasy we see in that community. It's a subset, a subset.

314
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,840
 If you're getting whipped by a woman, that's one thing.

315
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,840
 If she ever brings out a seven-foot-long metal rod, you might want to run.

316
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 You might want to run, or you're going to get cooked alive.

317
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 And then the idea, the other one is while he's still alive and her biting into him.

318
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 These are all separate fantasies. She's thought about this so much, it plays out different ways in her head.

319
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,840
 And she tells it, she keeps going back and forth. She goes, "Listen, I know you think I'm sick,

320
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 but I would wait till he was 18. I'm not a pervert, and that's not the reason why we think you're sick.

321
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,840
 It doesn't matter what age he is." And then when she talks about, "I just want to eat him,"

322
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,840
 I also want you to be very, very aware of the fact that don't worry about him.

323
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 It's not like he's going to be sleeping one night, and I'm going to run into his bedroom with a knife

324
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,840
 and start stabbing him and eating him. That doesn't work. I'm not going to do that.

325
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,840
 That's actually not her fantasy. She doesn't want to jump out of the darkness and stab him to death.

326
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 She wants him to want her to eat him.

327
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,840
 She said, "Listen, what I want to happen is my son to come up to me and say, quote,

328
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,840
 she actually has a quote of how she would like this dialogue to happen, quote,

329
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:26,840
 'Mom, I know this sounds weird, but I want to be your next meal. Would you please cook and eat me?'

330
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,840
 She said, "If my son ever says that, I absolutely would."

331
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 No, I wouldn't even give him his own sleepwalk and he's having a nightmare.

332
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 She's like, "Oh, that counts." No, take-backs.

333
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,840
 And what's so weird is that no boy would ever say that to a mom.

334
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 But actually, I shouldn't say that. I shouldn't say that there's enough weirdos out there.

335
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 But a boy might say that to his mom, but what are the chances of the boy who has a desire to be eaten

336
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,840
 and also has a mom who wants to eat her son? Somewhere out there.

337
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,840
 There is probably a boy who would love to get eaten by his mom, but it's not her son.

338
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 They're soulmates on opposite sides of the planet, thankfully.

339
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
 I don't believe these two people never meet.

340
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 But she wants her son to come up and say, "Will you eat me?"

341
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,840
 That's never going to happen with this guy. I'm assuming, right?

342
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 Now, this happened back in 2013. We'll get to how this all plays out in the end,

343
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 out of all the things I could think of to possibly say to another human.

344
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,840
 That would be so far down on the list. It's statistically not even on there.

345
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,840
 I would. Would you please eat me? But that's what she's hoping, see?

346
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 But of course that's not going to happen, and she knows that's not going to happen.

347
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 She hopes for it.

348
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,840
 So what do you do when you have a fetish? I always feel bad for people who have, like, these super disturbing fetishes,

349
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,840
 because there's no way they're ever really going to get fulfilled.

350
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 I mean, you can eat somebody, but she doesn't want to just eat somebody. She wants to eat her son.

351
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 There was that big thing on the internet. This was probably like 12 years ago.

352
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 It was a blind man who liked hearing teenage boys poop.

353
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,840
 You're like, "How do you even develop a fetish like that? Like, how does that--where was that chain of events--

354
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,840
 chain of events that people were trolling him by throwing--

355
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 [laughs]

356
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,840
 --in the audio clips of stuff falling into a toilet, and because he was blind, you figure out he couldn't tell.

357
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 But he could. He had heard teenage boys poop because he would, I think, pay for these videos.

358
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,840
 He had heard teenage boys poop in a toilet for so long.

359
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 There was this daredevil power. He could totally sense it that he could tell that, "Oh, no, you just threw--

360
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 like, there's a hot wheel in the toilet. I want poop. Send me the poop."

361
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
 Well, not me. Just send me the audio clip of the poop.

362
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,840
 And I was like, "Man, that would suck to have such a specific fetish and not be able to, like, do anything about it."

363
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,840
 To have such a disturbing fetish that places you so far outside the mainstream.

364
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,840
 There's not even a support group for that.

365
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,840
 She wants to eat her son. Now, she wants him to come up to her and say--she wants it to be consensual,

366
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,840
 but of course it's not going to happen. So what do you do?

367
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 You can A) not fantasize it about anymore. Stop feeding that wolf. Get over that.

368
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 Think about something else. Or...

369
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 Now, she says--listen, my son obviously doesn't know that I fantasize about eating him.

370
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 How could you? How could you possibly think that this was even a real thing?

371
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,840
 You're living in this household, you would never ever think that.

372
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 She says, quote, "My son doesn't know that I fantasize about eating him.

373
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 He doesn't know that my mouth literally waters when I look at photos of him at the beach."

374
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 He's all putting on suntan lotion. It's barbecue sauce.

375
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 He's like, "Mom, I don't know. I see--whenever you put the sauce on me, I actually feel like I'm getting cooked.

376
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 I don't think this is a really good sunscreen." She's basting him.

377
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:20,840
 She says--he doesn't know that my mouth literally waters when I look at photos of him at the beach

378
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,840
 or see him by the pool. You know, just even that alone, right?

379
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 Could you--looking at a photo book with your mom? And every so often she turns the page, she's like,

380
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,840
 "Uhhh, she's drooling?" And you're like, "Ugh, you having a seizure?" "No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine."

381
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
 Now, let's look at the time you went to Waterworld.

382
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,840
 Why did you take 500 pictures of me at that water park, Mom?

383
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,840
 Quote, "He doesn't know how turned on he makes me." This is a mother talking about her teenage son.

384
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 She can say, "Well, I'm going to wait until he's 18, but--"

385
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,840
 Quote, "He doesn't know how turned on he makes me."

386
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,840
 When we--this is the part where I go, this almost sounds like a troll. This almost like a joke at this point.

387
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,840
 But who knows? It's very specific to be a joke.

388
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,840
 This person has never posted again. It was an anonymous post, deleted account.

389
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,840
 Quote, "He doesn't know how turned on he makes me."

390
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:30,840
 When we watch the walking dead together, and he rests his head on my belly.

391
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:37,840
 Now, this is the line that people were calling it out, being like, "This is a troll. This is a troll. This is made up."

392
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,840
 Not because they were watching the walking dead. Nobody watches the walking dead anymore.

393
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 Well, this was back in 2013, so this was like season three. This was like peak walking dead, but--

394
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:54,840
 It wasn't that they were watching the walking dead together, which for a cannibal must be like soft-core, cinematic spawn.

395
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:03,840
 It was the fact that there like no self-respecting boy or man would rest his head on his mother's belly.

396
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,840
 That's just not--that's made up. That's fake.

397
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:15,840
 And that's not true. I'm not saying that I've done it as a teenager or an adult, but this is where any sort of grooming action would take place, right?

398
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:24,840
 This type of stuff would be normalized in the house, that when he was a little boy, he'd be like, "Put your head on my belly. This is where you're gonna be someday.

399
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
 This is where you're gonna be someday. Would you say, 'Mom? Oh, nothing.'"

400
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,840
 This is where grooming takes place. This is the reason why you have families where kids are being given baths until they're 12.

401
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,840
 And I'm not saying it's necessarily like sexual grooming at that point. It could be a power play.

402
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,840
 I knew a girl in middle school who her mom made her brush her hair. Not the girl's hair.

403
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,840
 The girl--the mother made her daughter brush her hair. This still sounds grammatically wrong.

404
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,840
 The mother would make the daughter brush the mother's hair every single night.

405
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,840
 And the mother had this long hair. And I was always more mature than everyone else in my class.

406
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,840
 And I remember I was like in seventh or eighth grade. I was at St. Philanary Middle School.

407
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,840
 They're gonna love to be associated with this. Actually, it was like, I think it was K through eighth.

408
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
 I think it was all stuff. It was a private Catholic school.

409
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:26,840
 And I remember I was there, and I was with the teacher, and I was with this girl, and she said, "Yeah, my mom makes me brush her hair every single night."

410
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,840
 And she gets mad when I don't, and she'll yell at me. And then once I start brushing her hair, it calms her down.

411
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,840
 And I remember I was also in like seventh or eighth grade, and I looked at the teacher, and the teacher looked at me, and we both--

412
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,840
 it was unspoken. We didn't say it out loud. But we both know that was super unusual.

413
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,840
 That was--that may have been something sexual for the mother, or that may have been a power play.

414
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,840
 And we didn't say anything. We didn't tell the daughter that her mom was a big weirdo.

415
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,840
 But I remember when the girl said that so matter-of-factually.

416
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:06,840
 Me and the teacher both kind of looked at each other, and we gave a look. Like, we knew that that was--there's something wasn't right there.

417
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,840
 It was very, very interesting. Like, I was--that--yeah.

418
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,840
 You listen to this podcast as you're combing your mom's hair.

419
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:22,840
 You're like, "Uh, mom, why am I still combing your hair? I'm in my twenties right now. Why am I still combing your hair?"

420
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:29,840
 That's where the grooming would take place, where it would be totally normal for this guy to lay his head on her belly.

421
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,840
 They would have normalized that in the household. So that's kind of my pushback.

422
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,840
 Like, obviously this could totally be fake. Which, again, would be disturbing because if it was fake, it's also someone's fake fantasy.

423
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,840
 But that would be less disturbing than the mother actually typing this out, being her fantasy.

424
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 So, you know, getting to this, what do you do when you're locked in this fantasy world?

425
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,840
 You really want to do it, but you want it to be consensual. We already see now here that she has been grooming him in a way.

426
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,840
 I mean, there's nothing wrong with laying your head on your mom's belly, right? Again.

427
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,840
 It's up to you. It's up to you. If your mom's demanding it, then that's a little creepy, but...

428
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,840
 There probably is some grooming that's been going on because this fantasy is so intense.

429
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 I'm sure she has--even though she seems to think that she hasn't encouraged this at all, that her son doesn't know.

430
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 He may have picked up these little signs, but she says, "Listen, I want to tell him about my fantasy."

431
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,840
 "I want to tell him about my fantasy, but if I do, I'm afraid it will be weird."

432
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,840
 I'm afraid that it'll totally freak him out.

433
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,840
 I'm afraid he'll be afraid of me. Which is totally rational, right?

434
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,840
 You would be afraid of anyone who said, "I've been thinking about eating you for the past 17 years."

435
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,840
 "Think about it all the time. I think about it when I'm having sex with other men."

436
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:57,840
 See, here's the thing. Not just because it's the cannibal thing, but it's also the sexual fetish of hers.

437
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:04,840
 She does not want to ruin the relationship she has with her son.

438
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,840
 Now, again, there are people who have all sorts of bizarre fantasies and all sorts of crazy fetishes and things like that.

439
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:17,840
 They may be married and have kids and have this life, but they also have this really dark desire they want to take part in.

440
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,840
 I'm going to leave that in the world of fantasy because I don't want to lose everything I've had.

441
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,840
 That's quite common. The hell dark fantasy can vary.

442
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:36,840
 I want to just go out and sleep with whoever I want, but I'm not going to do that because I've made a commitment to this marriage and to these kids.

443
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,840
 So I'm going to not do that. I'll fantasize about it, but I'll not do that.

444
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,840
 Two, I want to go out and murder young girls. I have this dark desire. I want to be a serial killer.

445
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 But if young girls are my own, I'll just keep that in the closet and not do that.

446
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,840
 You have all sorts of horrible fantasies. You run the gamut.

447
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,840
 And most people, I think, go, "That's just a fantasy. I'm not going to do that."

448
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,840
 She's been successful in doing that so far, but she says...

449
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,840
 First, I want to tell him. Second, he'll be afraid if I tell him.

450
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:17,840
 And then she says, "I absolutely will not tell him about this fantasy until he's at least 18 years old."

451
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,840
 Which is just a couple months away.

452
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:30,840
 Once he turns 18 or he asks about it, I'm not going to mention this.

453
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:37,840
 So that clock is ticking. When she posted this in November of 2013, it's just a couple months away.

454
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,840
 He'll turn 18 and then she won't feel for whatever reason. That's the weirdest...

455
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,840
 It's all weird. I can't say it's the weirdest component, but it's so bizarre.

456
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:53,840
 Where that's her big hang-up. She's like, "I want it to be consensual and you can't consent until you're over the age of 18."

457
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,840
 "I want him to consent to being eaten, but I want him to be..." It's so weird.

458
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:07,840
 I mean, what he's consenting to is so bizarre. When you're that lost in the fantasy, it's just a weird hang-up, I guess.

459
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:17,840
 She goes, "Here's the thing. I want him to go away to college and I want him to have his own life experiences."

460
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:25,840
 Which is good. She's thinking about that. She's thinking about him not being eaten.

461
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 But to finish what she was saying, she goes, "I want him to go to college. I want him to have his own life experiences."

462
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:44,840
 Quote, "Before I introduce any sexual elements into our relationship."

463
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,840
 So that is where she really plays her hand.

464
00:41:49,840 --> 00:42:00,840
 She is going, this is so disturbing. She will let him go off to college. She will groom him. She will manipulate him.

465
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,840
 Because once he turns 18, the floodgates are open.

466
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:18,840
 She is going to, once he turns 18, begin to sexually manipulate him, have a sexual relationship with her son.

467
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:25,840
 And then slowly introduce the fantasy of eating him. That's her goal.

468
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,840
 It's a very interesting post because she kind of goes on and on and she uses all these wiggle words like, "Oh, you know, I want to put him to consent. Don't worry about that."

469
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,840
 But at the very end, she mentions introducing sexual elements.

470
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,840
 And that's how it would work. That's 100% how it would work. If she walks up and says, "I want to eat you."

471
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
 She'll never see him again. She'll never see him again. He'll run.

472
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,840
 But she will seduce her son. That's step one.

473
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,840
 And who knows what groundwork she's laid for that?

474
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:05,840
 A groomer won't admit to grooming, right? "No, no, no, I never set this up. We were just friends that whole time."

475
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,840
 It changed later on would be the argument.

476
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,840
 But who knows what she's done over the years? Just like, "Let's watch Back to the Future again."

477
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,840
 Again, mom, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's watch it."

478
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,840
 We're always going to watch those scenes with Marty McFly and his hot mom.

479
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 She's laid the groundwork for that. She's going to sexually seduce her son.

480
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,840
 And then as they engage in this relationship, she's going to start introducing stuff like,

481
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:40,840
 "Hey, do you want to use some toys?" And she brings out like a spatula.

482
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,840
 She's like spanging him with a spatula that she's flipping him over.

483
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,840
 She turns her bedroom into a giant kitchen.

484
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:58,840
 He's like, "You know, mom, it's been fun having sex with you and all, but do we have to do it in a giant cast iron skillet?"

485
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:05,840
 She's slowly going to introduce the fantasy of the sex, or the fantasy of the cannibalism.

486
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,840
 So her in goal, that is what she wants to do. She does want to eat her son, which we knew in the beginning,

487
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,840
 but even though she tried telling us it was just the fantasy, it was just the fantasy,

488
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,840
 after he turns 18, she will seduce him. She will physically, sexually seduce him.

489
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,840
 And a mother's bond is hard to break.

490
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:31,840
 Like, if some dudes get so into the mama's boy routine that no matter what girl they date,

491
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,840
 the mom's like, "She's not good enough. She's not good enough." Stuff like that.

492
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
 And you're just digging the hooks in the mama's...

493
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
 No, I'm not saying that every mama's boy is getting seduced by their mother.

494
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
 I'm not saying every mother that disagrees with her son's relationship choices.

495
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
 It's trying to bang them.

496
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,840
 But this woman is, this Veronica woman is, she wants to eat her son,

497
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,840
 and she knows that she can't jump right to that, so she's going to sexually seduce her son.

498
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
 And then over time introduce these elements.

499
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:06,840
 Now, she may never fully devour her son. It may be some sex game they play.

500
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,840
 Which I mean, it's also equally disturbing. You're like, "Jason, that's not any better."

501
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 Whether or not this guy got eaten, he's been groomed by his mother.

502
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,840
 He's paying his mom. He's paying his mom. I feel bad for this guy.

503
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
 He's stuck in this horrible situation.

504
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,840
 Whether or not he's actually devoured in the end is irrelevant.

505
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,840
 He's been trapped into his mother's fantasy. He's trapped.

506
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,840
 Now, there's a chance that, again, we don't know how this story ends.

507
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:39,840
 We know what her goal is to sexually seduce her son, and at the very least, role-play eating him.

508
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,840
 But her main goal is to eat him.

509
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
 Which is terrifying.

510
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,840
 To be raised by a mom who wants to eat you and all of the little things you could do throughout someone's life,

511
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,840
 and them not noticing it, laying the groundwork for you wanting to eat them,

512
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,840
 and then waiting until they're 18 to sexually seduce them.

513
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,840
 And then, over time, like, I mean, that'd be weird enough, right?

514
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,840
 You're in a sexual relationship with your mom. You're already, that's already kind of messing with your head.

515
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
 [laughs]

516
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,840
 Just when you thought things gonna get worse.

517
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,840
 Just when you thought things gonna get worse.

518
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:30,840
 She's trying to fowl you. She wants to eat you. She wants to cook you alive or eat you raw.

519
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,840
 Just when you thought your life gonna get anywhere disturbing.

520
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:44,840
 One day your mom walks in wearing a big chef's hat, and all of a sudden you're reenacting that scene from The Little Mermaid, and you're the crab!

521
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:51,840
 It's a terrifying story. It's a horrifying look at how a dark desire can drive a person mad.

522
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,840
 Like, this woman's insane.

523
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,840
 This woman has been laying the groundwork for years over some twisted fantasy she has.

524
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,840
 And she has all the power in the world to make it come true.

525
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
 [laughs]

526
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:20,840
 So after getting ready for Thanksgiving this year, when your mom invites you over, you make the long drive out there.

527
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
 [laughs]

528
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:31,840
 Okay, I was gonna go on this really long. You're like, "I Jason, listen, I shut the podcast off. I shut the podcast off."

529
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,840
 When you mentioned my mom calling me, 'cause I knew exactly where you were going.

530
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:43,840
 You're gonna spend the next five minutes telling me that my mom wanted to bang me and then eat me.

531
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,840
 Okay, I won't go there. I won't go there. Just here's the story.

532
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:54,840
 So this Thanksgiving when you do meet with your family or get together with your friends, however you celebrate Thanksgiving.

533
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,840
 When people ask, "Hey, what have you been up to?"

534
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,840
 You tell them you've been listening to a podcast called Dead Rabbit Radio, and they go, "Oh, what's it about?"

535
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,840
 Tell them this story. I just told you.

536
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,840
 Go, "You know that there's a woman."

537
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,840
 Trust me, you will be the life of the party.

538
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
 And then your mom's in the kitchen.

539
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,840
 Your mom's in the kitchen looking at photos of you and her mouth is watering.

540
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,840
 She looks at the camera and her eyes turn yellow.

541
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,840
 [laughs]

542
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,840
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is gonna be our email address.

543
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,840
 You can also do this up at facebook.com/DeadRabberRadio.

544
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,840

546
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,840
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

547
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
 Have a great one, guys.

548
00:48:48,840 --> 00:49:14,840
