00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Today we visit Romania to check out a mysterious mountain range and the unexplained mysteries underneath

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 and then we will summon, not literally because I'm not gonna do it, but

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and then we will summon the Ouija Demon known as Zozo.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,500
 Is it real?

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
 We'll find out today.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,500
 If I was a demon, I think I'd pick a better name, but we'll talk about Zozo today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 *Demons playing*

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,500
 If I was a demon name, yeah, I don't think I would pick the name Zozo.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
 That just reminds me too much of Bozo.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 It's a very, like, I assume that demons are kinda like bikers.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Like, I'm sure the angels got assigned to their names and God's like, "You're Michael, you're..."

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 "What's in that?" "Gabriel, you're..." "Ausereel, whatever."

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 But I'm assuming the demons, they probably had angel names and God's like, "Your name is Christopher."

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And then when they go to hell, they're like, "Man, no way, dude. I'm Agamemnon."

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Or that's actually a real guy.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 "I'm Azeroth or I'm a badden or I'm something like dope and this poor demon got stuck with Zozo."

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So let's go ahead and get started because I am already getting ahead of myself.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 You're gonna have to wait for more Zozo commentary till the end.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Let's talk about, now, okay, if you've listened to the show long enough,

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 when you heard me say we go to Romania, I'm sure a lot of you were reaching for the skip button

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 because you know I can't pronounce stuff.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And when a story takes place in any country other than America, I can't pronounce most of it.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And to be fair, there's a lot of stuff I can't pronounce in America either.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 But yes, we're going to Romania.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So we're going to Romania.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We are going to take the carpenter copter over there.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's quite a long journey, but it's a very comfortable helicopter.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's quite roomy.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's like a Chinook. It's like big.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 So anyways, the carpenter copter...

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 [mimics carpenters]

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 ...goes all the way over to Romania.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And we're going to the... Here we go, guys.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 [laughs]

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Here we go with the pronunciations.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We're going to the Busegi Mountains.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So the Busegi Mountains is a mountain range.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It's actually... Well, it's part of the bigger mountain range throughout Europe.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But the Busegi Mountains are in Romania.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And there's a few reasons.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 People have always thought there was something off about these mountains.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Some people thought it was often a good way.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Some people thought it was often a bad way.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So there's two monuments on the mountains.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 One is the Sphinx.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I got that pronunciation, right?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Sphinx.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And the other one is the Babel.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So the Babel means old woman in Romanian, supposedly.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 But it's just two big old mushrooms.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Two big old rocks that look like mushrooms.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 The Sphinx is part of the mountainside that does, admittedly, look like the Sphinx from Egypt.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But more weathered.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So you can kind of see the outline of a chin.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You can kind of see the outline of a nose and so on and so forth.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Obviously, though, when you look at it, you go, "Yeah, I guess it can kind of look like a Sphinx."

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But the idea was, the rumor going around was that there really was a Sphinx there,

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 and it just got weathered so much.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And so aliens made it.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And scientists go, "No, that's not true."

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 What happened was it was a normal mountain that just got weathered down

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and just happens to kind of look like a face.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But locals were like, "There's something mystical about these mountains."

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Now, in...

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Oh, and I do want to say this.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 There's not a lot of information, or I should say there's not a lot of well-written information on this mountain range,

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 but it is supposed to be a big deal.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 That is an interesting story nonetheless.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So in 2003, the rumor goes, in 2003, the Pentagon was flying a spy satellite looking for geological deposits.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It had like this ground penetrating beam that let it see what was under the earth.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I don't know if those actually exist, but it wouldn't make sense,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 and you'd want to know what resources were in certain areas to deny enemy access to those areas.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But anyway, so the ground penetrating satellite was shooting beams into the mountain range,

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 and it discovered a massive underground chamber inside the mountain.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Then what happened was, I'm going to read this quote from this book.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 There's a book called Transylvania Sunrise, which is a bomb name.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's a great name, and it really goes into the story of the Bussegee Mountains.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 This is a quote from it.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Okay, so it says in 2003, the Pentagon discovered, the story I just told you,

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 then it goes on to say, "Through the highest levels of Freemasonry,

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 the Pentagon was able to secure an alliance with the most secret department of the Romanian intelligence service,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 which is known as Department Zero."

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 So, and first off, the Pentagon wouldn't need the Freemasons to put them in touch with the Romanian government.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It took place in 2003, they could pick up a phone or just fly over there.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 But anyway, so apparently they had to use their Freemason contacts to get a hold of the people in Romania

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 to say, "Hey, we want to look and see what's in that mountain."

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And the rumor goes that that's the reason why Romania was allowed to join NATO.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Not because it is a kind of a choke point against Russia,

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 but it's because they have something in their mountain range.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We had the Vatican and the Freemasons and the Pentagon all going to Romania,

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 and what they supposedly found was huge underground caverns with huge chairs and huge tables made of stone.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 So it made it look like a race of giants lived under the mountains before.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 These tunnels apparently crisscross around the world.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So these tunnels, you can go into the tunnel in Romania.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So you can hop in like a little mine cart and go from Romania underneath the Busegi mountains to underneath the Sphinx in Egypt.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Okay, so then you catch a little mine cart, it takes two of us.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So it's one of those ones where you're like one person's pump in each side and moves down the rail.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It's going to take us for like eight years to do this journey.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 We can go to Egypt. We can go to Baghdad. The tunnels also go to Baghdad.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 They also go to Mount Kaleesh or Kaliash in Tibet.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And they all kind of meet in one or two places underneath the Gobi Plateau in Mongolia.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 It's this massive opening where it's like everyone's just kind of hanging out.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And it also, you can take it all the way to Antarctica.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So I just to be clear here, the stories is that you can take a tunnel from Egypt to Antarctica.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I don't care how big you are. That is a long walk.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So unless these giants had some sort of technology, that's, you'd still be like, dude, I'm not going to Antarctica.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Like I don't care what's down there. I'm hanging out underneath the Sphinx. I'm good.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So the story goes is that that's where the government wanted it because they realized there is this huge underground civilization.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They're gone now. There was no reports at least that I saw.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I haven't read Transylvanian sunrise.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But again, from what I read, there weren't like fighting giants down there.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Anything is just all kind of empty rooms.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So I read all that stuff and I was like, you know, I guess it's possible that there's tunnels crisscrossing.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Oh, actually, there are tunnels crisscrossing the planet.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 But and I, you know, there's been theories about giants in the past and things like that.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But I read the, and that was it. I was like, I hope this is kind of a dead end.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And I was like, oh, they found this tunnel that I've never heard of no other conspiracy sites to ever really talk about this mountain range.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So I was like, but then I found something interesting.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 When I say found something interesting, I simply continued to read the article I was previously reading.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But at this point, I was getting kind of bored. I was like, oh, yeah, tunnels, stone, big tables, no bodies there, no technologies.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Just even if I accept the story of it as being true, it's just much empty tunnels that go everywhere.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Then I read something interesting as they scroll down another three inches.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So from the year 82 BC to 106 AD, in that area, there was the kingdom of Dachia, kingdom of Dachia.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And the people there were known as Dachians. They were also known as Thracians.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So, but anyways, they lived in this area until the Romans eventually conquered them in 106 AD.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now, there is a Greek historian named Herodotus.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Herodotus. Now, I have to say, imagine you're born and your parents holding you a little baby boy and it's Greek times,

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and they look at you and they go, your name will be Herodotus.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And you're like, yes. And then they go, Dotus.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You'd be like, come on, man, why couldn't you just stop that Herodotus?

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 But anyways, this guy's name is Herodotus. I could be pronouncing it wrong.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I'm most certainly pronouncing it wrong. But anyways, Herodotus was a Greek historian.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And he wrote about the Thracians. They had a story.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 They worshiped this god named Zalmoxis.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Zalmoxis was their deity that watched over him.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And Zalmoxis lived in the mountains.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And I have this. This is actually from Herodotus' histories of the area.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 He just thought this was crazy. So this is referring to the Thracians.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis, a divine being.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Some call this same divine being, Gebollecius.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Every four years, they send a messenger to Zalmoxis who is chosen by chance.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So he says, "Hey, we're going to pick you and we're going to tell you the message we want delivered to Zalmoxis."

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And you're like, "Oh, okay, I'll go do that. Let me continue with Herodotus' story."

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 The mission is performed in the following way.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Men standing there for that purpose hold three spears.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Other people take the one who was sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If he dies pierced, they think that the divinity is going to help them.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 If he does not die, it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And after he has been charged, they send another one.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So basically, you get pulled out of the crowd.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You're like, "All right, I'm going to go meet Zalmoxis."

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And you're kind of suspicious because you realize you've never seen anyone come back from this ritual.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And you get there and you see dudes holding spears and other guys grab your hands and feet and they start going one, two.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And then you realize that's why no one ever comes back.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So if you get stabbed, if you die from being landing on the spears, that means it's a good omen.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 If you don't die, if you just get horribly mangled, then you are a bad person and not a good offering to Zalmoxis.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Little ritual bizarre thing to this God, but here's the weird thing.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Zalmoxis, according to Herodotus, who did the history of this area, Zalmoxis actually existed.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He was a freed slave of Pythagoras, the math guy.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And so he learned all about math and Pythagorium theorems and a bunch of smart Greek stuff.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And he went to Romania and used his knowledge to make himself incredibly rich and powerful

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 because he was smarter than everybody.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And then one day he said, "You know what? I need a break.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I'm gonna go dig a tunnel in the Buseki Mountains."

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And he did.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 He just went in and created this home and people thought he had died.

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Three or four years had passed.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And then he showed back up and was like, "Yeah, no, I'm fine. I was just building a massive tunnel system under those mountains.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 What do you guys want?"

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 People would get his advice and then after a while he'd be like, "Yeah, I'm gonna go back."

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Weird.

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 That was a weird connection because now it's definitely possible that the guy who wrote Transylvania, Sunrise,

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 knew of the legend of Zalmoxis and said, "Oh, tunnels underneath the mountains.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I'm gonna weave that into my story."

180
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But I mean, that's the most likely scenario, but it is still weird that they had this god that they sacrificed people to

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and they were able to track it back to a living person who was like, and he did take that time period

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 where he was gone for a couple years, he was gone for four years, and then he comes back out

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 and that's why they had that thing where every four years they'd have to sacrifice someone to this guy under the mountain.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Really, he was probably just a pile of bones they were sacrificing this guy to.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But it's still weird to... How often can we track a deity back to a real person, but I just realized that's Jesus.

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And Muhammad. Yeah.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Okay, so maybe it's not so... I still think it's an interesting story.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So let's go ahead and move on because I still think it was interesting.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So the next story is actually a request from a YouTube user under the name Jackie.

191
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Jackie hit me up and said, "Hey, why don't you do something on Zozo?"

192
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Now, I was slightly familiar with the name.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 I actually thought Zozo was more of like a Charlie Charlie type of thing.

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I didn't really put much credence into it.

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I knew of Pazuzu, which is supposedly like this ancient Babylonian Assyrian demon.

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And I think it was the demon in the Exorcist. I've never seen the Exorcist.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 At a certain point, the movies become so parodied that I don't think I would enjoy it.

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I don't think it'd be scary to me.

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 But anyways, so Zozo.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So the story behind Zozo is this.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It is a demon that primarily uses the Ouija board as its conduit into our reality.

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 A lot of times it will... When you're trying to talk to it, you can dress it directly,

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 but the planchette will be moving to the Z's a lot.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It will be doing crisscrosses, so it hits like Z-E-O, Z-E-O, Z-E-O, Z-O.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Sometimes people say it spells out the name Zaza, which technically isn't its name.

206
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And then other people have a more sinister story.

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 They're saying that Zozo is being contacted during a lot of Ouija experiences,

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 just using different names, because Zozo is basically like a Ouija board demon.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 So Zozo, the story of Zozo really started in 2009.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Now people, and that should give you spoiler alert, but people say that there's records going farther back.

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 But in 2009, a man posted on the internet on a website that has the reputable name "True Ghost Tales".

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But anyways, he posts on that and he tells a story about his encounter with Zozo.

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 He said that it's... He was talking to it and it was being sinister.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 He kept going back to the Ouija board, like over the matter of days or weeks or months or something like that.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 He wanted to possess his girlfriend, he wanted to possess women, take them into paradise.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And when the guy who wrote this post, Darren Wayne Evans, asked where's paradise it spelled out, hell.

217
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 He also claims that the demon tried to drown his daughter somehow.

218
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And then he claims that he asked the Ouija board, "What should I name my band?"

219
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Now, again, I don't know the exact sequence of events, but I think after...

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 First off, if I'm ever using Ouija board, and I never have, they don't really interest me,

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 but if I was ever going to use the Ouija board and it started telling me it was going to possess my girlfriend and take her to hell,

222
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I'm done with the Ouija board.

223
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 If my daughter gets drowned, I'm done with the Ouija board.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I'm assuming that he asked what he should name his band before all of this.

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But anyways, he goes, "What should I name my band?"

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And the board spelled out "Iron Tongue" and he's like, "Oh yeah, that'd be a dope name!"

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And then his daughter's tongue swelled up.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Whatever the sequence of events, if you ask for your band's name, and the band's name was "Iron Tongue"

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and your daughter's tongue swelled up, put away the Ouija board.

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But then he continued to mess around with it and he said that he went to different states,

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 totally different locations, got different Ouija boards, Zozo still showed up.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Again, dude, if this happens once, why are you still playing with Ouija boards?

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 His daughter ends up getting an infection that almost killed her because he's blaming it on Zozo.

234
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So there's three things that are possible here.

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 One, the story is creepypasta, it's 100% fake.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And the evidence to that is that there's really not...

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 There's... people say there are earlier mentions of Zozo, but I couldn't find any.

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Now, people say there are cave paintings of Slenderman, people can say all sorts of things,

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 but it doesn't actually mean that they exist.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So there is the demon Pazuzu, which people have said, "Oh, maybe Zozo is just a bastardization of the name Pazuzu possible."

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So the possibility is that he just made the story up.

242
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Second possibility is it actually happened.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 It's totally real.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Actually, I guess those are the only two options.

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I don't know why I had a third option in mind, but anyway, so he either made it up, or it's real.

246
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Or actually, no, here's a third option.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It's real, but it was coincidences.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And he was able to compress them all into one thing, so it may have said your band's name is Iron Tongue,

249
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 and then four weeks later, his daughter got stung by a bee on the tongue or something like that.

250
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Like, you could have a string of coincidences.

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But the Zozo story really took off.

252
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 There is a movie about Zozo.

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 There's tons of sites on how to, like, deal with Zozo if he shows up, how to know that you're talking to Zozo.

254
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 One of them is... it spells out the name Zozo.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 That's a pretty good sign that you're talking to Zozo.

256
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But it really caught fire.

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I think there's an intrinsic creepiness to playing with the Ouija board.

258
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It's like half board game with your friends, half communicating with the dead.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It has a very, very low skill entry.

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It's not like, "Oh, we have to lay out these eight candles and smudge the room and draw this pentagram and salt."

261
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It's just a piece of wood and a little plant shed, this little moving thing.

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 One thing, again, talking to the dead doesn't really interest me.

263
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Ouija boards don't really interest me. I think it's a parlor trick for the most part.

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 But I don't actually buy the scientific excuse for Ouija boards.

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 What they say is... because, of course, they've done tests on this.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They say that you put your fingers down on the plant shed.

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's called the ideometer effect.

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And it's... your body is subconsciously or unconsciously kind of moving constantly.

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And when you're putting your fingers on the plant shed, it's moving to letters that you want the answer to.

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So, you know, here's a quote here.

271
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It says, "The unconscious muscle movements responsible for Ouija board phenomenon seen at seances are an example of a class of phenomenon due to what psychologists call a disassociative state."

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Basically, like, I'm putting my fingers on the plant shed and I'm like, "What do I want for dinner?"

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And it's like, "E...G...G...S."

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And I'm like, "Oh my God, how did it know that I was hungry for eggs?"

275
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But I don't understand how the ideometer or the idiometer effect takes place when most Ouija sessions have multiple people.

276
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So everyone's going to have their own unconscious thing.

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I guess maybe one person pushes it more than the other.

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But to me, Ouija boards, it's... I'm in this weird gray area because I don't believe they work personally.

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But I don't believe the scientific explanation for why they don't work.

280
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Like, I think if they did work, every general would be like, "General Washington, will we win this battle?"

281
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Every politician would be consulting the debt.

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Like, if we knew that they worked, they wouldn't be toys.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 They would be... You would have to go to, like, a lab to check one out or something like that.

284
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I mean, okay, maybe you could buy one over the counter, but it would be this thing that everyone did because everyone would want advice from people in the afterlife.

285
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 There's no proof that we can talk to the debt at all.

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 If I'm proven otherwise, fine.

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I don't think they work, but I don't buy that explanation.

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It almost feels like scientists said, "You know what? We don't think these work, and we're just going to come up with an explanation why, and we're just going to stop halfway through."

289
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Because it doesn't account for all these other things.

290
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 All these other things going on.

291
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 So I'm in this weird area where I'm a skeptic towards them.

292
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I don't think they work because if they did work, everyone would use them.

293
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And they used to be super popular.

294
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 They actually started... This is kind of sad.

295
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 They boomed in popularity in America after the Civil War because everyone wanted to talk to their dead relatives.

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So many people lost so many loved ones that they started manufacturing these spirit boards.

297
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And that's just a sad thing.

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 That's why they boomed because of the loss of so many American lives, men and women and young kids and all that stuff.

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 People turned to the spiritualism.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 If they actually worked, I think people would still use them on a greater scale than they do.

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 But I don't believe that the scientists are really being...

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 I don't think the scientists are really making their case for why they don't work.

303
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So I'm just in this weird area with them.

304
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I don't know.

305
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I don't know.

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And as far as the existence of Zozo goes, that's another thing.

307
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Like, it's possible?

308
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 It's possible.

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And if they're... Okay, let's assume for a second that Ouija boards do work.

310
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And they contact the dead and they can contact demons and stuff like that.

311
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 We buy into all the stories that Ouija boards can do.

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Yes, then absolutely there can be a demon named Zozo.

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 His actual name may not have been Zozo.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It could have been Pazuzu or something else.

315
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And he shortened it so he could do that swirling motion.

316
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Or maybe because the name sounds a little funny, a little creepy.

317
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It's like a playful, jester type demon.

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 If you accept that Ouija boards work, then yeah, Zozo could definitely be true.

319
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Again, I'm skeptical on Ouija boards, but I still think that there would be demons out there

320
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 who would follow you from state to state.

321
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Like, if it really knew that it could have had a gateway into your life,

322
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 it would follow you from state to state.

323
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 But I do have to say, guys, despite all the warnings and the signs

324
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 and everything about that on what to do if Zozo shows up at your Ouija session,

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 if he does and makes your daughter's tongue swell up, gives her an affection, tries to drown her,

326
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 stop playing with Ouija boards.

327
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Like, the guy almost, the author almost seems like he had an addiction to him.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I don't know, man, hey, maybe that was part of the Zozo's curse.

329
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Maybe he couldn't control himself.

330
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Maybe Zozo was making him, in a way, communicate more.

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Or maybe it was all just really entertaining creepypasta

332
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 that ended up spawning an entire internet myth.

333
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I guess we won't know unless we break out the Ouija board.

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
