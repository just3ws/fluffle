1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Ancient China is rocked by one of the strongest man-made explosions ever.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Or was it alien made?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we travel to the Rootin' Tootin' Old West,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 where we meet Colonel York on a quest to find his missing brother.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 But instead, he finds a young woman with psychic abilities today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're just going to slide right into this episode.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We're going to get started.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Let's go ahead. We're going to go back in time.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 We are headed back to the year 1626.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It was a long, long time ago. What is that? Like 17th century?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 So anyways, it's May 26, 1626.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 We are lookouts, and we're in Tongzhou, China.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So we're about 40 kilometers from Beijing.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So in real distance, I think that's about like, I don't know, 50, 60 miles.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But anyways, maybe less.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 The point is, is that we're guards.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So we got on our little helmets, and they cover our nose,

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 and then our mouth is exposed.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So we can stab it in the mouth, we can stab it in the eyes, but our nose is safe.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 We're standing there, we're up on this lookout tower, and I'm like, "Look out!"

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And you're so tired of me telling that joke eight hours a day.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 You're like, "Dang it, Jason!"

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You keep looking around, but after like the fifth time we've been doing that, you're like, "Yeah."

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 It's not funny. It's not funny anymore.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Anyways, we're up on the tower, and we see 40 kilometers away.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I can see 40 kilometers away. You probably can't.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 But anyways, boom.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Let me just see, like, this massive explosion.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And as I'm saying, look out to you.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 For real this time, you go, "I know, I know, I know, I saw it."

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I saw it now. My eyes aren't as good, but it took me longer to see it.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And we're watching this, and then we see a mushroom cloud.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Up here, from where the explosion was.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Now, I don't honestly know if any human can see 40 kilometers.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 But these guys heard it, and then they felt it.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Oh, the lookout tower's shaking.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So they saw it closer.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I don't think any human can see.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Well, if it was a flat plane, because I know like 2020 is like,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I could read something that's 20 yards away,

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 or feet away, one of the two.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But like, if you're standing in one side of Kansas, and it's completely flat,

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 and then on the other side of Kansas,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 oh wait, I forgot the earth curves. Never mind.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Okay, so it doesn't work like that.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Anyways, you might see a mushroom cloud.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 The point is not whether or not the paranormal stories did they see a mushroom cloud or not.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 The story is this. Now we're going to go, this was happened in Beijing,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 China's current capital. I don't know what it was back then.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 But anyways, Beijing, big old city, full of people.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And inside it was the Wenggongcheng Armory.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Wait, it's one word, but I can't say it all at once.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So Wenggongcheng Armory.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And what they did here is they manufactured and stored weapons.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Part of their weaponry, of course, was gunpowder, because they invented gunpowder.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Now, normally you wouldn't want to have a massive stockpile of gunpowder and weapons inside your city walls,

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 but back then they had to, because if they put it outside the city,

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 it was more liable to get attacked by your enemies.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 People with swords poking it and the walls break open and they take all your stuff.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So they go, we're going to put it inside this mass populated wall, this fortress,

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 so that no one will get in there.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 What the story is, everyone is kind of going about their day.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 People are pushing babies and little strollers and eating apples and stuff like that.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Babies are eating applesauce.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And the little plume of smoke just kind of seems to appear inside the Wenggong Armory.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So it has a roof, obviously, it wasn't just exposed to the rain.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Oh no, we need a war and all of our gunpowder is wet.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But they see a little bit of smoke come out of the roof and then the building just disintegrates.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Like, if you were anywhere near this gunpowder place, you would liquefy it almost instantly.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Everything within two kilometers disappears.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Basically, it goes to the Twilight Zone.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 It no longer exists.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 The explosion is so...

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 The explosion is so big, 40 kilometers away, people were hearing it and feeling it and possibly seeing it.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 But within a two kilometer radius of this building, life and the universe ceases to exist.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 There was this 5,000 pound statue that was just kind of chilling by the Armory.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It ended up across town.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So that survived the blast, but it just rolled like an Indiana Jones ball.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It probably didn't roll, it probably flew.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 That would be awesome if the statue was like a guy pointing up at the sky and then it was kind of flying.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 It would give you a little bit of levity to see that statue like in a flying pose.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Flying through the sky as your skin was being ripped away from your body by the shockwave.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 20,000 people killed in the explosion.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Very, very densely packed city.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 People biting that apple and as that shockwave is coming, the apple gets blown out of their hand.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 They're like, "Oh, this isn't gonna be good."

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 In other parts of the city, people who were 2.5 kilometers away from the explosion, well, a lot of them died too.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Okay, so three kilometers away from the explosion, they saw just body parts fall from the sky.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 It was raining men body parts.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So that's the part they leave out of the song. That was the original version.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So anyways, they're like, "Ah, body parts are falling on people."

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 I don't know if they were standing outside.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I'm sure they went inside after the first arm hit the ground.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But anyways, body parts are falling down.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Some people survived the blast. I thought this part was funny.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Some people survived the blast, but their clothes didn't.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So imagine you're standing in the street and you're about, let's say, 2.5 kilometers away from this massive explosion.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And you're watching the people in front of you just kind of disappear in a puff of smoke.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Everything's going in slow motion.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 They're getting close and closer to you, and then you feel the shockwave get to you and you're like, "Oh my God, please save me. I don't want to die."

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And then your clothes fall off and you survive.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Like, that's what happened. The blast was so strong, but still it was kind of weak at this point.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They were just blowing their clothes off, so now there's much of naked people.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Okay, now to be fair, I don't think their clothes just blew off of them, and then they went home and ate soup.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Like, they would have gotten massively like, it would be like getting punched by a thousand Mike Tyson's.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So they weren't running marathons after this. They probably weren't even walking after this.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 My point being is, if you had a choice between being disintegrated or simply having your clothes shredded off of your body, you would pick the clothes.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Obviously, unless you didn't like being nude in public.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But anyways, so I thought that was funny. People's clothes got blown off again. They probably weren't alive super long after that, or if they were, they had bones of jelly.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But anyways, and they, people in town, people closer definitely saw Mushroom Cloud appear.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So, totally real event actually happened. It's in Chinese history, and that's fairly recent, like 1626.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Like, that's when everyone was writing stuff down.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But people have always wondered what caused it.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Now, of course, there's two camps. One of them says it was a natural cause.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Some people say it was a fire in the building, which is suggested by the little plume of smoke.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And other people say, no, the little plume of smoke shows something was ignited, but it doesn't show that was the cause.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So people go, yeah, the fire could have broken out. It's not like there's any witnesses that they can interview to it.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Fire could have broken out. The other one, an odd one, is that it was a natural gas leak in the earth.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Like, it was built, and the earth kind of cracked open some natural gas got out.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The earth farted, basically, and blew the building to pieces.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And since it was already so combustible with all the gunpowder, it made it even worse.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 "Yee who smelt it, dealt it indeed, Mother Earth."

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And then, some people think it could have been like an airburst meteorite that was just coming down and flattened the city.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Again, maybe, but the little plume of smoke, if that detail's real, kind of leads that out.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Then we hit--that's believable, though. Possible.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And then people say, "Nuclear explosion." Nuclear bomb went off. Time traveler.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And then aliens. Of course, aliens show up in every bizarre event.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I don't know, like, what did the aliens do?

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Like, I would like to meet someone who goes, "Oh, no, you hear about that obscure event in Chinese history?"

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, that building explosion?"

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, that's what I was talking about out of all the obscure events."

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 "Is aliens?" And I would obviously go, "What? Why?"

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And then he would explain, "But here's a question.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 If it's aliens, did they sneak in and just like, why would an alien go into a--

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 first off, why would an alien go into a building full of gunpowder to begin with?"

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But why would the alien go in there and then just like light a match?

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Like, why doesn't he use like spaceship lasers and stuff?

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It just doesn't make sense. There's aliens everywhere. It's a little annoying, honestly.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But that is the story of the Wang Gong Chang explosion.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 20,000 people dead, countless shirts, trousers, and socks remain unaccounted for.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Let's go ahead and-- I got a Dead Rabbit Recommends here that I've had for months.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I remember right after I watched it, I go, "Oh, yeah, I gotta recommend this movie."

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And here we are. Spooktacular October. I know I keep changing the name of the month.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Haunted Halloween spooky stuff.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Anyways, there's a really, really low budget-- you can kind of see your pattern.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I kind of like the low budget horror movies, the weirdo movies.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 There's a low budget movie. Probably has about four actors total in the movie,

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 but that's like at the very beginning and the very end.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The movie is basically one person, one ghost.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's called Interior. It's called Interior.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So here's a quick plot review of the movie, because it's almost impossible to spoil.

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 This movie's all about the endings dope, the endings terrifying,

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 but mostly about atmosphere and creepiness.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 It is a young couple, father, mother, and their young, like, eight, nine-year-old girl, right?

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And the nine-year-old girl is saying she's seen a ghost in the house,

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and the mom kind of gets some weird senses.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Now, they're going on vacation for the weekend, and her friend, the mom's friend,

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 is a paranormal, like, hobbyist investigator type guy,

163
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and she goes, "Hey, my daughter thinks this."

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Like, look at these creepy pictures my daughter's drawn of, like, this boogeyman.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Isn't that hilarious? House is kind of weird.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And I know you're into ghosts. Would you mind house sitting for us this weekend?

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, totally. I'll set up video cameras and everything."

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So it's basically a found footage movie.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It's almost, like, five shots in the whole movie.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I could be wrong on that, but it's mostly--it's so bizarre how much they can do with so little,

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 and how creepy the movie is.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But the movie is the guy house sitting for the weekend.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And it's one of those movies where it's a lot of stuff moving in the background,

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 like him sitting on the couch, floating through the television,

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and there's, like, a woman standing down the hallway.

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 It's that kind of creepiness.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But it doesn't stop there.

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It's actually very, very entertaining movie,

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 which I don't think a lot of people have seen,

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 because it's so low budget.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But check it out. It's called Interior,

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 and I'll include the links and the trailer and the show notes.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And, yeah, I have to make a correction, too, about another dead rabbit recommend I did.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Temporal from email sent me this email.

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I kept calling the movie "Deep Down."

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It's actually--that sounds more like a porn movie.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's actually called "Deep Dark."

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 "Deep Dark." So I'll include the links.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Yeah, he's like, "Dude, I really had, like, struggled to find that movie."

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So thanks for that correction.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Yeah, the first movie I recommend that if you've tried looking forward is actually called "Deep Dark."

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Not "Deep Down." It's not "The Abyss."

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So we're going out west. We are leaving China.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 They're like, "Won't you help us with our recovery?"

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 There's still so many people bearing under revel.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And we're like, "No, we're out."

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And so we quit our jobs as guards in China.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And now we're going to go a couple hundred years into the future.

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 The year is 1872, and we're going to hop on a freighter.

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Ding, ding, ding, ding. It's like, you know, they ring the bells.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They're going through the fog. We're leaving China.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And then we're going to end up in Kansas.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's winter.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Snow falling.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 There's a dude named George Lunker, and he has an eight-year-old daughter.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Now, his wife recently passed away, and he goes, "You know what?

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 There's nothing left for us here in Independence, Kansas. Let's go to Iowa."

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 A little girl's like, "Okay, I'm depressed."

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And he's like, "Yes, I'm depressed too. That's kind of the reason why we're leaving."

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 They get their horses together, and they set off through the cold winter to Iowa.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Now, you know, back then you go on a road trip or you go on a journey,

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 or you're just trying to leave town. It takes a while, obviously.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And you get there where you're going. You write a letter back to your buddy.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 That takes a while, too.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So if you happen to go missing, they're not going to really find you super quickly.

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's spring, 1873.

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 There's a dude named Dr. William York, and he's buddies with George.

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So George left in the winter with his daughter.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 By the time spring rolls around, he's like, "Yeah, things are slow, but they're not that slow.

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I should have gotten a letter from him by now."

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 He's sitting. He's like, "Check in the mailbox every day."

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He's like, "Oh, check in the mailbox."

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So he goes, "Something must have happened."

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Now, again, it's not just a road trip.

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 There's like, Indians shooting arrows at you.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 There's bandits and robbers the whole way.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's not like you're just hopping in your car and driving from Kansas to Iowa.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You're hopping in a wagon, and people are shooting at you the entire time.

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So it's not just like, "Oh, maybe he just doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Maybe we were not as good as his friends as I thought we were."

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's, "He may be dead, and I need to find out because I like the dude,

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 and I'm wondering if his daughter's okay."

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So he goes out.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Now, Dr. York is like traveling along, and he's stopping at homesteads,

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and he's like, "Hey, have you seen this guy?

237
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Have you seen this old-timey photograph that took us 10 minutes to take?"

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I didn't even have cameras back then.

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 He's like, "Have you seen this guy?"

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And it's just a drawing.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And they're like, "Hmm. No, I haven't seen that guy."

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He goes to the next homestead. "Have you seen this guy?"

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He gets all the way to about Iowa and says, "I'm not going to find him."

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Like, "Nobody has seen my buddy.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I hope things have worked out for him, but I got to head home."

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Never makes it back home.

247
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Now, George Lochner had a buddy who was a doctor and had the funds to just basically,

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 like, kind of go on a quest to find him.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But not everybody has those people.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Dr. York has his brothers.

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 One of them is Kansas State Senator Alexander York.

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And his other brother is Colonel Ed York, a colonel, because the Civil War just ended a few years ago.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So you basically have--

254
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 If you're going to go missing, the better connected you are, the better off you are at being found or avenged.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 One of the brothers is a state senator.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 The other brother is a military officer.

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Colonel York says, "We got to find my brother."

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 He rounds up 50 soldiers and they just start riding the path they knew he was on,

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 stopping at every house, walking in full uniform.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 "Have you seen my brother? Where is he?"

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And they're questioning him.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 They also have better drawn pictures so they can be like, "Is this him?"

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And they're like, "That guy does look kind of familiar."

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He kept going down the road.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 They stop at every single homestead.

266
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Travelers who are walking by, they stop them.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 It's the military.

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Now, it wasn't an official military mission, but they're armed and in uniform.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And it's not like the military's going to be like, "No, you can't search for your brother."

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 They're just like, "Whatever, it's Kansas."

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 If you happen to kill a couple of Indians along the way, we'll call it even.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Shoot a couple bandits in the face, whatever.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 So anyways, March 28th, 1873, they get to Osage Township, which was a town founded by these spiritualists.

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 These five families got together, they're spiritualists.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 So you have a bunch of like, kooky, hippy, old-timey hippy people in this town.

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Colonel York's like, "Great, this is going to be totally awesome."

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 "Did you guys catch my sarcasm?"

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And they're like, "Yes, sir!"

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So they're riding through the town.

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And this town is basically one of the towns you have to pass through to get further west in the area.

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So they're like, he had to have come through this town, unless he was like, off-roading it with his horse.

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So while they're in town, Colonel York is questioning people and stuff like that.

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And he sees this drop-dead, gorgeous 24-year-old woman walking through the streets of Osage Township.

284
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And he saw all his eyes bouncing out of his head, the horse's eyes bouncing out of his head.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Quite the looker this woman was.

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And he hops off his horse.

287
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 He's like, "Hey, madam, have you seen my brother?"

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And she's like, "Let me see a picture of him."

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And he shows her the picture and then she puts her hands to her temples and she goes, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 "I can tell you that he's been in this town." And they're like, "Really? How do you know?" And he goes, "Because he stayed at my inn."

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 "He stayed at my inn on his way further west."

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 "He did leave, but I think that I can actually help you find him using my psychic powers."

293
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Now, obviously, we're in this weird part of American history where it's post people, like, inventing light bulbs and putting kites in the sky with keys.

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But people are still believing in all sorts of ghosts and spiritualism and stuff like that.

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Whether or not Colonel York actually believed in psychic powers at this point, who knows?

296
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 But he does decide to go back to the inn to find out more information.

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Now, this inn is run by a family of four.

298
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 There are no one as the Benders.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 You had Ma Bender, Pa Bender, basically the Berenstain Bears.

300
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And then you had Kate Bender, who was the young, beautiful psychic.

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And then you had her idiot brother, John Bender Jr.,

302
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 who they said was a very good looking man, but he would laugh at inn opportune times, basically Joker.

303
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The mental disease that Joker suffered from in the movie, this guy had it.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Or he was just an idiot.

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But around town, he was known as an idiot.

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 The dad, John Bender Sr., barely spoke any English at all.

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And when he did, he sounded like a bear eating marbles.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Like, nobody knew what this guy was saying.

309
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Ma Bender didn't speak a lot of English either.

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But Kate Bender was this beautiful young woman.

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 She would preach around town.

312
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 She did healings for people.

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 She concocted potions.

314
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And she advocated free love.

315
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So she was kind of a controversial character in town.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 But she was very magnetic.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And people believed that she actually had these psychic powers.

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 So people would come to her from around, not just in town, but from around the region, to go to the inn and get a reading from Kate Bender.

319
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So the troop goes there.

320
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And she's like, "Listen, I can use my psychic powers to help find your brother."

321
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 But you have to believe in them.

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And Colonel York's like, "That's a little difficult for me."

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 "Yeah, as you can see, I'm a man of science. Military science."

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So if it doesn't shoot, blow up, or disintegrate, I really don't pay attention to it.

325
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And so she really is like, "No, no, I could like, you can go into town and talk to people about my reputation."

326
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And he goes, "You know what? I think I will.

327
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I think I'm going to go into town and find out a little more about this family."

328
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Good day, Madame."

329
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Tips his hat.

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 They all leave. The soldiers do. The benders stay at their place of business.

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Now, as Colonel York is walking away, getting on his horse, the other soldiers are like,

332
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 "Hey, you believe that stuff about that psychic stuff?"

333
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And Colonel York goes, "Well, I don't know about the psychic stuff, but I'm a little curious about that family."

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So they decide to stay in town for a couple of days.

335
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And at one point, Colonel York's talking to somebody.

336
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 A woman runs up to them and they go, "Oh my God. You won't believe it. You won't believe it."

337
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 "I was just at the benders' house and Ma Bender pulled a knife out and started chasing me around."

338
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And Colonel York's like, "What? I have to go there."

339
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So they go, they knock on the door. They're like, "Hey, we got it."

340
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And there's a dispute, basically. We're the cops right now. We supersede the police.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 What's going on here? Ma Bender says, "I was trying to drink this coffee and this woman was putting, like, magical witch dust stuff in my coffee."

342
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 She was trying to poison me, Colonel York.

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And Kate's like, "Listen, listen. We're spiritual people. Like, I know that might sound wacky to you, but we believe in that stuff."

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Now, I really can help you find your brother.

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But you need to leave all these people aside.

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Like, it just has to be us. Like, this psychic power doesn't work with 50 men standing around me with guns.

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Colonel York goes, "Okay. I will come back alone and we'll do this. Me and you."

348
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And she's like, "Ooh, is that a devil on Tondra?" He's like, "I don't know. I don't speak French."

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 He leaves.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Now, this time when he's leaving, his men are like, they're guilty.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They have something to do with your brother's disappearance.

352
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And his parents and Colonel York gets on his horse and he goes, "Yeah, I know they do. We just need to find some evidence."

353
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 He doesn't make the noise the horse does. They all write off.

354
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Now, at this point, now at this point, he's almost certain that this family knows more than they're leading on due to psychic abilities, maybe.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 But he's starting to get some... He's getting his own psychic feeling. Something's not right with this family.

356
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 The town holds a giant town hall meeting and everyone comes, including the male benders.

357
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And basically, it's decided at this meeting that this was the last stop, not only for Colonel York's brother, but for several other people.

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Because, see, other people had been found murdered in this area. Their heads were being bashed in and their throats were slipped.

359
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And that had been going on for probably about four years. That had actually been going on before the benders even showed up, before the town was even established.

360
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 There was a body found in a goalie with its head smashed in with a hammer and its throat slipped.

361
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 But now people are saying, "Listen, we have these bodies that we found. They're all killed the same way."

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And then we have a lot of people who may or may not pass through this area, but they never come back.

363
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So we need to search every single house in the area.

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Everyone is a suspect. And I know I didn't do it, but I will gladly let Colonel York and his men search my house.

365
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 A couple days later, this guy's riding by the bender, a state. He sees the animals haven't been fed.

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Like, that's weird. Goes up, he's picking up grains, throwing it at chickens and stuff.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 He looks in the house, completely empty.

368
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Great. He rides back to the town and he goes, "Hey, pretty sure the benders have left. Huge storm rolls in."

369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 They can't go verify whether or not the benders are actually at the house.

370
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Finally, the storm dissipates. Search party goes out to the house. It's completely empty.

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Colonel York's there with his men and he's like, "Just let's tear the place apart. We gotta find something, right?"

372
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 This is what they find. They find a trap door that leads into a six-foot-deep giant pit.

373
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That smells terrible. So it has like a stone floor. They begin smashing the floor up. They go, "There has to be bodies under here. It just smells gross."

374
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 No bodies. There was so much blood clotting the sand and the dirt in the walls. That's what the smell was.

375
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 So they're like, "We're onto something, obviously. This isn't just an accidental blood leak from the neighboring farm."

376
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 These guys had something to do with it. They climb up out of the hole. They leave the rookie down there.

377
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 They're like, "Dig your way out. Shut it and lock it."

378
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 They go, "If I was a body, where would I be buried?" And they see a bunch of sand in the garden that looks freshly tilled,

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 which would be a good place to hide a body because you're kind of always freshly tilling stuff.

380
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 They go out there. They have these probes. They're basically just sticking these rods in. They're hitting stuff.

381
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 They're like, "That doesn't feel like a tomato." They start digging it up. First body they find is Colonel York's brother.

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 They keep probing. They keep digging. They find 10 bodies in total buried in this garden.

383
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 They find 10 bodies altogether. 9 of them hammered to the head, throat slit.

384
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 One of them, the 8-year-old girl, strangled or buried alive. They don't know. But she had no wounds to her body.

385
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And then they find just an assortment of body parts in this garden as well.

386
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 So they start to think, "Okay, these dudes are bashing with the hammer and their throat slit."

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 They probably have something to do with those previous murders.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 But remember, one of them took place before the benders even got there, which has always been a mystery.

389
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But this is what they've pieced together. This is how this worked. Because two people survived this.

390
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 They didn't come out of the dirt and be like, "Ooh, what happened?"

391
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Two people got away before they got murdered. What would happen was, if you went to the inn and you were wealthy,

392
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 they would say, "You should sit at the king's seat. You should sit at the head of the table, my friend.

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 You are our guest." And you'd be like, "Yeah, that's totally awesome." And you'd go sit in that chair.

394
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Now, the chair is an old-timey thing, so you didn't build walls everywhere.

395
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 You had the dining room and then you had a curtain, and the head of the table would sit with their back to a curtain.

396
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Behind the curtain would be one of the male benders. And you'd be sitting there, you'd be eating your old-timey steak.

397
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 You'd be eating some aspic, maybe? And then the curtain would rip open and a hammer would just, pfft, hit you right on the side of the head.

398
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And then one of the women--this is all what they suspect.

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 One of the women then would get up and slit your throat open and let you bleed out.

400
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Maybe they threw you down into the trap door and then slit your throat open and let you bleed all over the basement floor.

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But they think that was kind of the division of labor.

402
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 One guy said, "I stayed at the house and I sat down and I noticed one of the males were kept hiding a hammer behind his back, and it made me really, really nervous."

403
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 This isn't like a ball-peen hammer. This is like a 19th-century hammer. They're very brutal, cruel hammers.

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They're not nice, like a little one you can get at Home Depot.

405
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He kept seeing them hide the hammer behind his back, so he got up and left. You just thought it was really weird.

406
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And then, you know, and see, again, weird stuff happened all the time. There's all sorts of weirdos in the old west, so you just were like, "That's weird.

407
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 You didn't report it to the authorities. You just went home and ate soup at your house instead of at their house."

408
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Anyways, this other guy said, "You know, it's funny. I was there, too. I went there once.

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 They wanted me to sit at the head of the table, so these people were kind of filling in the blanks.

410
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 They wanted me to sit at the head of the table, and I didn't want to because they had this gross, smelly, blood-stained curtain."

411
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I'm not sitting next to that, so he was like, "I don't want to sit there."

412
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And they're like, "You have to sit there. You're the guest of honor."

413
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And he's like, "The thing's covered in blood, and it smells. I don't want to sit next to it."

414
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And then Ma Bender grabbed a knife and went to go get him, and she ran out.

415
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 So I think that's how they were able to come up with their theories.

416
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And then he didn't report it. He just went home, ate soup.

417
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 So, all these bodies, a collection of body parts, nobody knows how many people these guys have killed.

418
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 They're not even a family.

419
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 After going through all the genealogical data they were able to come up with,

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 they believe that the Ma, Ma Bender, and Kate Bender were the only ones who related.

421
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It was just basically a collection of serial killers.

422
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 It was super bizarre. I think she married Pa Bender at some point,

423
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 but the son was just some dude who showed up. Might have been Kate's husband. Nobody knows.

424
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Because these guys were never caught.

425
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 There was a $60,000 in today's money, $60,000 reward for the capture of these guys.

426
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And there have been various stories over the years of vigilantes cornering them in this state or that state,

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and having shootouts and killing them.

428
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Stories that eventually Pa Bender died of some disease,

429
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 and they were able to match his photo against a bloated corpse's photo, so that was the end of that.

430
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 The most spectacular one was that Kate Bender and Ma Bender were caught, I believe, in Illinois,

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 and they were going to go to trial, and they denied that they were these people,

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and they're like, "You are, look at these photos. Look at these. They look exactly like you."

433
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And then the town they were being held in for the trial was like, "This costs way too much money."

434
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Because you guys don't even know if these are the people,

435
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 and it's costing us a lot of money to keep these guys prisoner, and they let them go.

436
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 So maybe they were Ma Bender and Kate Bender? Maybe they weren't.

437
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Nobody knows. These people were never ever caught.

438
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But if you think that their little scheme stopped,

439
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 so what they were doing was they were killing people, taking their money,

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 and then selling the goods to other people in town,

441
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 if you think this stuff would stop, you know, they're like, "Well, that didn't work out. Let's just leave."

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 So after the Benders left and they were searching the house and everything like that,

443
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 they found a Roman Catholic prayer book in the house, and it had notes written in German,

444
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 and they translated these notes.

445
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Here's one of the notes that was in this book.

446
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 "John Gebhart came to America on July 1st, 18, question mark, question mark."

447
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And then there was another note that said,

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "Big slaughter day, Jan 8th, hell departed."

449
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So this wasn't a one-off scheme where they were like,

450
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 "Hey, you know what we should do for extra money? Bash people's heads in."

451
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Ma Bender had been married, I think, five times before she ended up in this group of people.

452
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 All of her previous husbands died of head injuries.

453
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 True serial killers. And America's first serial killer family.

454
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Being a serial killer nowadays, I imagine, would be quite difficult.

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 People still do it, but I imagine it'd be quite difficult with all the evidence gathering

456
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 and CCTV cameras and everything like that.

457
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But for serial killers to operate in old timey west, where people just disappeared all the time,

458
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 people died violently and it was just considered, "Ah, that's what happens when you try to leave Kansas

459
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 and go to Iowa."

460
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It is a risk that you will get an arrow in the neck.

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 For serial killers to operate in an area like that would be far, far easier.

462
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 You'd think the body count wouldn't be so high because there'd be less people in the population,

463
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 but they racked up, within a year, they racked up 14 kills.

464
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And a collection of body parts, and they have no idea where those came from.

465
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 The old west of America was brutal.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 You had a hope in a new future, but it was very, very hard to get to that new future.

467
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 You had to drive your horses through snow, through heat, through arrows, through gunfire.

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And then write when your destination is in sight.

469
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 "Kind young woman claiming to be a psychic invites you in for the night and offers you the seat of honor at the table."

470
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 If their last victims weren't so well connected, this scheme would have gone on for much longer.

471
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And honestly, it probably did anyways.

472
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 They probably reformed up or did it separately.

473
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Truly earning the nickname they have today, the Bloody Benders.

474
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
