1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 A conspiracy so weird, so deep that you can't find anything on it.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Today on Dead Ravvo Radio.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Ravvo Radio.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 We've been running into some technical issues.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Some audio issues the past couple episodes.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We've missed an episode because we were working on them.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Because of that, and because I want to make sure that we can correct these issues,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm actually going to keep this episode short.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I've actually already recorded it twice.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 There's still something going on, so I think we might have figured it out.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 But again, I've recorded two half hour versions of this episode,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 and I'm taking a bunch of stuff out, and this one's going to be shorter than normal.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm not super short, but we're just going to do some quick little story bits,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 and then get into this conspiracy that, you know, I like to source my stuff.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I like to have my, say, these are the links for all this stuff, but it's gone.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It's gone from the internet.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I can't find the sources that I used to have on this.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Quick, quick notes.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 You guys can let me know if you're interested in this or anything.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So the other day, I was reading this article about the, there's a group called,

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 there was a cult called the Children of Thunder, and there was a guy in it named Justin Helzer.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 It was a cult, it was three guys.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It was two brothers and the younger brother's girlfriend.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But Justin Helzer was so enthralled to his older brother, he would do anything for him.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 They believed that they were going to be able to kill or take over the Mormon church.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 They were either going to kill the leadership of the Mormon church,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 or simply just take over the Mormon church.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 They were going to use it to spread joy, peace, and love.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 They had a bunch of crazy schemes with getting a bunch of underage girls from Brazil

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 to have sex with people and a black male for money to raise an army of, again, Brazilian orphans,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 to lay siege to the main Mormon temple in Utah to wipe out the leadership and to take over.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 They eventually ended up trying to extort some old people for money.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 They murdered about five people over the course of a weekend through a bunch of body parts

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and some duffel bags dropped them in the river.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 They're caught.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 There's all having it back in 2000.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I remember when the duffel bags were being floating through the river

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 because that was in California and I was living in there at the time.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Not in the river. I was living in California at the time.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 That aside, the reason why I was thinking about this was so just then I found out

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 that he, Justin Helzer, the younger brother, he hung himself in jail.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I'm reading the article and again I've talked about bearing the lead

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 where you kind of put the important thing in the middle of the story, not at the beginning.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The article saying, "Yeah, he hung himself," and I'm kind of reading it and stuff like that.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 It's kind of the wrap up to this whole story.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Then it goes, this comes on the back of a previous suicide attempt

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 where he ended up blinding himself and I thought,

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 "How do you blind yourself committing suicide? Electricity can happen."

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 People try to electrocute themselves and they go blind

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 or a big electrical shock can fry your eyes out.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 He tried to kill himself by sticking needles in his eyes.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I know suicide methods are not easy to come by in prison,

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 but I don't, I mean, how long would those needles have to be

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 to go through your eyes and to your brain?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And why would you try both eyes if one has already failed?

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I mean, that, I guess he really wanted to kill himself.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He was obviously mentally disturbed if he killed five people over the course of a weekend.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But I mean, you're sticking those needles in your eyeballs.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You stick the first one into your right eye and you're in incredible pain

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and you're still alive and you go, "Well, must have to go through the left eye too."

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 How a blind man kills himself by hanging himself is how he eventually did it.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I'm not entirely for sure, you know, but maybe he had help

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 or maybe he was just super determined.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The reason why, so for whatever reason that I was like,

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 "Pit needles in the eyes to kill yourself. That's horrible."

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Then that reminded me of something.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I don't know if this is something I particularly want to do

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 because it's gruesome, but some of them are hilarious.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 So Marquis de Sade wrote that book, 120 Days of Sodom.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And I've read the fourth section of it.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And now, see, Marquis de Sade wrote it while he was in an insane asylum.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And Marquis de Sade is where we give the name Sadism.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And the book, it's an escalating list of terrible acts.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So the first three are kind of this narrative flow

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 where I think it's like four or five of elite, these elite Italians

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 or French aristocrats go to this castle and they engage in the most pervert--

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 and when I say perverse, I mean perverse activities and they get worse and worse and worse.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And the fourth one, he was never able to finish,

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 he basically just wrote a list of tortures.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 They would make the producers of saw wet.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 These are the most gruesome tortures ever.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So some of them are actually kind of hilarious because they're so ridiculous.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So if you guys want me to do every so often throw in a funny Marquis de Sade torture,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 I will, but again, it can be a little heavy.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's all fictional, none of this ever happened.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 But I always thought one of the funny ones, there's some dark ones too,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 so maybe they're not all funny.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But one of them was, he wanted to put two-- he wanted to take two pregnant women.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 This is where we're going, guys.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He wanted to take two pregnant women, curl them together like the ying-yang symbol,

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 put them in a cannon, like a cannonball, and shoot them out of the cannon.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It's just bizarre.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's completely bizarre.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And I'm reading these, like, there's a ton, there's basically I think 40 per section.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So I think there's 40 of these.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I remember reading that and thinking this would be perfect for a saw movie.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It's like, you have to choose.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 There's three pregnant women in the room.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Only one will leave.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 There's a key, a new floating in this big fetus carcass in this river of shit.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 The person who finds the key will not be turned into a cannonball.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I don't know.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I don't know.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Maybe actually, now that I say that, that might actually be the funniest one.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 The rest of them are pretty disturbing.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 One of them is you throw a woman and her kids in, they find like a poor woman and her, like, her like, destitute kids.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 You lock them into a cell and see which one she eats first.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So maybe, maybe I guess I think I've already probably exhausted the funny Marquita Stott tortures.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It's a cannonball one.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 The rest of them are pretty grisly.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 But if you are a producer of a saw movie or any sort of movie like that, I would, I don't want to recommend reading them because they're pretty disturbing, but it does give you a wealth of ideas.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 So we're going to go ahead and get on with the episode here.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now, this is a weird one because it's going to deal a lot with a bunch of broken links, misinformation, and a simple phrase that I remember and have seen repeated a few times.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 But now is changed or gone.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And this is about an alien race called the conformers.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Now, who are the conformers?

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Well, nobody really knows.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Supposedly, the information that I came across, and I think this is back like in 2010, I heard about an alien race called the conformers.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Now, what I heard was that one, they are the only alien race humanity has ever made contact with.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 There are no grays, there are no reptilians, there are no Nordics.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 The rest of that stuff is made up.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 The only ones that we have ever run into are the conformers.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Two, they're silicone based.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They are not carbon based.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They are giant rocks.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Three, when they talk, you know, quote unquote, it sounds like pebbles dropping into a mess.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Dropping into a metal bucket.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Four, they are extremely violent and cruel.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 That was the information I came across.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I was instantly intrigued because it was different than any other type of alien race I had heard of.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And I remember researching it back then, and I found a couple resources and they all had pretty much that same set of information.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 There's not a lot of stuff out there, but it all had those thing steps.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And it always stuck with me because the idea of, I think one thing that a lot of people forget, or a lot of people don't understand is that

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 alien and alien, if they're not from Earth, if they're not like I've said before, UFOs may be from this planet,

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I think that's more likely than coming from another planet.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But if they come from another planet, their DNA would be completely different than ours.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 The idea of somebody evolving, a race evolving on another planet, having two arms, two legs, two eyes, a mouth is statistically improbable.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Here's the thing, if you look at a tree in the fall, if you look at a tree with no leaves on it, with the trunk and then the branches turning into other branches

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and turning into other branches, it looks identical to a human's nervous system.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 When you look at a human nervous system that's been stripped of everything, they have those photos, and it's just like a cadaver, but it's just the nerve endings.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 That's what a tree looks like because we share a DNA, we share an evolutionary path.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Everything on this planet has shared resources, has a shared origin.

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It wouldn't be the same on another planet at all.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 There's different biological factors, there's different environmental factors, everything's different.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's another planet, the only thing that's the same would be dirt.

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 The fact that it's a ball of matter, and even then if it's from a gas giant, then again, all that's out the window.

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So the idea of these reptilians, even though they're reptiles, showing up and be like, "Hello, stranger, I also have fingers," and all this stuff, it's completely ridiculous.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But a rock creature, I don't know how they move. See, that was again, there wasn't a lot of detail on these things.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Now, I always found that very intriguing. I wanted to do an episode on it, and for about the past week, I've been gathering resources and I realized something.

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 They're gone. There's two types of web pages that deal with the conformers.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 There's dead links. When you click on them, this page has been removed, this blog no longer exists, which happens.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I understand that. But what's weird is some of them are actually like UFO Digest, like some of them are actually like UFO Report.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 These are websites that are dedicated to this. I get the blog not being around anymore, but the website's still up, but the page you requested does not exist.

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And these websites, they catalog this stuff. This is what they do. The rest of their pages are up, but nothing on the conformers.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So that was very suspicious. And also, resources, any information on these guys is incredibly rare.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So there was a group of, there was a duo of brothers called the Pickering Brothers, and they met with someone they called Source A.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Now, right now, the Pickering Brothers are the only, and Source A are the only way you'll find anything about the conformers.

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And it's different. The information is different than what it used to be.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So the Pickering Brothers say that Source A says, "Yes, there are a race of beings called the conformers. They're 90% silicone, 10% carbon. They have arms.

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They sound like pebbles dropping into a metal bucket, but they're also jelly, different colored jelly. They're not no longer a rock creature.

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They're known as stinkies because they communicate via smell. They smell like burnt popcorn, and they can change the smell they emit to communicate with another stinky.

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 They hate the grays. They're ultra-religious. They've been here for 6,000 years, and the grays are trying to get them to leave Earth,

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 but the stinkies have decided to stay because their religious God wants them to convert or destroy us.

167
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 That information is wildly different than the information that that was out 10 years ago.

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Wildly different. A little more detail in some places, radically changed than others.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Even though the information is out there, the Pickering Brothers are saying, "Yes, yes, they are an official, the quote-unquote "official race" now.

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Most UFO investigators have never heard of these guys, and I know what you're thinking.

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Jason, they've never heard of them because they're fake, and they're made up, which is possible, which is likely, let's be fair.

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 But again, it's weird because people whose job is to catalog this stuff and people who make money by hyping this stuff up,

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 you think they would be, "There's a new race. They're called the conformers," or "Aka stinkies."

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 These guys don't exist. These guys, there's nothing. When I say "don't exist," I mean on the Internet.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 There is almost zero resources on them.

176
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And the main resources we have now are completely, completely different than the resources from before. Why?

177
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Why? Even for the people who make money believing in this, or for the people who are making it up to make money?

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 They don't know about them. They don't exist.

179
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 The Bigger Ring brothers are really big in the disclosure community, so it's not like these are just guys who are...

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You know, it's not two guys with a YouTube channel. These guys are actively pushing disclosure, so they've acknowledged the conformers,

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 but nobody else's. They're not in these big lists. The webpages are going blank. The information's been changed.

182
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 What's going on?

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 To be honest, I debated whether or not to cover the conformers, because I don't believe...

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Whenever I come across stuff and people be like, "You know, we wrote this, and the government revealed that this was this,"

185
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 but then the government took it down so you can't prove it like golf rumors.

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 They said the political article was up, but then it was removed from the Internet.

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And in that episode, I was like, "You can't remove stuff from the Internet. It's out there."

188
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 This isn't here anymore.

189
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 The resources that I had aren't there anymore.

190
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 The Pickering Brothers account is close enough, so you still see those key details.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 They also say it sounds like pebbles dropping in a metal bucket.

192
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 They're not rocks now. They're gelatin. They're not the only species. They work with others, but the initial idea of them being silicone...

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The name, them being silicone in the way that they make that sound, that's all the same.

194
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So obviously, they saw the same source I did. They added stuff on.

195
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Did they do that for disinformation?

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Did they do that because the myth has simply evolved?

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Or did they do that?

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Is it possible that this story is being suppressed by somebody?

199
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Is it possible that there is a race of aliens called the conformers that are the only alien race we've met, they're silicone-based, and they're incredibly violent?

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I mean, anything's possible.

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But before I started researching this again, if you told me that stuff could get scrubbed from the Internet...

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And you couldn't find anything on it after eight years, I'd go, "Well, you know, yeah, blogs can go out and web pages can go out."

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And you go, "No, no, no, Jason, I mean, it's gone or changed."

204
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I should say with this caveat that I was able to find bits and pieces of the original description of the conformers online, but again, bits and pieces.

205
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And they all... I found some resources that talked about them being rock-based and stuff like that.

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 One of the websites I had to consult was a foreign website that I had to translate.

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It was like a Spanish website that I had to translate into English, and that article is very dismissive of the idea.

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They don't like aliens, and that's fine. It's good to be skeptical.

209
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But it's just one of those things, like...

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I'm kind of speechless.

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I don't like to do stories that I can't source, but this one's just going to be a bunch of websites that contradict what I've said

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 or just have a simple paragraph of what I said or not much of anything.

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I would ask you guys to help me on this one.

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 See if you can find out any more information about this race called the conformers.

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And let's see if we can dig something up.

216
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It could have been erroneous information.

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It could have been completely made up.

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But if both of those things were true, why can't we find anything on it anymore?

219
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be the email address.

220
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So yeah, send me anything you find there.

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 You can also hit me up at facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 You can also hit it, get us at Twitter, which is JasonOCarpenter@jasonocarpenter.

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Let's see what we can find out. Let's make this a team effort.

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Because I would love, honestly, if this turned out to just be some big scam and it came out,

225
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 that would be awesome.

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Again, just an answer to the mystery.

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So if we can trace back to see if somebody made it up,

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 if we could see that maybe the Pickering Brothers made it up and they've just changed,

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 they've tooled the myth as time has gone on, let's find out.

230
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I don't mind getting dismissed.

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You know, getting saying, "Yo Jason, this isn't true."

232
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And let's be fair.

233
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Again, I'm not a big proponent of aliens coming from other planets.

234
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I think that's very, very unrealistic.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I agree more with aliens coming from another dimension or aliens already have been here.

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But if they did come from another planet, they would be completely alien to us.

237
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Have a great one guys.

240
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
