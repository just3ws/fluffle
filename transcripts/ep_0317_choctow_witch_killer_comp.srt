1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
 An ancient river curse is started when three men believe a stupid rumor.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,480
 And then we travel to Oklahoma, the year 1898, and a minister has been pushed to the brink

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,960
 by witches in his community.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,840
 And there's only one way he knows how to stop them.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:34,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you're having a great

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
 day too.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,280
 A little bit of a head cold, so my voice might sound a little more hoarse than normal.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,640
 I can feel it in my nose, I can feel it growing, I can feel the mucus just hanging out in there.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
 Remember those music commercials?

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,840
 I don't watch television anymore, not because I'm a snob, but because I'm too busy.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
 Remember that little music guy with the little white tank top on?

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 He'd always be.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 That I think is the best interpretation of what mucus would actually be like in real

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
 life.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
 It would be really disgusting.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,240
 I don't think mucus, if it was turned into a...

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,520
 Remember that movie, Osmosis Jones?

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,320
 This movie, okay, this episode just becomes me saying remember stuff.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,680
 Let's move on to the first story.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,120
 I was saying that white blood cells would probably be cops.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
 That was the...

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,880
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,160
 Remember when I used to actually do stories on this podcast?

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,240
 Let's hop in the carpenter copter.

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,680
 We haven't been in that thing for a while.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,560
 We're gonna hop in the carpenter copter and we are going to Maine, the state of Maine.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,520
 So I have no...

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,640
 Maine is what the state of maple trees and rich people.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
 And there's probably like one bad neighborhood where they don't have a maple tree and they're

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,520
 only upper middle class and everyone's like, "Oh man, look out for those guys."

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,680
 They don't tie their sweaters around their neck and they only drive 2017 model cars.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,560
 Everyone's like, "Eww, gross."

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,840
 Holding their purse close to them is walking through this neighborhood.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,880
 Anyways, we don't have to deal with any of that.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,160
 We're going back in time too to the year 1675.

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're at the Sacco River in Maine.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
 So Bubbling River.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,240
 It sounds more like a burning building, but trust me, it was a very peaceful, beautiful

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
 river.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,160
 And by the river, there was a group.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,280
 There was an Indian tribe called the Soco Keys.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
 Soco Keys, right?

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,440
 And the Soco Keys was led by their chieftain, Squandro.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
 Squandro.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,160
 Now, I recently did an episode about a boat named the Squando and while I was doing some

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,520
 deep research on that, this dude popped up.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
 So there's that connection.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,880
 There's nothing to do with the rest of the story.

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,480
 I just thought it was interesting.

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,240
 Squandro is the leader of this Native American tribe.

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,160
 Now he has a wife that he loves very, very much.

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,200
 Little baby, little baby boy too.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
 And he's a very, very proud leader of this tribe.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,120
 But one day when he's away, his wife and his son are chilling by the river.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
 Now it's a baby.

58
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,440
 It's not even like a three-year-old or nothing.

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,960
 It's like a tiny little baby person, right?

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,160
 And the wife and the baby are hanging out of the river.

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,680
 Now while this is going on, there are three white dudes walking through the bushes.

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,120
 I mean, they weren't stalking these people.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
 They were simply walking through the area.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,000
 But when they saw the woman and the baby, one of the dudes, one of the settlers turns

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,640
 to the other two and goes, "Have you guys heard that rumor?"

66
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
 And the other guy's like, "What are you talking about?"

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,080
 That's very vague.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
 The world is full of rumors.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, but that one specific rumor."

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,000
 I heard that an Indian baby can dog paddle from birth.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,320
 We Europeans, we breaststroke.

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,960
 That's the more advanced type of swimming.

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,920
 We have to learn to breaststroke.

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,400
 But Indian babies, they will dog paddle right when they're born.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 Now it is interesting because have you ever seen those disgusting videos of women giving

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
 birth underwater and the babies kind of like move?

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
 Kind of like...

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,960
 Now, they're not full on dog paddling, but they do seem to kind of like naturally know

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
 how to swim.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,200
 You know, they also say, they did this study that if you take a mom, this is going to sound

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,720
 horrible, but if you take a mom and she's dead, the baby, they've seen this happen on

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,440
 like war-torn countries.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,560
 A newborn baby that's resting on a mom, right?

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,960
 And she dies because it's malnutrition or she's shot or whatever.

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
 There have been observations.

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
 Sorry, guys.

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,480
 This is kind of a dark episode.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,120
 But this is fascinating.

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,880
 There have been observations that the baby will pull itself up, not straight up like

90
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,720
 Tomb Raider climbing all the way up, but if the baby is somewhere near the nipple of the

91
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,760
 mother who's unable to feed it, the baby can actually move a couple inches up to latch

92
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
 onto the nipple.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,920
 Medical personnel who have seen this said that is impossible.

94
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,440
 The baby doesn't have the musculature to move at all.

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
 They're just like a little doughy ball of organs.

96
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,760
 But they said, "We've seen it."

97
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,200
 Now, to be fair, I don't know why the medical personnel just didn't pick up the baby and

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,440
 move it over or give it some simulac or something.

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
 But apparently that's possible.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,600
 So babies can do weird things right out the gate.

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,480
 And it was funny I was reading the article about that and they said, "While that may

102
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,920
 just be a legend, why that may not actually be true, they can't test it because they just

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,520
 can't take a newborn baby and then be like, "Okay, mom, pretend you're dead for 10 minutes

104
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
 because the baby doesn't do it right away."

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,640
 The baby was not like, "Ooh, I guess I'm born, time to eat."

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
 And then crawls up there.

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,360
 Like, as the baby's getting hungrier and hungrier and the nipple's just a few inches away, the

108
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
 mom's laying there.

109
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
 The baby goes, "Some time if you want something done, you gotta do it yourself."

110
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 And climbs up there.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,160
 So they can't replicate that.

112
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,560
 They can't take a newborn baby, knock the mom out and do that.

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,400
 But anyways, it's the point of all that was, the Europeans go, "I bet you that baby can

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
 dog paddle right away."

115
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,680
 And again, a baby can sometimes paddle right out of the vagina.

116
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,920
 Maybe that's not true.

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
 Maybe that's not true.

118
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,440
 Maybe I'm thinking of something else.

119
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,480
 Maybe I'm thinking about a Nirvana album cover.

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,000
 But anyways, don't try it.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Don't try it.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And that's what these guys said.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
 They go, "If you throw a baby, the baby can dog paddle right away."

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,360
 So you know where this is going, despite that six-minute segue.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
 The Europeans walk up.

126
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
 They're like, "Hey, lady, let me see your baby."

127
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,200
 Now she's obviously like, "No way.

128
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 I'm not going."

129
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
 But there's three of them.

130
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,680
 There's one of her.

131
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
 And they're like, "Come on, just give us your baby.

132
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,680
 All we're gonna do is throw it in the water and watch it swim and then we'll give the

133
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
 baby back."

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now she knows, obviously, that this is a bad idea.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,120
 But they do grab her baby from her and throw it into the water.

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,640
 And immediately realize that they turn to each other and go, "I guess the rumor isn't

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 true."

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,720
 Baby just goes down.

139
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,880
 The mother then jumps into the water and pulls her baby out.

140
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
 Saves her baby.

141
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,840
 But hours later, the baby died.

142
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 So sorry, guys.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,160
 There's versions of the story where the mom also dies, like the baby fell into the water

144
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,480
 and drowned and she--dark episode, I know.

145
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,840
 Baby drowns and then the mom jumps in and she drowns.

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,440
 But whatever that part of the story is, what we know historically is that the chieftain's

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,480
 son died after an incident between settlers and his son in the water.

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 We know that.

149
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 That's a historical fact.

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
 Died a couple hours later.

151
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 We don't know.

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 Died at the time.

153
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 We don't know.

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,160
 But what happened then was Squandra was so infuriated by what had happened.

155
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,600
 So mad that he went to the river and placed a curse on it.

156
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:44,680
 And he curses it and he says, "Every year this river will claim three lives until the white

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,840
 men are gone from the area."

158
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,200
 He made the lightning bolt noise and then turned and walked away.

159
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,600
 So then that really started a thing where you did not go to the river to hang out, to

160
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 get your tubing on, to go catch some rays until three people died.

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,240
 It was one of those things like, "Hey, what are you doing this weekend?"

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
 "Ah, you know, I really want to go to the river but only two people have died yet."

163
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,480
 And you're like, "Yeah, if only someone would hurry up and become deceased in that river,

164
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,680
 then we could have fun."

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,400
 The mayor is waiting to have the big river festival and he's like, "Come on, come on.

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 One more person.

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
 This throw a homeless person in there."

168
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,520
 This story went on for a long time.

169
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,020
 And in 1947, that was the first time that three people didn't die in the river that year.

170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,720
 And the newspaper actually ran a headline.

171
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,080
 It was the main Sunday Telegram newspaper.

172
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,400
 In 1947, they run this headline, "Saco River Outlives Curse of Indian Chief."

173
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,680
 It was something people took so seriously that when three people didn't die in that

174
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,360
 river, it was announced in the news.

175
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,920
 And ever since then, that curse seems to have been broken.

176
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,800
 Was there any real thing to this curse?

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
 Now what's interesting was this story originally happened back in the 1600s.

178
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,560
 It wasn't until 1880 that we see a first mention of the curse.

179
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,380
 So most likely what happened was, the event was real.

180
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,440
 It was a contributing factor, a main contributing factor in a massive war that took place back

181
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,280
 in the 1600s.

182
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,840
 And then over time, people saw a weird coincidence happening.

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,360
 And then they tried to figure out a reason for the coincidence and made up the story

184
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
 about the curse.

185
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,320
 It seems like, think about it, if your kid was killed, you're not going to be like,

186
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,960
 "I will take to the streets, fight crime, and arrest three people a year."

187
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,460
 You would say, "Every white person who ever comes in this river is going to drown."

188
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,980
 And at home, their kid will drown.

189
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
 It doesn't matter.

190
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,460
 Sitting in a crib, watching television, all of a sudden, just water bubbling out of their

191
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,460
 mouth.

192
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,380
 Now maybe curses, maybe like, you can only do so much with a curse.

193
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,460
 Maybe that was the best curse power he had built up.

194
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,220
 But you know, why three?

195
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,460
 Why just three a year?

196
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,900
 Why not three a month or three a day?

197
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,700
 I don't think the curse...

198
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,840
 That is an interesting question, though.

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,800
 Do curses, can you only curse so much?

200
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,680
 There's actually a curse going on right now with the Los Angeles Kings, the hockey team.

201
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,960
 Because they put up, not them, the Staples Center put up a banner saying, "Congratulations,

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
 Taylor Swift.

203
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,400
 You've had more concerts here than any other musical artist.

204
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:35,240
 And ever since that banner has been up, the LA Kings have not won a Stanley Cup."

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,100
 And actually the year after it was put up, they were the second worst team in the league

206
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,820
 and the worst in their Western Conference division.

207
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,100
 So now, the season, they've covered it up.

208
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,220
 They won't let people see this banner.

209
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,420
 They believe it's cursed.

210
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,860
 At least the fans believe it's cursed.

211
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,180
 So it's been covered up.

212
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,580
 But here's the thing, so if that is an actual cursed item, would the curse follow them to

213
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,860
 away games?

214
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,980
 Like how much power does a curse have?

215
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
 I don't know.

216
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,440
 All I know for a fact, don't throw babies in the water.

217
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,160
 And also it's probably not a good idea to run studies on how mobile children are, just

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
 in general.

219
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 Just in general.

220
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,740
 Let's do a quick Dead Rabbit Recommends here.

221
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,200
 You wake up, you're standing on a red circle in a black room.

222
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,300
 Around you are other people, a hundred people standing in their own red circle.

223
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,380
 They're all standing in a giant circle.

224
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,080
 In the middle of this black room is a red dome.

225
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,420
 And you see someone in the group also wake up.

226
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,180
 They take a step off the circle and are immediately killed.

227
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,120
 This movie is called Circle.

228
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
 It's on Netflix.

229
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,820
 I think it might be a Netflix exclusive.

230
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,340
 It came out a couple years ago.

231
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,340
 Again, it's one of those movies that I think going into, you can go into it with as much

232
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,700
 knowledge as the characters themselves, which is how I experience.

233
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,780
 I love not watching trailers, just putting movies in.

234
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,780
 And I did that once.

235
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,180
 I was watching this movie and I thought it was a horror movie and it was a lesbian love

236
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,460
 drama and I kept waiting.

237
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,500
 There's this woman who was like a roofer and then there was this hot married woman like

238
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,780
 this ad manager or something like that.

239
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,580
 And across the way this woman was like roofing stuff, putting roofs up.

240
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,820
 She owned her own roofing company.

241
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,060
 And they're checking each other out and the girl's like I'm the married woman but I'm

242
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,540
 not gay and the roofer's like come here beautiful.

243
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,540
 Making out there.

244
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,740
 I'm watching it.

245
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,300
 And I kept expecting one of them to go crazy and start murdering.

246
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,900
 I mean you had a bunch of hammers laying around and saws and stuff.

247
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,980
 No, it was a lesbian love drama.

248
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,220
 About 45 minutes in when they went on a date to Coney Island and they were hugging as the

249
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,740
 sun's going down their seagulls.

250
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,100
 I was like I think I don't think this is a horror movie but maybe.

251
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,460
 I gave it another 15 minutes and I was like okay.

252
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,180
 So I went on IMDB and it wasn't a horror movie.

253
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,420
 It was just a movie about two women falling in love.

254
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,380
 So circle back to circle.

255
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,580
 If you can go into the movie with this little information as the characters have it works

256
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,020
 really really well.

257
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,380
 It's a horror movie.

258
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,100
 It's definitely a horror movie.

259
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,820
 It's a sci-fi horror movie.

260
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,460
 Now again one day I recommended this movie.

261
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,940
 I was seeing this girl and I was like hey you should see this movie.

262
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,220
 The circle is what I called it.

263
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,460
 And she's like really I was like yeah you should watch the circle.

264
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,460
 It's really good.

265
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,780
 And I go it's on Netflix and she looked it up and that was a gay love drama.

266
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,820
 And she watched it because she liked me and then later I was like oh did you see circle

267
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,460
 and she was like yeah and I go what did you think it was pretty cool they're all standing

268
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,660
 in the circle and she's like what?

269
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
 What are you talking about?

270
00:13:52,660 --> 00:14:22,660
 And I was like you remember the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

271
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,620
 Let's go on to our last story here.

272
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,500
 This story is dope.

273
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,860
 It's a very very interesting layered story.

274
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,580
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

275
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,340
 So we are headed to Oklahoma the year is 1898.

276
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:41,380
 And we're going to meet a man, a minister named Solomon Hotemeist, 44 years old.

277
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,220
 Very very well respected man in his community.

278
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,140
 Very well respected man in his state.

279
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,260
 He was a politician.

280
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,740
 He was a public servant.

281
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,780
 He was a minister who was mostly noted for his sermons, his oration, skills were bar

282
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
 none.

283
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,980
 Very very well liked kind respected man in his area.

284
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,780
 But what happens in this little town therein is that people start to get sick and die.

285
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,900
 A mysterious illness is sweeping through the town.

286
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,900
 Now whenever an illness hits a town obviously everyone's going to start panicking.

287
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,380
 Is it going to happen to me or more importantly is it going to happen to my children?

288
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,020
 And Solomon's son comes down with this mysterious illness and passes away.

289
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,260
 Now we know today that it was meningitis that hit this town.

290
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,420
 But back then you had scientists and doctors going I don't know what's going on.

291
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,700
 But it's most likely some sort of biological or contagion, some sort of viral contagion.

292
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,820
 We have to figure out a way to stop this.

293
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,460
 But the people in town go, it's witchcraft.

294
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,580
 Now this whole area was Native American.

295
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,220
 It was very, it was, we're long after Trail of Tears.

296
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
 People are more settled down.

297
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,420
 It wasn't a bunch of wigwams and teepees and stuff like that.

298
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,300
 But they were still mostly Native American in this area.

299
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,420
 So they're going with, it's probably witches.

300
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,940
 It's probably witches and Solomon's like grieving over his son and reading the Bible

301
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,460
 and praying.

302
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,700
 And he goes, you know what, let's get Sam Tamatubby, which is a great name for a Pokemon,

303
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,140
 Tamatubby.

304
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,780
 And it's spelled exactly like you think it is.

305
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,300
 Let's get Sam Tamatubby.

306
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,500
 Very well respected medicine man in the area.

307
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 Let's bring him out.

308
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,980
 And Sam Tamatubby comes out to this church meeting and he goes, yeah, yeah they're witches.

309
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,340
 Like I knew they were witches.

310
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,740
 I've been practicing my medicine man stuff.

311
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,500
 But yeah, I know they're witches.

312
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,140
 So we got to do something about them.

313
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,780
 Solomon goes, the best thing I can do is I will pray and to give these sermons to turn

314
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,300
 people away from witchcraft because we need to stop it now.

315
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,660
 And so he starts delivering all these fiery sermons about the evils of witchcraft and

316
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
 stuff like that.

317
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,580
 But the disease isn't going away.

318
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,260
 And Tamatubby says, the witches are actually using their power to make your sermons not

319
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,500
 work.

320
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,940
 Like we're coming up to a divide here.

321
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,620
 As long as these witches exist in this community, your sermons will be ineffective.

322
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,740
 Solomon is praying day and night.

323
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,700
 Again, just wearing that cloak of the grief of his lost son.

324
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,820
 And you know, other people are still dying in the area.

325
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:29,060
 And then one night when he's praying, he looks out his window.

326
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,300
 Fireball goes streaking through the night sky.

327
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:43,100
 And he gets up and he looks out into the darkness and sees these fireballs flying across the

328
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,700
 planes.

329
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,860
 Now other people were seeing these things too.

330
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,860
 And they weren't shooting stars.

331
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,500
 Because these guys aren't idiots.

332
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,220
 This dude's a college educated dude.

333
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,220
 We're in that era where people aren't like, "Durr, what's that in the sky?

334
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,340
 They know it's the sun."

335
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,460
 Like meningitis is a bit different.

336
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,620
 That's like a viral contagion.

337
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,340
 But it's not like he looked up and saw shooting stars and was like, "Oh, witches."

338
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,020
 They were seeing some weird phenomenon in the area.

339
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
 I'm not saying they were witches.

340
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,140
 It could have been like swamp gas or whatever.

341
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,220
 But people in the area were seeing this thing.

342
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,820
 April 14th, 1898.

343
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,100
 Solomon goes outside his house.

344
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,340
 Knocks on his neighbor door.

345
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
 Knock, knock, knock.

346
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,540
 Sam, we gotta do the Lord's work.

347
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,780
 Walk to his other neighbor's house.

348
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,220
 Knock, knock, knock.

349
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,340
 Tobias, old timey name.

350
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,180
 Tobias, get your gun.

351
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:45,220
 Solomon and Sam in Tobias hop in his car and they drive to his sister-in-law's house,

352
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,860
 Vena Coleman, who he believes is one of these witches.

353
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,460
 So Solomon Hotema and his two neighbors show up at Vena's house, jump out of the car.

354
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,100
 Both neighbors have rifles.

355
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,300
 Solomon has a shotgun and they see Vena and they go, "This is our first witch."

356
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,420
 Here's a quote from Vena's daughter who was there during this whole scenario.

357
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,820
 "Mr. Hotema, he keepin' comin' nearer to our house and he pointed his gun our way as

358
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,940
 he raised it to the shoulder.

359
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,860
 I run into the house and my mama pushed baby toward floor.

360
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,260
 He missed them once, I think.

361
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,260
 And mama grabbed baby and tried to run from him.

362
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,380
 I don't know just what happened next.

363
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,260
 But when shooting stopped, I looked outside the house.

364
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,500
 Mr. Hotema, he was gone but mama was layin' on ground near gate.

365
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,180
 She did not make no noise but little baby was cryin'.

366
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,700
 Mama was layin' on it, one shoulder, holdin' baby to ground.

367
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,780
 I told my brother who was in the house, "Mr. Hotema, he killed mama.

368
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,980
 We must run."

369
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,420
 And we run away.

370
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,940
 I don't think I ever saw mama again.

371
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,100
 I don't never hate Mr. Hotema.

372
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,620
 He was good man.

373
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,420
 He was our pastor.

374
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,420
 But I don't think my mama was a witch."

375
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,060
 So they leave.

376
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,100
 They hop in their car but that's only the first witch they have to kill.

377
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,860
 So it is going to be a long day for this small community.

378
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,300
 They start driving, they go to Whole Greenwood's house.

379
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,020
 This would be one of those things that's terrifying.

380
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,540
 It's Whole Greenwood's house.

381
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,100
 They pull up, jump out of their car.

382
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 So they walk into the house.

383
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
 Oh, they kick down the door.

384
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
 Basically they don't knock on, "Hey, how are you doing?

385
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
 Hey, can I see your wife?"

386
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,620
 They come in the house and they go, "Where's your wife?"

387
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,820
 And Whole goes, "Uh, you know, what are you guys doin' here?

388
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,940
 You guys got these guns and stuff like that."

389
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,700
 They say, "Listen, you can tell us where your wife is or we're gonna kill you."

390
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,180
 And at that point the wife comes out and she goes, "I'm right here, I'm right here."

391
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,580
 And they go, "Okay, we're gonna kill you."

392
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,260
 And now everyone's freaking out and she's begging for her life.

393
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,420
 Sorry, this is a dark one.

394
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,100
 She's begging for her life.

395
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,020
 The husband's trying to get involved and they say, "If you move, we're going to kill

396
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,900
 you too."

397
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,580
 But she's definitely dead.

398
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,300
 And as she's begging for her life, they execute her.

399
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,660
 Now that would be a heartbreaking place to be in and you could say, "Well, you should've

400
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,820
 like done like a John Wick kick and knocked all the gun."

401
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,580
 You know, it's easy to go through that stuff now, but they leave and he's there with his

402
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,740
 dead wife.

403
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,060
 At this point, word has gotten out.

404
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,820
 Solomon and his neighbors are executing witches.

405
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,740
 It's an interesting time period because it's 1898, people aren't idiots.

406
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,140
 A lot of people are like, "That's probably a sickness.

407
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,420
 Like yes, it could be witchcraft and stuff like that, but him and his congregation believed

408
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,420
 in the witches?"

409
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,820
 But you had other people in town who were like, "That's lunacy that people are believing

410
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,820
 in."

411
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,220
 So when someone's driving around and killing witches, you're assuming that they're gonna

412
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,860
 think you're a witch because you don't believe in witches.

413
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,820
 People are hiding, people are trying to contact the authorities and say there's basically a

414
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,900
 mass shooting going on.

415
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:02,140
 The killers, Solomon and his crew, go to Amos Morris' house and he's just sitting there

416
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,700
 and they just walk up and kill him.

417
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,420
 There's no discussion at all.

418
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,380
 There's no time for him to plead for his life.

419
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,260
 They simply just execute him right there.

420
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,300
 They got one more target to go to and that's Eastman, Mississippi.

421
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
 Eastman, Mississippi.

422
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,620
 They drive out to his house, knock, knock, knock.

423
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,460
 No answer.

424
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,260
 Open the spooky door.

425
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,540
 Look around each room.

426
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,900
 Just wasn't home that day.

427
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,220
 Redu's looking to blow his brains out all over.

428
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,380
 He just wasn't home.

429
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,020
 He wasn't hiding, he just wasn't there.

430
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,580
 So at this point, the authorities have all of these reports of these, you're hearing

431
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
 the gunshots.

432
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,900
 They're driving around looking for these guys.

433
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,780
 Next day, they do find Solomon.

434
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,060
 He's at a train station.

435
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,220
 He's getting ready to go to Texas.

436
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,100
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, I was going to turn myself in.

437
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,580
 I was going to turn myself in."

438
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,260
 But all of that is really just kind of the beginning of the story because what happens

439
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,860
 is we get into the legal ramifications of all this stuff.

440
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,220
 He gets arrested and they go, "Why did you kill them?"

441
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,740
 And his quote, "I have the authority to do so."

442
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,980
 Cop goes, "Where did you get this authority?"

443
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
 And again, another quote.

444
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:17,260
 In the book of all books, the Bible, in the passage wherein it says, "Thou shalt not suffer

445
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,780
 a witch to live."

446
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,580
 He begins writing these letters in jail saying, "Listen, I know I killed a bunch of witches,

447
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,420
 but they're witches, and I am going to be a martyr for this cause of humans versus witches."

448
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,660
 Let me actually read you this quote.

449
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,980
 I thought it was interesting.

450
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,740
 This is from one of his letters.

451
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:42,140
 "Since 1898, an opposition to the work (meaning religion, Christianity specifically) since

452
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,300
 1898, an opposition to the work has been manifested, threatened to wipe us out of existence with

453
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,860
 malpractice, and threats have been repeated on Thursday night, April 13th, 1899, which

454
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,180
 was the day before the shooting started."

455
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,980
 And that's when he saw the fireballs.

456
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,900
 The people who were afraid of them had been dodging for about a week and saw them in their

457
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
 fires.

458
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,540
 They appeared and took it upon myself to sacrifice my life for the Lord's cause and for the

459
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,740
 love of the people.

460
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:20,100
 Now I am numbered with the lawbreakers, only awaiting for trial, not only for trial, but

461
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,060
 humbly to submit my neck to the gallows.

462
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:31,180
 I ask all the Christian people of the land to remember me and my dear wife, Nantz Hotema,

463
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,460
 and my loving little daughter Cornelia, and my darling little son, Frank Hotema, for their

464
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,140
 consolation and denying themselves for Christ so that we may meet each other in heaven where

465
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,260
 there is not parting.

466
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,700
 Yours in Christ, S.E. Hotema."

467
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:56,860
 Tell me that doesn't sound just like the Christ Church Shooters Manifesto, or really any of

468
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:24,100
 these people.

469
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,740
 This was a huge court case because really it came down to this.

470
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,340
 Was he insane when he committed the acts?

471
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,780
 And it wasn't, obviously he was sane enough to go get back up and have everyone, "Oh

472
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,540
 and they were charged as accomplices.

473
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,700
 His two neighbors were charged with accomplices."

474
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,040
 And Tamatubbi was charged with accessory before the fact because they felt like his, him talking,

475
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,860
 he kind of provoked Solomon to do this.

476
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,660
 So there's basically three people arrested over this thing.

477
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,060
 It wasn't, it was he insane to commit acts.

478
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,700
 That was part of it obviously, but is it insane to believe in witches?

479
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,460
 Was actually a big defense during the trial.

480
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,020
 Very, very fascinating because we think of old timey people as being kind of stupid,

481
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:10,500
 but during the trial his defense lawyers was like, "It's stupid to believe in witches

482
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 and you have to shoot them."

483
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,940
 And everyone's like, "That is pretty dumb."

484
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,380
 Like we always think of people in the past as being stupid and superstitious and they

485
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,820
 were in certain things.

486
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,580
 But by 1898 America, the mass population of people didn't believe in witches and that

487
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,980
 actually came up.

488
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,580
 This went to the Supreme Court just whether or not he was sane.

489
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,500
 They had all these trials and when it went to the Supreme Court they said, "Listen, we

490
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,620
 used to believe in witches."

491
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,420
 Like we executed people in America a couple hundred years ago and it was so shameful, but

492
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,060
 we did it.

493
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,260
 Maybe the natives, maybe the Indians haven't caught up to us yet.

494
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,380
 So that was an interesting little side of racist thing.

495
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,660
 They're saying, "We did it and we know now it was wrong."

496
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,540
 And the Indian society hasn't caught up to the West yet.

497
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,860
 So maybe they're just dumb.

498
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,660
 Maybe it's not necessarily insane but they're not really thinking things through.

499
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,500
 It's funny to think the Supreme Court could come out with a ruling like that.

500
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,260
 But anyways, then some weird stuff happened.

501
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,700
 After they're all arrested, this is before all the trial stuff, but while they're arrested

502
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,620
 Tobias will, I'm grouping this up for a specific reason.

503
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,540
 After they're all arrested they're all sitting in jail.

504
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:27,300
 Tobias Williams, one of the dudes with the gun, jailers go to a cell, he's dead.

505
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,300
 What?

506
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,780
 Hang himself?

507
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
 No.

508
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,780
 Heart attack?

509
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,280
 No.

510
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,260
 Nobody knows how this dude died.

511
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,820
 Just died in a cell.

512
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,340
 The other two bailed out.

513
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,140
 Tamatubby, Sam Fry bailed out.

514
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,180
 I believe actually that Solomon was bailed out as well.

515
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,460
 A waiting trial.

516
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,740
 But Tamatubby, after he gets out of jail, a waiting trial, he's standing by a giant

517
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,980
 bonfire, right?

518
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,500
 Just hanging out.

519
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,980
 He gets paralyzed and he falls into the fire, getting horribly burned.

520
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,940
 He survives.

521
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,100
 But he basically had a stroke in one of the worst places you can have.

522
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,740
 The worst place you can have a stroke is probably swimming, but the second worst would be near

523
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
 a fire.

524
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,380
 So he survives, but he just became paralyzed for a moment, fell into the fire.

525
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,540
 Solomon's nephew was going to be a witness for the trial.

526
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,380
 He had nothing to do with the shooting spree, but he must have had something to do with

527
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,100
 before or after it.

528
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,060
 But before the trial starts, maybe like, I don't know, what was it, two 300 yards away

529
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,540
 from the church that Solomon preached at?

530
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:47,220
 They found his nephew dead, bullet wound, rifle on the ground.

531
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,500
 And people could never figure out, did he kill himself?

532
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,700
 Someone shoot him?

533
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,020
 Or an accident?

534
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,980
 We don't know what happened to Fry really after this.

535
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,420
 The reason why I grouped all those things is those seem a little bit like curses, don't

536
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,620
 they?

537
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,820
 Solomon ended up being found guilty.

538
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,860
 The insanity plea did not work, and they very rarely do.

539
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,020
 They work like 1% of the time.

540
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
 He was found guilty.

541
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,860
 He was sentenced to death.

542
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,660
 It was then commuted to life.

543
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,780
 They said, we're not going to execute him.

544
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:22,660
 And then around '54, '55, he was trying to get out of jail and just be under house arrest

545
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,540
 because he was so old, kind of frail, but he ended up dying in jail.

546
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,140
 That story is known as the Choctaw Witch Killer.

547
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,660
 I should have said Choctaw earlier.

548
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,420
 That was the tribe that all of these people were involved in.

549
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,020
 The Choctaw Witch Killer is how this story is known.

550
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,260
 I was presented in the media.

551
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:47,100
 A man and his two friends whipped up in a religious fervor by a medicine man, travel around a

552
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,820
 community, executing people because they thought they were witches.

553
00:29:52,820 --> 00:30:00,900
 And then most of those men involved suffered their own calamity afterwards, a curse, if

554
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
 you will.

555
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,540
 Were there really witches in that town?

556
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,900
 Probably not.

557
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,620
 Do witches exist?

558
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,140
 There are people who openly proclaimed to be witches nowadays.

559
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,980
 They would be offended if you said that they don't exist and it's all made up.

560
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,100
 There's two questions I have about this story, really.

561
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,780
 One, why did they zero in on those particular people to be witches?

562
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,580
 I think that detail has been lost to time.

563
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:33,460
 And two, while I'm not supporting the idea of going around and killing witches, the fact

564
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:40,820
 that those bizarre events happened to the defendants afterwards makes me think they

565
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,260
 didn't get all of them.

566
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,980
 There was that one guy who wasn't home.

567
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:55,180
 Was it true that there was a witch in that area who was saved by luck and then used his

568
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,900
 powers to avenge his fallen coven?

569
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
 Fancyful?

570
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
 Yes.

571
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,900
 Bordered line are responsible?

572
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,620
 Yes.

573
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:14,060
 But after the gunfire, after the stories of superstition vs logic, after the last fireball

574
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:21,820
 was seen in the sky, was there still one more dark magic user in that area?

575
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,300
 Casting spells.

576
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,180
 But this time for revenge.

577
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,140
