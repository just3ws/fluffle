1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 What would you do if one day you were hanging out with your best friend and you saw a moose walk by?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Or did you?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we meet a family that's on vacation.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And they start to hear rumors about a local haunted house.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 When this family shows up to this abandoned home, they have no idea they're about to go straight into the depths of the unknown.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the bright sunny world.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is the last of our Christmas livestream.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Contributors, everyone give it up for Leo.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Come on in, Leo, big old lion boy. Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Leo, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. Scratching behind the ears.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Make him smile. I don't know. Can lion smile as Leo actually a lion? Who knows?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But anyways, if you guys can't support the Patreon, if you don't want to get scratched behind the ears, that's fine too.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out so much.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Tell your friends, tell your family. Tell everyone you know.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Because that helps the show grow. I like the little rhyming thing. It's pretty fun.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Leo, you're going to be, oh I already said that part.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Leo, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. Why us all the way out to Sweden?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 [Durgible sounds]

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Leo, go ahead and land this Durgible in Sweden.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're about to go on a little trip with two teenage boys.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Now, this story was posted online by somebody going by the name of Zelvin.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We're going to go ahead and call him Miles. And then his friend is also in the story.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We're going to call him Scott. And we're in the country of Sweden.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And Miles explains, I used to live in this house that was near the woods.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And it was also near this long dirt road.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 This really, really long dirt road that had big open fields on both sides of the road.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So me and Scott, we used to take my quad bike and we would drive up and down the road.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 It was just a lot of fun. Being teens, kicking up dust, literally, on the quad bike.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But on one particular day, something weird happened.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I have no way to explain what happened. Just...

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Let me tell you this story. So, Miles says, I was on my quad bike with my buddy Scott.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And we were driving down this dirt road like we had done dozens of times before.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And way off in the distance, we see a figure moving down the road, walking towards us.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And it was a man who appeared to be walking several dogs at once.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 You know how, like, if someone's holding a bunch of leashes and the dogs are pulling them in every which direction,

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 he's like, "I don't know. Go this way, go this way."

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 That's what we saw out there. That's what we saw. We saw a man walking several dogs at once.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Which is unusual, right? Normally people might walk two dogs at the same time.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 This guy straight up looked like he was trying to control 101 Dalmatians.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's far off we see this man trying to control the motion of all these dogs.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And just out of curiosity, we don't really see a lot of people just walking in this area.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Especially not with a bunch of dogs.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Maybe they'll tangle them up with their leashes and it'll fall down and it'll be funny.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Miles fires up the quad bike and they begin driving out towards this man.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But as they get closer, Scott's like, "Miles, Miles, look."

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And Miles looks up and it's no longer a man walking several dogs.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 What they see is a moose.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 That's not the end of the story. I don't know why it took such a long pause.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 They see a moose where the man used to be standing.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 It's not like there was a moose behind this guy. It's why he's walking the dog so fast.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 He's like, "I've been trying to lose this moose for miles. He's following us."

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 No, they no longer see the man walking several dogs.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Now they just see a giant moose and it's walking towards them like the man was.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And they stop the quad bike and they look and they're just watching this moose walk down the road.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 But as the duo is staring at this moose, all of a sudden Miles realizes,

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 "Wait, that's not a moose?"

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You're like, "Damn, these kids just have really bad vision."

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Now Miles goes, "That's not a moose. Look, Scott, look." And they realize that it isn't a moose.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 It's a man walking down the street.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But this time there are no dogs. He's not being pulled every which way.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's just a dude walking down the street.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 At this point your curiosity would be peaked.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Right? Something's going on.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Probably that you have bad vision.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Or it could be something paranormal.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It could be that famous cryptid you heard of.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Man with dogs/moose cryptid. They're still trying to figure out a good name for it.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 The moose walker.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 But anyways, they see now it's a man with no dogs walking down the street.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So Miles and Scott continue to drive towards him.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And that's when they realize the man isn't just walking in a straight line anymore.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He's actually veering from side to side across the road.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He's walking from like...

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Well, not even... They say he's not even really walking.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 He's like stumbling to one side of the road.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And then stumbling to the other side of the road.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And then stumbling to the other...

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And he's still making his way towards the teens.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But they go, "Looks like he was seriously drunk or seriously ill."

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 The way he was stumbling from one side of the road to the other.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And then when they see that, they actually speed up on the quad bike.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Because they think something's wrong.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 They've heard about that medical mystery where people turn into moose is...

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Mies?

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And then stumble around.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They begin driving the quad bike even quicker to see if this guy needs help.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Because he seems like he's in distress the way he's veering from side to side.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 But then they see him actually stumble off the road and into the field.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Remember, there's fields on both sides of this road.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He stumbles off the road.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And now they're like, "Okay, this guy's definitely having some sort of medical emergency.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Let's get out there."

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And so they rev up...

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 [imitates quad bike sound]

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 The quad bike.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And they get to where they saw the man stumble off the road.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And they hop off the ATV and Miles and Scott are like, "Dude, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?"

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Huh?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Where they saw the man fall off the road into the field, there's nobody there.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So the kids are kind of looking around and they're like, "We're not hallucinating.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 This is in the middle of the day. We're not hallucinating. We're not on any drugs.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Forget the fact that a bunch of dogs disappeared. Forget the fact that we saw a moose.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That must have just been like a trick of the light.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 We clearly saw a man and we clearly saw him fall off the road right here.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But where is he? And they looked around and they couldn't find the guy.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And now they're starting to get freaked out.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I would have been freaked out by the moose part.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 But now they're starting to get freaked out and they continue their search for about a minute or two

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 because they swear they saw...

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Even if it was a moose or a man with a bunch of dogs, whatever it was,

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 they saw it fall off into the field, but now there's nothing here in about a minute or two past.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And all of a sudden, Miles and Scott hear a...

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 They hear the crack of a gunshot nearby and then a loud moan echoed across the fields.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 This whale sounded to them like an animal in pain.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 [Miles moans]

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And at that point, you gotta just get out there right at the very least someone's shooting near you.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 You've seen a bunch of weird stuff, you're hearing a weird noise.

123
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And Miles said, "Listen, in this area we do hear gunshots. There are hunters and everything like that.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But we are hearing this animal moaning. We don't see any animals around.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 We've had this huge, like, shared hallucination.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Let's just go home. Quad bike fun has ended for the day.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But it wasn't going to end forever. It was just too fun riding this bike down this dirt road.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 The very next day, Miles and Scott hop back on the quad bike.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They're driving down this dirt road down the road. Once again, far down the road, they see a man walking down the street.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 This time, they speed up right away. They did a lot of starting and stopping and driving slowly the first time.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 They speed up right away. They're driving right out towards this man.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And as they have a clear line of sight on this guy, as they're speeding up, they're looking at him, he turned into a moose.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 They're getting closer and closer, and then he turns back into a human.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 At that point, they begin to see this guy walk from side to side on the road fall off into the field.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 They're getting closer, even closer to where they last saw him fall off into the field when they hear a "pah"

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 After the second time, it played out almost exactly the same.

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 After this second time, it happened on the second day, they never saw it again.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 They never saw whatever this phenomenon was. They never saw it. They never heard it.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It happened two days in a row, and that was it.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And Miles and Scott are kind of left wondering, "What in the world did we just experience?"

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Miles is the one who posted this, and he's thought about it.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Like, was it some sort of event replaying itself out? Was it a...

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Like, what... How would you even explain that? What was going on?

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 It's interesting because I had an encounter like this myself a long time ago.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I'll try to keep it brief. We talked about it on a previous episode, but one day I was sitting outside of an adult learning center.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I was learning how to do, like, video editing at, like, the, you know, adult learning center.

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I don't know another word for it. It wasn't college. It was just like...

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Anyways, I remember I was sitting out there and I was waiting for my mom to pick me up, because I was like 17 years old.

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I wasn't driving at the time. I was waiting for my mom to pick me up, and I'm sitting in this dark parking lot.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And across the way, maybe a good hundred yards, maybe a little bit closer, I see a man being attacked by demons.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I see a man in the dark, and he's like, "Ugh!" And he's getting pulled this way and that way, and he's kind of like stumbling.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And all I see is two black masses next to him, and it seemed like they were pulling him from side to side.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 He's like, "Ugh!" He wasn't actually moaning, okay?

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I'm adding that, because you can't see what I'm doing with my body. I'm pretending I'm getting pulled from side to side.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And I'm sitting there in the darkness, and I'm watching this man get attacked by two large, dark demons.

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And I'm looking at it for a good, like, I don't know, five minutes.

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I'm noticing no point in this story did I get him to offer help.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I was like, "Oh, well, you know the demons will do that from time to time.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 They'll beat people up in a dark parking lot. Nothing I can do about it."

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 As he's getting closer to me, I'm sitting there on like a garden block, you know, those pot thingy that people put plants in.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I was sitting on one of those. Like, "What, are you a smurf?"

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 No, you know, like the big ones they have outside of buildings.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Planter boxes. Planter boxes. Anyways, I'm watching this guy get attacked by demons, and now he's probably only, I don't know, 50, 40 yards away from me in the dark.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I realize, good thing I didn't go open, and start karate choppin'.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Karate choppin' Adam to save him from those demons.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 He wasn't being assaulted by demons. He was carrying two large vacuum cleaners.

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 He had these giant vacuum cleaners, and he was carrying them.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 It was like 10 or 11 o'clock at night. He's probably a janitor or something.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 He was carrying these giant vacuum cleaners, and I'm watching at that point.

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I was like, "Oh, good thing he wasn't being attacked by demons."

171
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Now I definitely could offer my assistance and say, "Do you need help?"

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 But, you know, better to be safe than sorry. Maybe they're demonically possessed vacuum cleaners.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But, I, people, I'm sure you guys are wondering why I didn't roll them.

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I don't know. I don't know why. I'm sure there was an easier way to carry these things, but for whatever reason.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In the distance in the darkness, I just couldn't see.

176
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 They looked like demons. Those vacuum cleaners looked like demons. That's why.

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Jason, is that why your house is always unclean? Not unclean, but unvacumed.

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Is there a better term for it? You walk through my house, you step on pebbles everywhere. That's not an exaggeration.

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I don't know. I don't vacuum because I'm lazy.

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But anyway, so I get, when I was reading this moose story, I was like, "It doesn't make sense from a distance something can look like one thing."

181
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And then, as it gets closer, it looks like something else.

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 My story is different, obviously. My story is different. It just shows how lazy I am.

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I didn't even help this guy. I was like, "Yeah, yeah, at least you didn't get attacked by demons."

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 He's like, "What? What are you talking about? Can you help me carry these vacuum cleaners?"

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I'm like, "Nope. I don't do that."

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 To see someone walking to a bunch of dogs and as they get closer, you see they're a moose.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I can kind of get that part of it. What makes it interesting, well, the whole story is interesting,

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 but what makes it interesting is that it replayed itself out twice, and then the guy fell off

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 and he disappeared and the gunshot and the wounded animal and all that stuff.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Had I gone back to that adult learning center the next night and I saw the same thing happen,

191
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 then I would assume that this janitor's soul may be trapped in the Valley of the Damned.

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 He is forever to carry two vacuum cleaners across the parking lot. That's his ultimate hell.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 He's like, "No." Then I would assume there's something paranormal about it.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 If I saw him or he just needed four vacuum cleaners and he carried two in the first 90s,

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 he's like, "Oh, I'll get the next two tomorrow." But I would be like, "No, it's paranormal."

196
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 If you saw it play out again, obviously, if I went to go use one of his vacuum cleaners

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 and they weren't there, then that would be paranormal.

198
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I don't know. I could just stop focusing on my story, which has been thoroughly debunked

199
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 and focus back on this story.

200
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 My read on the story of Miles and Scott was, yeah, it was some sort of recording.

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I almost feel like, I mean, there's a couple different ways you could put it out.

202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Maybe it was almost like a one-man play of a recording.

203
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 The guy with the dogs was him actually hunting the moose in the first place.

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 This story could have taken place 100 years ago.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 The man with the dog is hunting the moose and then the moose manifests,

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 and then you have the man kind of stumbling around.

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's such an abstract haunting, which is what you would expect from the Europeans.

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 You just have this weird visual, and then the gun and the animal, the gun-shot,

209
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 and then the animal moaning, it does seem like it's some event that is playing out.

210
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But why did it play out two days in a row and then never again or before?

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Again, it's most likely what we would consider a residual haunting.

212
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It's this act that you can't interact with.

213
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 If they ever got to the guy, if they did see him again, they wouldn't be able to communicate with him.

214
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's just this thing that goes on over and over again.

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Very fascinating. I love the fact that, and again, it's like broad daylight when they're seeing this thing.

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And it happens twice in a row.

217
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 What is it? Is the man the moose? Is it some sort of shape-shifter?

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Who knows? It's absolutely an insane story.

219
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I honestly wish I had more answers for you, but on the other hand, I kind of like the fact that we don't.

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Actually, no, I would have preferred to have more answers on this one just because it is so weird.

221
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But yeah, was it a shape-shifter? Did a man accidentally shoot a shape-shifter?

222
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Did a man accidentally shoot a human that he must have for a moose?

223
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And that's what he was seeing.

224
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And then when he shot the guy, he made a moose sound when he died. Who knows?

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Absolutely fascinating, very abstract ghost story coming out of Sweden.

226
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Leo, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the carbonar copter.

227
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 We are leaving behind this field. We're waving goodbye to that moose.

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 We wish him the best. Fly us all the way out to a haunted house.

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 [hawking]

230
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 We're landing outside of this haunted house. This is one of those stories where we don't have an exact location.

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 It was posted online by someone using the handle "Successful Effect 89".

232
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 We're going to go ahead and call them Phil.

233
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So Phil said back in 2003, him, his parents, and three uncles were on vacation together.

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They were traveling through the area, enjoying the sights and the sounds, eating at local diners, the works.

235
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And while they're hanging out in this town, they hear a rumor about a haunted house in the area.

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And who's going to pass that up?

237
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Who's going to pass up the fact that you're sitting at some diner and the waitress is like, "What'll it be, honey?"

238
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And you're like, "I'll take the pancakes and this guy here will have the burger and whatever."

239
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And they can figure it out. They can figure it out.

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And the waitress is like, "Well, tell you what, burgers, huh? That reminds me of a haunted house in the area."

241
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And they're like, "What haunted house?"

242
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And she goes, "Yeah, honey, apparently there's a house on the edge of town that's been abandoned for years."

243
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Local legends. This is not what you want to hear before you're eating your hamburger.

244
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The legend says that a madman went even crazier than normal and hacked an entire family to death.

245
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Chopped them up good?

246
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 They do find out about this haunted house in the area.

247
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And they decide to check it out.

248
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's vacation, right? That'd be dope. I would do it.

249
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So they drive out to the outskirts of town.

250
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And when we got there, what we see is there's this two-story home that's sitting on a large piece of land,

251
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 but the entire place is just falling apart.

252
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Like, if any place was going to be a haunted house, it would be something like this.

253
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It seems almost like the place that a bunch of, like, druggies and teenagers would go to on the weekends

254
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 and smoke and drink and all that stuff.

255
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 There was graffiti all over the building.

256
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 No one would ever bother you out here.

257
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 This seems like the type of place that if it's not a haunted house, like a genuine haunted house,

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 it would have some cool stuff to see walking around.

259
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And so Phil said they all get out of the car and they're walking in, and he goes like it would seem with their abandoned house.

260
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 He goes, it was a complete mess.

261
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 He goes, some of the rooms were missing more than one wall.

262
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Just the place is completely falling apart.

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You could see where nature was taking back the land.

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 It was creeping through the floorboards.

265
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 It was destroying the structure of this house.

266
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 There was no ceiling on the second floor, which technically means there's just no ceiling, right?

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 There's no ceiling on the second floor.

268
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He said you would find the graffiti and someone unspray painted on the wall.

269
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 This is the house of the devil.

270
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But, you know, you'd expect that's what teenagers would be spray painting.

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 They continued to explore the house.

272
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 They're just kind of walking around the ground floor.

273
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And Phil says he sees a doorway.

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And when he goes, they're in the house.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 They're here during the daytime.

276
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 They're not a bunch of teenagers.

277
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 They're not going to hit this place up late at night.

278
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 They're actually exploring it during the day.

279
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And Phil said even during the day he goes, when I looked into this doorway, the room was exceptionally dark.

280
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And what he saw was a spiral staircase.

281
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So you had the door leading into what he presumes is the basement at this point.

282
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And he says you have this doorway and then you have this spiral staircase leading down into the darkness.

283
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And it's impenetrable darkness.

284
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Like they cannot see what's down there.

285
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And they figure, like Phil, that this must be the basement.

286
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And because it was the creepiest room they had found so far, because they were also saying it seemed a little underwhelming.

287
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 What they were walking through was just kind of a junk house.

288
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 They were hoping for something a little more spooky.

289
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 But when Phil spied this basement, the group, this guy is walking around with his three uncles and two parents.

290
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He's the only kid there.

291
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 They go, you know what? Let's save that room for last.

292
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Because right now everything's kind of been underwhelming.

293
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So unless we all get attacked by killer hobos on the second floor, that will be the most exciting room.

294
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Let's save it for last.

295
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They do actually, I mean I want to do this, it's completely unsafe, but they do go to the second floor of this crumbling house.

296
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 They walk up the staircase, they are leaving the basement for their way out.

297
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 They check that out at the very end.

298
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 They go up to the second floor, they look around, it's just more of the same.

299
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 It's just floorboards being creaky, no ceiling, graffiti on walls, stuff like that.

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Not super spooky. Interesting, sure.

301
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But not incredibly spooky.

302
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 So then they go, "Oh, you know what? We looked around upstairs, we've done downstairs, it's okay.

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Let's go check out that spooky basement."

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 We truly did save the best for last.

305
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So Phil says they all walk down the stairs back to the ground floor.

306
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And he goes, "We walked to where the basement was, and there's no longer a door there.

307
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It was just a solid wall."

308
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And he's looking at it, and his family's looking at it, and they're standing in the exact same spot they were just a little bit ago.

309
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 They know this is the doorway to the basement, but there's no door there.

310
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It's as if there was never a door there.

311
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 It was just one solid piece of wall.

312
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But what Phil says is even weirder than that, and that's pretty weird.

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Phil says we came downstairs, we looked at this wall where we had just previously seen a doorway leading into the basement.

314
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 The doorway does not exist, it never existed, it's just a wall.

315
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 He goes, "Not only is that extremely weird."

316
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He goes, "None of us, not even me, none of us, thought it was weird."

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 He said that was the weirdest part, was that we didn't freak out that the door wasn't there.

318
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 We just saw that the door wasn't there and go, "Oh, huh.

319
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 That's interesting that there used to be a door here, right? Yeah, okay."

320
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Maybe there's another entrance to the basement.

321
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 That's what they all thought, including Phil.

322
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 They go, "Oh, that's odd, but not impossible. It's not breaking the universe odd."

323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 They all acknowledged it was weird, but none of them were freaked out by it.

324
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 None of them were afraid, none of them were worried or anything.

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 They just accepted it as possible that a door could cease to exist and be replaced with a wall.

326
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It's not like they were in the wrong spot, it's not like they forgot about the basement, it's none of that.

327
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 They were clearly acknowledging something had happened which is impossible and none of them cared that they were looking at the impossible.

328
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 In fact, they just said, "Let's look for another entrance to the basement."

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah, I bet you that would work.

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 This impossible thing happened in front of us.

331
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 That's fine. Let's look for another entrance. They were so blasé about it.

332
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 All of them, including Phil.

333
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Phil said we continued to look around on the ground floor a bit because we wanted to go check out the basement,

334
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 but we could find no other entrances down there.

335
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 So we all just kind of go, "Oh, well."

336
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And left.

337
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And it wasn't until later.

338
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It wasn't until way after the fact when Phil was thinking about it and he goes, "What in the world happened?"

339
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 We clearly saw the impossible take place.

340
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We all acknowledged there used to be a door there.

341
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And now there was a wall. The door never existed.

342
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 We all acknowledged that part was true.

343
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 We all acknowledged there was a basement because we were looking for another way to get into it.

344
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But none of us acknowledged how absolutely mind-bending it would have to be for a doorway to cease to exist.

345
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 We acknowledged it had happened, but we weren't scared or terrified or shocked or confused.

346
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It was just something that happens.

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 They left the haunted house and they never explored the basement.

348
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 It's an interesting story you think.

349
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 We're talking about, we do this a lot on the show because we cover a lot of paranormal activity.

350
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 The power that this house would have to warp, that's almost beyond a paranormal.

351
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 There's no ghost story that I can think of where a ghost can manipulate a human mind like that,

352
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 can show them something impossible, but then make them not care or not be worried about it.

353
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 That is, I mean, even I'm trying to think of a demon story that's like that.

354
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Demons love to revel in terror.

355
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 So they would want you to be confused and shocked and terrified in the moment.

356
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 This type of power level almost borders on alien, which in the alien world we see a lot of mind erasers,

357
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 we see a lot of lost time, we see a lot of mental tricks with alien tech and alien civilizations.

358
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So, I mean, we do have UFO stories of people looking at a UFO land and the people are like,

359
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 "Yeah, it was super weird. I wasn't worried about it at all.

360
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I wasn't worried about this ship and land that these people are getting off.

361
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 When I look back on it, it's quite terrifying, but at the time I was just kind of watching it.

362
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 That's kind of common in UFO stories, but in a haunted house in the outskirts of town,

363
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 that's quite powerful, not just to make the door disappear.

364
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 That takes one level of power. You're basically altering reality,

365
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 but to then make the people... Because again, think about how you would feel if you went into the bathroom

366
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 and then you came out and your house had no front door.

367
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Like, it just didn't exist. And it's not that you don't remember it existing or it's in a different place.

368
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 You clearly know it was there and then you come out.

369
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 There would be a level of shock and it would really mess with your head.

370
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 But imagine if you saw that and go, "Oh, my front door's gone."

371
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And then you continue to watch two and a half men.

372
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Right? I mean, there's a big difference between the two.

373
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And so it's interesting because I was reading the story.

374
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I don't think I said this either, but this story took place back in 2003.

375
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So there is a bit of a time period for it.

376
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And while we don't have a specific location, Phil said,

377
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "What's interesting too is the more I thought about it, this location of the country we were in,

378
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 the houses generally don't have basements."

379
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 So that was like, that wasn't something I was thinking about at the time.

380
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 I was like, "Oh, wait. How's the basement? Forget the vanishing door. That's the odd detail."

381
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 No, he goes, "I thought about it." He goes, "We assumed it was the basement."

382
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Because it was a staircase leading underground, but houses in this part of the country don't normally have basements.

383
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So who knows what it was?

384
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 When I was reading the story, I was reading it as like, you know, reality, altering, location, some sort of bizarre, demonic activity.

385
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Was this a place of where people were sacrificed? Is this a place of just hardcore, dark energy?

386
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I was thinking of all this stuff on kind of like a macrocosm.

387
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Looking at the story and kind of trying to think of how it relates to other paranormal stories and things like that.

388
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And it's funny because I read this post by Phil a couple of times.

389
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And it wasn't until the very last time that I read, I really read the last sentence.

390
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I don't know why I... It didn't exist. It didn't exist every other time I read this.

391
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I was looking at this from the level of like a paranormal researcher and looking at how this activity correlates to other stuff we know.

392
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And when you do that, a lot of times you do miss the human details.

393
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Because Phil's had 20 years to think about this story.

394
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And this is something that I didn't think of. You guys, it might have popped in your head, but I didn't think of it when I was reading the story over and over again.

395
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But to Phil, he was right there. He was right on the precipice of going into this basement.

396
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Like, who knows where this led? And then he went upstairs and he came back and there was no entrance to this void.

397
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And the door no longer existed.

398
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 So he finished off his post like this. I hadn't even occurred to me that this could have been possible.

399
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 But to Phil and his family, Phil ends his post by saying that he still thinks about this event to this day.

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 It's been 20 years and he still thinks about the door disappearing.

401
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But more chillingly, he thinks, what if me and my parents and my three uncles had walked down those stairs, all of us together,

402
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 walked into that basement to check out the scariest room in the house.

403
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And then the door disappeared.

404
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Had we not checked out the second floor first, had we walked through that passageway when we found it,

405
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 what would have happened to them?

406
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 With no door, there'd be no hope of escape.

407
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Had they walked through that door the second they saw it, would they have ever seen daylight again?
