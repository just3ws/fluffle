1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 A minister has a bizarre way to pass on God's blessings.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,360
 If you were driving down the road and saw a sexy woman,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:16,320
 would you try to hug her? That's the whole story. And then we take a look at the story of the faceless.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,000
 Is there any truth to an old Native American legend about a man who was so vain he lost his face?

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,520
 And does it have terrifying implications for us all today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:42,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
 Garvin or I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,400
 an awesome weekend this whole week. I'm gonna tell you the most depressing, dark stories. No,

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,720
 just kidding. Just kidding. Last week we did cursed episodes. I hope you guys are still around. I'll

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,920
 check my download numbers to see how many of you guys got possessed by demons and are now listening

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
 to other podcasts of it. That's what the demons want. You have to listen to my podcast. No,

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,680
 I've decided to take a bit of a break from the super depressing stuff. Thanks for indulging me

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,680
 last week. Speaking of indulging me, weird segue, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, pushing in a

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,000
 giant hot fudge sundae that we're all gonna eat, it's Mikey Radmaker. Mikey Radmaker. He's making a

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,280
 rad sundae for us right now. He has on an old soda jerk costume. He's like, "Hey everyone,

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,520
 he's scooping us out ice cream." Mikey, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode,

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
 and apparently also the first new service as food. You guys can't support the Patreon or if you're

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,840
 lactose intolerant, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,920
 helps out a lot. Mikey, oh dude, I'm so hungry for ice cream right now. I'm so hungry for ice cream,

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,800
 but I'm eating it in my imagination. Mikey, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,920
 hair hang glider. We are gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. These hands are all slippery from

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,240
 the ice cream. Oh no! Falling to his and all of our depths because he's our pilot. Mikey, after

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,400
 you wash your hands and dry them, let's get you in the hair hang glider. We're leaving behind Dead

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
 Rabbit Command. We are headed out to South Africa.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:26,160
 Now, I have to say this. I put this call out on my Twitter feed and I put it out on YouTube.

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,840
 Somebody may have recommended this story to me. I'm pretty sure somebody did. I don't remember

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
 who. I keep track of all my correspondence, but I get recommendations through Facebook,

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
 through Gmail, through the Patreon email, through YouTube, through Twitter, through Instagram,

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,280
 and I checked all the stuff. I couldn't find out who sent this to me. So if you recommended

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,240
 this story to me, I will make amends to you. I'll be able to prove as well. You can't just

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,880
 say that you did it. I'll be able to go through my documents, but I'm pretty sure someone recommended

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,000
 this story to me. I don't think I would have stumbled across this one, but you recommended

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
 this story to me. We'll make amends, so don't worry. I'll take care of you, but I couldn't wait on it

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,240
 anymore because when I started asking people, "Hey, does anyone know who recommended this?" Everyone's

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,080
 like, "No, just tell me the story that sounds super interesting." We're in Guiani. That's in the state

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:20,720
 of Limpopo in South Africa. So the hair hang rider expertly piloted by Mikey lands us in Guiani.

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,360
 We're actually landing right in front of sevenfold Holy Spirit ministries. It's a church and the

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,520
 doors open up. We walk and we see all these parishioners sitting there and they're like,

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,880
 "Hallelujah, singing the songs, singing the songs of praise." It's like this whole musical number.

40
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,480
 They're all choreographed. They have this special thing going on. Mikey knows all the dance moves.

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 We're like, "What? We didn't know you were part of the story." But that's not the whole dance move,

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
 whole choreographed dancer team. That's not why we're here, as entertaining as it is.

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,120
 In the very front of the church, we see a man laying on his back and everyone's like,

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
 "Give me the praise. Give me the praise. Give me the praise. Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot."

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,400
 And we see, walk out onto stage, whatever that part of the church is called. It's not like I was

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,800
 raising the church or anything. We meet Pastor Christ Penelope and he's like, "Doot, doot." He's

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,200
 like, "Shitting fireworks out of his fingertips." And there's a man just laying there on the ground

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,080
 and Pastor Christ Penelope is kind of doing a little dance. I don't know. I don't know.

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,480
 I don't know why I've turned it into that Steve Martin movie, a leap of faith. I don't know why

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,120
 I turned it into like a revival movement. It could just be super solemn. The point is,

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
 is that Pastor Christ Penelope, I don't know why I'm trying to make it so exciting. The story

52
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,200
 itself is so bizarre. It doesn't need all this razzmatazz. There's a guy laying on his back

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,000
 at the very front of the church and Pastor Christ, everyone's sitting down now. They're all quiet.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,960
 Pastor Christ Penelope comes out and he goes, "I'm going to bless this man. This man is in need.

55
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,880
 This man is in need of some miracles." And Pastor Christ Penelope starts to squat

56
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,080
 and gets down, gets those quads working, gets those thighs working. He sits down and we're like,

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,440
 "What in the world?" And I'm like, "Wait for it. Wait for it." And he keeps getting lower and his butt

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,760
 is getting closer and closer to this dude's head. Specifically, we're actually seeing a lineup. It's

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,960
 almost like we can gauge it from where we're at. The anus of the minister is starting to line up

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 perfectly with the man's mouth. It's like playing one of those crane games and right when he, yep,

61
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,600
 yep, phew, locks in. Now instead of winning like a plush prize, we all of a sudden hear a

62
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,920
 "This is a real story, by the way. This isn't something I made up." He farts right in the dude's

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:55,680
 mouth and everyone's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Everyone's clapping and celebrating the fact.

64
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,360
 This is not a one-off occasion. Pastor Christ Penelope believes that his farts are holy.

65
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,040
 There are photos of this, by the way. I don't have to keep saying that a lot of times.

66
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,280
 There are photos of this. There are photos of Pastor Christ Penelope looking right at the camera.

67
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
 It's not like a candid photo. It's not some weird thing he's doing in the back. He's looking right

68
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
 at the camera. There's a man laying on the floor and he's just sitting on his face. There is a

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,080
 wait period to get farted on. There's so many people who want this that you have to sign a list.

70
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,040
 And if, like, let's say you're sitting like you're like, "Oh, I'm dying. I only have two months to

71
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,440
 live." He's like, "Well, three month waiting list." People who are sick, I think, get to the front

72
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,160
 of the line, but local business leaders, people who are starting their own businesses, people who

73
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,160
 are bidding on contracts, they will have to wait up to two months before this man will fart in their

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,600
 mouth. It has to be this man. I mean, you could probably pay someone on the street to do that.

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,560
 And some people would probably do it for free. But this man, his farts are blessed. They're holy.

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,880
 And some people will bring stuff with them that he can also fart on. There is a division in the

77
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
 church, though, because you have people who love it. They go, "Listen, when he farts on you, you

78
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,200
 don't even smell it. It's like magical." And then the other people go, "I don't care whether or not

79
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,840
 you smell it. It's still gas being expelled, body temperature gas being expelled from the orifice

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,520
 of one man on to me. Whether or not I smell it, it's disgusting. It'd be the same thing if someone

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,680
 just came up and breathed right in my face." And they're like, "But he doesn't have bad breath.

82
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,960
 That doesn't matter. It's still gross." The church is divided. Some people think this is a blessing.

83
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,840
 Other people go, "I think I'm going to have to find another church. You know, I don't have a high

84
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,720
 list of qualifications for my next minister. I only have one question. Do you fart on people?"

85
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,320
 And because of this article, that someone may or may not have recommended me, which is the true

86
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,040
 mystery, really, not whether or not this man's farts are holy. I think we know the answer to that.

87
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:03,680
 They are. But who recommended this story to me? But this story did give me this amazing quote.

88
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,600
 There was a news article for thedailysun.co.za and has the great quote where there was a

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,320
 parishioner being like, "Nope, nope. This is the quote. Quote. That's not what I signed up for.

90
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,200
 I needed prayers, not fart." I don't think in that woman's entire existence she would ever have

91
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,000
 had to say that sentence out loud. I definitely thought that I would never read it, but I love it.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,440
 So funny because in one of the interviews he keeps going, "Go to my Facebook page. Everything is

93
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,600
 explained on my Facebook page. Go to my Facebook page." I went to his Facebook page. It wasn't funny.

94
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:47,200
 I expected it to have a bunch of jokes. I don't know actually why. He has a little green cartoon

95
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
 gas clouds floating around his head. I didn't mean jokes, but I thought it would have more fun

96
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,360
 material. No, it's just about human suffering and people praying and things like that, which I'm

97
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,400
 down with. Not the human suffering thing, but I get the power of prayer. I think that's important,

98
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,040
 the power of mindfulness and connecting to the other and all that stuff. I get that.

99
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,840
 I do have to say this. It's possible, right? Like in a world where Bigfoot and aliens and ghosts

100
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,880
 and all that stuff exist, in a world where the CIA like tests whether or not people can do remote

101
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,240
 viewing and Russia is trying to figure out the secrets of telepathy and the men who stare goats

102
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,200
 and all that stuff, and people having bizarre powers, it's possible out of 7 billion people

103
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,840
 plus more than that through the course of human history, one of us has magical farts.

104
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,400
 Like it's not a long enough timeline. It's going to work. One of us has blessed farts.

105
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:50,800
 It's no more ridiculous than a psychic. If you just look at the plain facts of it,

106
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,480
 it's no more ridiculous than saying I can communicate to your loved ones

107
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,600
 by the rap rap rap on my table. It really isn't. It really isn't. If in the 1860s,

108
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,760
 two sisters in their house realized that they could communicate with the dead through farting,

109
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,400
 back then, and there was a whole spiritualism movement involving farting,

110
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,520
 and now here we are in the year 2021, and this guy in South Africa goes, "Oh, it's so weird. I can

111
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,560
 bless you by asking God, and then I hear a rapping on the table." People would be like, "Well, that's

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,440
 stupid. Everyone knows the paranormal communicates through farts?" So it's- I don't think so. I don't-

113
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,720
 I think this guy just likes farting on people. But to be fair, I could be wrong. He could be a

114
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,960
 mutant. He could be blessed by- not necessarily a mutant, but he could also be divinely blessed by

115
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,280
 God. Who knows? I'm leaning towards neither of those. I'm leaning to him just farting on people.

116
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,120
 Mikey, let's go ahead and hop in the Carpenter Caboose. We're taking a train out of

117
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,760
 Fartsville, South Africa, and that's how it's going to be officially named now.

118
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
 Dude, wouldn't it suck to go to that church and to have built that church with your own bare hands

119
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
 and helped establish that? This dude comes in and starts farting everywhere,

120
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,920
 and that's how it'll be known. Mikey, let's get in the Carpenter Caboose. We are leaving behind

121
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 South Africa. We are headed out to Brazil. Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugg

122
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,240
 saying that Campos Gerais in Brazil chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga

123
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,600
 We're all jumping off the Carpenter Caboose. The year is 1983. We don't have a specific date,

124
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
 which is odd, because we have a bunch of other specific information for this story.

125
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:08,480
 But the year is 1983. It is 830 at night. And we're walking down the street, and we see a man

126
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,680
 named Joaquim Antonio-Louise riding his bike ahead of us.

127
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,640
 He has a little car that has the sound of the car, the little baseball card in the spokes.

128
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,840
 He kind of rounds this curve, and that's when he sees a woman standing on the side of the road.

129
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,320
 830 isn't that late. It's kind of dark depending on what month it is, but it's not.

130
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
 Super late. If you just saw someone standing on the street corner at 830, it wouldn't be

131
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,040
 why is he on the street corner? It's in the middle of nowhere in this rural area. He's a farmer.

132
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,520
 So maybe it would just be weird to see anyone out around that time or in that area.

133
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,560
 But he sees this woman, and he immediately goes Big Bad Wolf from the Looney Tune cartoons.

134
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,200
 His eyeballs are all pretty. He has a medical condition. He was on his way to the hospital.

135
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,280
 He's like, "Oh, I better get these eyeball things checked out." And the fact that I keep making

136
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,440
 sounds like fog horns, I gotta get this checked out. He turns the corner, he sees the girl.

137
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:17,040
 She is thick, as the kids would say these days. She has a voluptuous body, a tight skirt,

138
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,240
 big plump, juicy legs. Really? What podcasts has this become?

139
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,840
 A good one. This podcast says this is a sexy, curvy woman standing by the side of the road

140
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,520
 wearing a short dress and a blouse. And she has a light blue belt tilted slightly to the left.

141
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,320
 So he jumps off the bike and he starts approaching this woman and she's just standing there.

142
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,200
 It's 830 at night. He walks up to her. He feels compelled to go towards her. Now she's a very

143
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,560
 attractive woman. Very, very attractive woman. Sounds attractive, right? Belt tilted to the left.

144
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,600
 That's all I need. That's really all I need. He's walking towards her. He feels compelled.

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 He wants to get to know her. He wants to talk to her. Figure out, you know,

146
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,240
 do I like you? Do you like me? But you guys heard the intro. He just really wants to hug her.

147
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,760
 He doesn't know why, but he really wants to hug her. Total violation of social norms. But

148
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,520
 while Keem's not thinking, he's just drawn towards this woman, he stretches his arms out

149
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,360
 and he goes to wrap them around this plump lady. And then all of a sudden, she jumps away. Now,

150
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,760
 not like she just kind of jumps a couple of feet back and she goes, "Uh-uh-uh." She goes from being

151
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,160
 right in front of him to being 500 meters away, which is actually one-fourth of a mile. That

152
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:56,240
 sounds more dramatic. I don't know how big a meter is. And then she jumped again

153
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,960
 and became a little, a little dot in the sky. Ding. I don't know if it made the animated noise

154
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,560
 and a little sparkle. He actually gets completely terrified by this. He never expected, no one would

155
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,720
 expect this. Woo! She jumps away. He actually got on his bicycle, rode home, and went to sleep.

156
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,960
 I don't know how you would sleep after that. Either way, I'd be afraid she'd come and jump

157
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,560
 on my house for me trying to assault her. That story was reported in the Revista Brasileira de

158
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,920
 UFOologia, which my Portuguese isn't that great, but I'm pretty sure that's the revised Brazilian

159
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,680
 UFOologia book or something like that. I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com. They got it from them.

160
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,600
 It's an interesting story for a couple of reasons. One, we've seen stories where people feel compelled

161
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,840
 to go towards cryptids and aliens. It's almost like a hypnotic thing. They're kind of swayed

162
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,080
 into something. He may have been under some sort of mind control. She could have just been super

163
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,080
 sexy. And he's like, "I want to get to know her." And as he's walking towards her, then he's just

164
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,560
 like, "I'm just going to grab her." Which, don't do that part. Don't do that part, right? Now,

165
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,360
 when you have someone you like, don't just try to hug them on the first meeting. I don't get that.

166
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,080
 I don't get that. I know people like to hug the first time they meet people. That's always weird

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,760
 to me, especially at 8.30 at night. You can do it. It's 7pm. That's fine. But in the middle of nowhere,

168
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,080
 it makes it even weirder. He doesn't know this woman at all. He's just walking up to hug her.

169
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,160
 Story's bizarre. And then her jumping. Actually, that's the most bizarre part. I'm not like, "Oh,

170
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,960
 yeah." And then, by the way, she also did an inhuman feat. So, cryptid alien? I think alien,

171
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:48,400
 because she's had the belts. I mean, a lot of humans wear belts. I'm not saying there's 7

172
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,520
 billion aliens on the planet. But a lot of times, I don't think of many cryptids who have belts on.

173
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,200
 But there's a lot of sexy cryptids, too. So, that's kind of… it's an interesting story. I mean,

174
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:08,720
 it was reported by this UFOology association, but alien? I'm leaning more towards alien than cryptid,

175
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,560
 but still, just a weird story all around. Moral of the story, don't hug people. Never hug. Never

176
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,920
 hug anyone again. Just let your baby lay in the crib and go, "Uh-uh, you might jump away."

177
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,680
 That's the first moral. And I think that's actually the only moral. I don't think there is a moral.

178
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,520
 He goes to hug a woman, she jumps away, he gets on his bike and rides home. Rides out of

179
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,920
 the fields of Campos de Ries, Brazil, and into the hearts and minds of all

180
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,400
 Dead Rabbit radio listeners. And you know who else is a powerful jumper? You know who else is

181
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:52,320
 really good at jumping? Superman. March 18th on HBO Max. Batman and the Flash and Wonder Woman.

182
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,560
 And who's the other guy? Aquaman. Team up. In a world without Superman. Who will prevent

183
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:06,800
 Darkseid from taking over the planet? They will. Watch. Zack Snyder's Justice League. March 18th.

184
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,400
 Only on HBO Max. Rated R. Cross my Superman sound effect. You like that? I like that. I

185
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:25,040
 don't even remember the names of all the guys. Mikey's just super embarrassed. He's like,

186
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,360
 "Seriously? This is the episode I'm on. You're reading a bad promo." Mikey, go ahead and call in

187
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,680
 that carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Campos de Ries, Brazil, and we are headed back to the

188
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:44,400
 United States. Specifically, we are headed out to Minnesota. And as we're headed back there,

189
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,560
 Mikey, hit that time travel button. We are leaving the present day and we are headed back

190
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:56,160
 to ancient Minnesota. This is long before the European settlers came to America. This is long

191
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:03,440
 before it was called America. This is the time where the natives ruled the continent. We're

192
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,200
 going to land this carpenter copter and we're walking around this frigid cold field of Minnesota.

193
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,480
 We're walking around and we see a village in the distance. It's getting dark. Mikey, thanks for

194
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,720
 landing so far away. We see the flames of the village in the distance. We're walking towards them.

195
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:36,400
 Apparently, there is a story among the Lakota Nation of a man known as the Faceless One.

196
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:45,360
 He's basically a boogie man that you would tell your children about to keep them in line.

197
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:55,040
 "Don't go out after dark or the Faceless Man will get you," Grandpa says. "Take out the garbage or

198
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,880
 the Faceless Man will get you. But Grandpa, it's dark outside. Take out the garbage. Take your chances.

199
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,040
 Faceless Man's right there. Do your homework." They're like, "I get it. Let me guess. Faceless

200
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:12,320
 Man's going to give me. Yes. Yes, you've learned well, young man." Here's the legend. There once

201
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,960
 was a member of a tribe who was the handsomest man in the land. We'll call him Barney. Barney is

202
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,800
 super good looking and he's so good looking that there are even women and other tribes who are

203
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,080
 like, "Oh my god. Did you read the newspaper today?" Barney is so hot. How is the headline of

204
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,200
 the newspaper? The Barney Times. It's publisher Barney. They're like, "Oh my god. He's so hot."

205
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 Women from other tribes are wanting to get with Barney and he's just like kind of in the beginning.

206
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,920
 He's like, "Oh, you know, that's really cool. I'm glad that I'm blessed. Some dude farted on my

207
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,080
 face when I was a baby. Next thing I know, I'm super hot." But as time went on, he wasn't so humble.

208
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,680
 He started to become very, very vain and he's like, "Yes, I am super hot, dude. I read the newspaper

209
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,440
 as well. I am super hot." And he starts to basically believe the hype. Women from other

210
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,960
 tribes are trying to get with them. Rivals don't like him. People in his own village don't like him

211
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
 at a certain point because he's such a jerk. He's so conceited and there's this old medicine man

212
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,520
 working in the village. He's making old medicine. It doesn't work. They just humor him. The young

213
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,240
 medicine men are much better. He's making medicine and Barney is always like, "Yo, you suck. You suck."

214
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,280
 He's just yelling into the dude's house, "You suck." He's like, "Man, I'm just trying to make my medicine.

215
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,680
 You suck, dude. Your medicine sucks too." He would constantly make fun of how old and ugly this

216
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,000
 guy was and the girls, "Hehehehe." Apparently he's dating the crypt keeper. The girls are just going

217
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,080
 along with it because, you know, they're in love with this dude. And the old medicine man's like,

218
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,960
 "Oh, I'm gonna get that guy one day. If only I can move more than one mile a day. I'll chase him down."

219
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,280
 "You suck. You're super ugly, dude. Barney rules." The old medicine man's like, "Oh, man,

220
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:11,520
 this existence sucks." But he knows something. He knows medicine and really implied he's like a

221
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,200
 witch. He's like a wizard, right? Like old medicine men like Shaman. Like, okay, let's take a break.

222
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,800
 Why is this guy picking on a man who has magical powers? Because it's not like he's like crushing

223
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,840
 up berries for people who have headaches. That's part of it. The other part of it is he's like

224
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,360
 going on vision quests and stuff like that. He's having vision quests where he's like beating up

225
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,800
 Barney. He's turning into a wolf and eating Barney. Why would you mess with a Shaman? So this medicine

226
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,320
 man's like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm done with this." But he lets it go on for a while. I think he figures,

227
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,720
 you know, eventually Barney's going to mature or he's going to get killed in some raid. One of the

228
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,120
 two. But eventually he's just done with it. So one day when Barney's walking through the village

229
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,560
 with all these girls and Barney's like, "Hey, what's up old man? Oh, not you. Not you. You're

230
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,960
 going to die soon because you're super old." Medicine man goes, "What? That doesn't even make sense.

231
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
 I mean, I'm up right now, but anyway, that doesn't matter. You're right though. I will die eventually

232
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,960
 because that's how things happen. All things die." Well, medicine man goes, "Listen, when I die and I'm

233
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,680
 going to die soon." Yeah, you die soon. He's like, "Okay, get it done. Get it done. That clean me about

234
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,400
 my death. I'm going to take your face with me. I'm going to die and I'm going to take your face off."

235
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,080
 And the dude's like, "What? That's super stupid. Like, that's not going to happen. I mean, it's not

236
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,560
 like I don't believe in all sorts of spirits and curses and things like that. What you are saying

237
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,120
 will not happen." The old man's like, "Okay, we'll see." A couple weeks later news passes through

238
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,840
 the village. The Barney who issued the Barney Times comes out. "Old man dead. He was ugly as

239
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,760
 hell," says Barney. And Barney goes, "Oh, you know, that knew he was going to die. I made fun of him

240
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,880
 a lot that he was old and he was going to die and my prediction came true." He's looking around for

241
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
 the next person, the next ugly person in the village to make fun of. He's like, "Ah, figure that out

242
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:17,680
 tomorrow." The next day when Barney wakes up, he has no mouth. He goes, he goes, "Okay, I feel like

243
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,240
 I have no mouth. Let me check with the nose." The nose is in there. Wait a second. I remember

244
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:32,320
 having two eyes. Do I have two eyes? No. His face is smooth. I don't know if he had ears,

245
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,640
 because technically that's not the face, but it's not like you'd be like, "Well, at least I have my

246
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,680
 ears." I mean, he has immediate problems. Like, he can't communicate. He can't breathe. He can't

247
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,760
 eat. He has a super smooth face. He jumps up and he runs out of his house. He's like, "Oh,

248
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 and people go, that is obviously some sort of demon. That's obviously some sort of monster.

249
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,080
 That man with no face and ears or not ears, but they chase him out of the village."

250
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:12,960
 Nobody can understand what he's saying. He leaves. They never see Barney again, but the people

251
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,200
 of this village aren't very smart. They don't put two and two together. A faceless man runs out of

252
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,760
 Barney's house a day after he was cursed to lose his face. Everyone goes, "Oh, I don't know."

253
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,080
 They put out one more issue of the Barney Times. Where is Barney? That's a collector's issue if

254
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,000
 you still have a copy of it. And that was the end of Barney. But the faceless man supposedly is still

255
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,680
 out there and he waits in the darkness for you. He wants your face off. He wants to steal your face

256
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,560
 and wear it because if he doesn't have one, maybe he can have yours.

257
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:55,280
 Now that's a really interesting boogieman legend. I came across it. I was reading this Reddit thread

258
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,120
 about Native American legends, Native American horror stories, and I found some really cool ones

259
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,000
 we're going to be covering. This was written by Skull Kid 00. Now they said it was a Lakota legend.

260
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,160
 I actually tried verifying that this is true. Not that it's true. I'm not like typing in faceless

261
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,560
 man. Did it happen? I'm trying to find archives of the Barney Times. I was trying to find out if it

262
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,840
 was a real Lakota legend. I was able to find that other tribe has a legend about why corn husk

263
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,240
 dolls don't have faces. It was basically the same thing. Once one of the gods created a corn husk

264
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,880
 doll and they put a face on it and it was animated and it walked from village to village. Everyone

265
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,200
 said how beautiful the doll was and it became super vain and eventually got punished by having

266
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 its face removed. That's why when you make a corn husk doll now you don't put a face on it because

267
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,200
 punishment is basically like a punishment for you to have a doll with no face and have it be

268
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,760
 super spooky. But like I said in the intro, the implications for us today. I'm not... this is

269
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,680
 really interesting because when I read this story by Skull Kid 00, an interesting boogieman story

270
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,160
 has a moral to it. It would totally scare kids. Having your face ripped off. It's spooky being

271
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,800
 having like a totally flat face. It's with no features. It's so inhuman. It's creepy. Tell

272
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,480
 that story to nine-year-old kid. They are going to take out the garbage. But then I thought about

273
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
 it a little bit longer. Let's put our conspiracy caps to wrap this episode up. This is really creepy.

274
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,240
 What if this is real? And not in the sense that the story of Barney is real,

275
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,040
 but the story of something out there taking our faces is real. You have it in Europe with the

276
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,360
 Faye. You have it in Europe with them stealing the children and replacing them with the

277
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,280
 Faye children. So we raise them and we think it's around the changelings. We discussed the story

278
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,640
 a couple weeks ago out of Morocco where you had Jin replacing human children with the Jin children

279
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,920
 to grow up in our world. And you have a ton of legends of shapeshifters and people assuming

280
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,720
 other people's shapes. You have the skinwalkers. You have them imitating people's voices. You

281
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,920
 have all these legends. You have a lot of them in America. And then you have others sprinkled out

282
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,400
 through the rest of the world. Let's take a look at this. This is really kind of spooky.

283
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:27,760
 What if, conspiracy cap fully on, that when people go missing, truly go missing and are found again,

284
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,600
 it's not them? Think about it this way. 600,000 people go missing in the United States each year.

285
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:45,280
 And that number is true, but it's a little off. It's a little lacking more information.

286
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,520
 600,000 people go missing, but by the end of the year, only 85,000 of those cases are still active.

287
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:59,120
 That's a huge amount of people, but most people are found in very, very short order. 95% of the

288
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:09,680
 600,000 people, they're runaways. 0.8% of them are non-custodial parents taking children. 0.1%

289
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,080
 is what we think about when we think about a missing person. 0.1% is someone who is not

290
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,320
 related to the person taking them from one location to another. I don't know how many of those are

291
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,160
 found again, but out of the total of 600,000 people by the end of the year, 85,000 people are still

292
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:35,440
 out there. The rest of the other 500,000 have returned home. What's really bizarre about this

293
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,520
 is that in the European Union, and it has double the population of the United States, 10,000 people

294
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,840
 go missing each year. Double the population, 10,000 people disappear each year. Who's to say

295
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:56,160
 they come home? They do on paper, and they do in reality. Somebody runs away, they're gone for two

296
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,160
 weeks, and then they come back, or they're picked up by the police, or they go stay at a friend's

297
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,880
 house, and their friend tells the parents, "Hey, we know where Judy is." But in that time where they

298
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,240
 leave their home, they are replaced. The whole thing about the faceless man, and boogeyman in

299
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,560
 general, it's about enforcing rules. Don't go out late. Don't, either like I had the joke about

300
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,480
 taking the garbage out, boogeyman or that type of thing, go to bed, or the boogeyman's gonna get

301
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,560
 you. It's all about enforcing rules. Running away is the ultimate rule break. You're leaving behind

302
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,640
 the social psychological network that's built up at home, and breaking all the rules by leaving

303
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,760
 and throwing away that command, throwing away those rules. You run away, you get on the bus,

304
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,280
 you get three blocks away, and you encounter something as you're turning down a dark alley,

305
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,520
 and you're found a couple days later. You return home willingly, the police pick you up, whatever.

306
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:02,160
 But it's something wearing their face. In that brief time where they're not

307
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,400
 around people who would know them when they're interacting with strangers,

308
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,840
 that would be the time that some sort of supernatural force could learn, could perfect

309
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,200
 the ins and outs of their body language. So by the time it does go back home,

310
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,120
 it blends in perfectly with who Judy was. And if we're talking about stranger abductions,

311
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,400
 if we're talking about people just being snatched off the street and never seen again,

312
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,520
 and that's, and I'm even focusing on just the quote unquote "benign" missing people, the people

313
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,680
 who run away. I'm not even focused on the people who get snatched out of their house,

314
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,520
 and then they're returned, and they're like, I don't know what happened. Some guy, he broke in,

315
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,880
 he was wearing a mask, he took me down there, and then there was an Amber Alert, and I get found.

316
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:56,720
 But what if these people aren't being found, but replacements of them, doppelgangers,

317
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,640
 the real them is still out there somewhere, if they're alive at all. If something like the

318
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,960
 faceless man was stealing people's faces and wearing them. Now there's only one of them,

319
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,240
 but who's to say that this legend is canon? Who's to say that this legend is not the story of just

320
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:28,000
 one but a race of cryptids, a race of beings that steal your face and wear it and become you,

321
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,240
 and no one's the wiser? No one except for one group of people. I talked about them in episode 59

322
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,760
 of the podcast, I'll put it in the show notes, but in brief, these people have brain damage.

323
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,120
 These people have undergone trauma. These people suffer from something known as

324
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,520
 Capgras Delusion. It's the idea that they can look at someone that they've known their entire life,

325
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,360
 and think they are a replacement. They're an android, they're a double, they're not the person

326
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,880
 that they knew them to be. The person they love, their wife, their child, has been removed somehow,

327
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,960
 and they're looking at this double. And is that person being dragged off to the hospital?

328
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,240
 The guys show up in the suits and they drag you off into the funny wagon, but according to Daffy

329
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,400
 Duck cartoons, that's how they used to do it. As they are being sent to a mental institution,

330
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,000
 and they're screaming, "That's not my wife, that's not my wife, that's not my wife,

331
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,400
 the wife is befuddled." No one can figure it out, the authorities just figure he must suffer

332
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,480
 from Capgras Delusion. The wife may not even be aware of when she went missing when she was three,

333
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,400
 for four hours. She was at the park with her family, and she walked into the brush, and they

334
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:55,440
 couldn't find her for hours and hours and hours, and the whole town panicked. There she is, but it

335
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:07,040
 wasn't her. The real her disappeared into those bushes forever, and a perfect replica waddled out,

336
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:15,360
 to the point that she doesn't even know she's a doppelganger. That is all being said with Conspiracy

337
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:21,200
 Cap fully on. I'm taking a real-life medical condition and tying it into Native American myths,

338
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,720
 but it's still creepy to think that the United States has six times the amount of missing people

339
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,240
 than the entire European Union and half the population. It could be something about our culture,

340
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,560
 it could be something about the way we treat our youth that makes them want to run away,

341
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,160
 that thinks they have a better chance outside of their own home, or it could be that this country

342
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,360
 is stalked by dark creatures. This land actually has entities that are not found on other places

343
00:34:51,360 --> 00:35:00,000
 on the planet. This land has something in the darkness that's not just snatching kids out of

344
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,840
 houses, but sometimes just whispers through the breeze. You're better off alone. You need to leave

345
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:23,520
 your house. You're better off alone. And these whispers gather and grow in the minds of these

346
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,360
 young people until they pack up, leave the house, and step out of the safety of the light,

347
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,480
 and into the unfamiliar darkness of the outside world. That might sound far-fetched,

348
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,720
 but on Friday I'm going to cover a Native American spirit that does exactly that,

349
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:54,400
 who whispers in the darkness, who is so powerful that in the modern day, people have called for

350
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,600
 the police to investigate this spirit. So it's not my imagination to think that a spirit

351
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,080
 can whisper through the darkness. Friday we're going to cover one that actually does it,

352
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:12,640
 but this one doesn't want to simply take your face and replace you. It wants to do something

353
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,600
 much, much worse. How's that for a tease for the rest of the week?

354
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,360
 GoodRabber Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't

355
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:43,600
 have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one guys.
