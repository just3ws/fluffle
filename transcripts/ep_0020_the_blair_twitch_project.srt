1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 From outer space to ghosts in your face.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 That was ghosts, not goats.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hey everyone, it's Jason Carpenter, the host of Dead Rabbit Radio. Hope you're having a great day.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It's 4th of July here, but I'm not, you won't be able to listen to this episode until the next July 5th.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 It doesn't really matter. I hope you guys had a great day today.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I just got back from the fireworks show hanging out.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I wanted to do a quick episode tonight.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Try to keep it quick. I always try to keep it quick, but they go on too long.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I got some really cool stories for you. Actually got some personal ghost stories.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Some really cool ghost references.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Some, what's the, you know, things you can use to hunt ghosts.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But first, I came across this really interesting article about space.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Space Wars. Now we've talked a bit about Space Wars since Donald Trump talked about bringing in the Space Force.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I said on a previous episode that, you know, I wanted to like, to have fighter craft flying through space and blowing stuff up.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 That's really kind of what you want in space. You want like Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Farscape,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers. That's all I can think of.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But we want like those, those space battles.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I read this article in Discover Magazine. And I'll obviously put the link below. It's fascinating.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 The headline is Space Wars Will Look Nothing Like Star Wars.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And it's kind of a buzzkill. The article's kind of a buzzkill.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Because basically it says that that would be the most ridiculous way to fight a space war is two ships flying at each other.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And what's interesting is the article says that, let's say I'm in an X-Wing and you're in a TIE fighter, because I'm obviously the good guy.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But original trilogy, not that sequel garbage. I'm in an X-Wing, you're in a TIE fighter.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Now, if we're on, if we're in, basically if we're two fighter jets in an atmosphere and I shoot you, all the pieces fall to the ground.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And let's say for whatever reason we're actually in ground vehicles, I shoot you and everything falls to the ground.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 In space, when you blow something up, you're basically causing that ship to become a shotgun forever.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Those little particles will, they'll blow up and you'll have, they'll be spreading out if fireworks still going off.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Like you'll blow up the TIE fighter, but then you're gonna have all these little pieces of debris that are just gonna float in that area of space.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 So slowly they would move away, but you would just get shredded.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 You would immediately have to get out of that area. If you blew it up, you would immediately have to get out of it, because now it's just all this micro debris that's just going to punch holes right through your armor.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Now obviously in Star Wars they have force fields and stuff like that, but we don't have anything like that.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And it's interesting because they're saying even the issue of when China has blown up satellites or we've blown up satellites, it creates a ton of debris up there.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So this is a quick little thing from the article. It says we have little ability to control or defend against that debris, which means the potential for collateral damage is high.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 It doesn't take much to shred metal when something is moving at 1700 miles per hour as objects in low Earth orbit are.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 A paint ship estimated to be the size of a grain of sand left a quarter inch pit in a space shuttle window, and the panes must occasionally be replaced because of similar impacts.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Something the size of a marvel could be devastating to a satellite.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 There's particularly talking about satellites, but so if we're fighting any sort of wars in Earth orbit, all that debris, it's not going to like float out into space.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's just going to become super cluttered.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So that's kind of a buzzkill.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You know, maybe they'll use some sort of laser weapons and just melt people like the other pilot.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 You just melt them while he's inside it.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But then you still have this vehicle cleaning out of control.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 If we're going to want to fight in space or at least around our orbit, we're going to have to come up with some different ways.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Different way to take care of that.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So I just thought that was a fascinating article.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Again, a bit of a buzzkill, but sometimes science is a buzzkill.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Sometimes science says, you know, there's no Minotars out there.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Speaking of Minotars, I actually saw a movie called Minotar.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It was terrible.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And it starred Tom Hardy.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And he was super young in it.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And you know, it was funny. It wasn't super bad, but it was just boring enough.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And then the movie glitched out halfway through and I didn't care.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 My friend was watching it.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 She actually had to look up the Inlena IMDB because she was curious, but the movie was terrible.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 But I'm getting to the point that science says a woman in a bowl can't have a baby.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 That's a bit of a buzzkill because it'd be cool if you could have a Minotar.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I, if humans could breed with animals, I would have a ton of babies.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Now, I know what you're thinking. It's because I have sex with animals and that's not the case.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I would only have sex with animals to create mutants.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I wouldn't have any fun.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I would do it just for, like, if you saw me, if I was banging a gram or a giraffe,

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I wouldn't be happy about it.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Like, I would be completely depressed.

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So don't make it out like I want to bang animals.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But I would totally have kids with, like, long necks and they're just, like, hitting dudes with their neck

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 or, like, babies that could, like, run as fast as a cheetah.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But I wouldn't enjoy a minute of it.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So don't, don't get that twisted.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I don't want to have sex with animals.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I wouldn't have fun with it.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Anyways, anyways, science is a buzzkill.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That's where I was going with that.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Now, one place that science is constantly trying to be a buzzkill is ghosts.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 It's afterlife. They're constantly saying, "There's no proof. There's no proof of ghosts.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 There's no proof of the afterlife."

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And I always say, you know, I mean, you can't really measure something that's after we die.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 We don't have any, we can't really measure it.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Like, you say there's no proof, and fair enough, there probably is, like, technically, scientifically no proof.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 That's not gonna, don't try to bring me down, science man, because I at least believe in an afterlife.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Now, ghosts I'm a little more iffy on.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I believe there's some types of ghosts.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And again, I think I kind of put it in that whole alien category where I don't know if they're to cease humans

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 or if it's something from another reality or something from another dimension that we're seeing.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But let's accept for a moment that something as what we would describe as a ghost exists.

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So is that, that Fourth of July party?

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Sanging out with this girl, a woman.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And, you know, generally I'll ask people, you know, she works for the forest department or something.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And I go, you know, I'll ask people, do you ever see anything creepy in the woods?

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And she's like, I haven't.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Well, actually there's two girls, but women.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 The first one said I haven't, but my friend here has seen a ghost, so I asked the friend, I go, so you've seen a ghost.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Forget that I said any of that.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 The main point of the story is I'm talking to this woman who says she saw ghosts.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Now, I thought this was a creepy story, not just because of the visual, but because the way she described it,

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 because it's similar to kind of things that I've seen.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Here are a lot of ghost stories, and I kind of have to take them with a grain of salt unless it's something close to something that I've seen with my own eyes.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So this young woman is getting into her car late at night.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 She works in the forest department, whatever.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 There's something around trees, so she's in the middle of the tree area.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 It's nighttime, there's much trees around, which I hate forest, I think they're spooky.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 She's getting in her car and she has a feeling somebody's watching her.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 She's a, you know, young woman, not like a, couldn't really like beat a bear up or anything like that.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Not like I could, but she has a feeling something's watching her and she turns around and probably about,

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I've described it as maybe eight feet away from her, ten feet, ten feet away from her around that, very close.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's a woman standing there, the woman's taller than her, it's long brown hair,

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 she's dressed in white, she said it was like a white smock,

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and she's looking at the woman and she looks at her for not long,

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 she takes in all this visual information, when she said her feet seem to not be touching the ground.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But what was more shocking to my friend was that the woman appeared to be two dimensional.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 She seemed to be out of place of the reality around her.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It was like almost like an image, instead of a real person, like an apparition,

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 where you can see like how the legs curve around, when you're looking at a real person,

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 and you kind of see the dimensions around them, she said it was almost like a two dimensional picture,

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 placed against the backdrop of the trees.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Now my friend just turned around from it, like she goes,

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I immediately recognize that this was a ghost in the middle of the woods at like 10, 11 o'clock at night.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 She's by herself, there are other people in this house or something like that.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 She turns around and she goes, all I did, I started getting the stuff I needed out of the car,

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and I was just thinking, I'm not here to hurt you, I'm not here to hurt you.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 She's trying to like calm it down through her like her mental thoughts,

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 and she just took off and went into the house, and she said she didn't come out,

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 she went and talked to her friend, or she didn't come go back out until the daytime.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Now I would just quit, if that was the case, because I don't like the woods anyways,

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and if I saw a ghost like that.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But I think that's interesting how the ghost appeared to be outside of the visual,

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 the way that we would interpret visual data.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 There's a lot of times I'll say, you know, we may see something, we may get a feeling that there's something in the corner of the room,

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and we look over at it and there's nothing there, and there could actually be something there,

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 and our brain isn't letting us register all the information, because it's what you'd go into shock if you saw it.

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So you look over and you get a creepy feeling that there's something in the doorway,

134
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 when really there's like a young man with like half of his face ripped off,

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 chattering his teeth and like jerking violently.

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But you don't, your mind won't let you perceive that reality, so it just makes you look over and go,

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "Oh, I get a weird feeling," but you're not seeing the skeletal hands like clutching,

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 like it's having a seizure, you just get a weird feeling.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And then maybe a couple of nights later you have a dream of that figure walking up behind you in a dream.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Because your brain, your eyes perceived it, your brain's not letting you really understand that information.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And I think that might be something akin to what she saw, that she saw something,

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 and her brain is just like, "Oh, this doesn't fit reality as you know it, so it's just going to be a jumble of information and signals."

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Super creepy.

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Now, one thing I was talking to someone, we have a haunted grocery, apparently a haunted grocery store across the river here.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 We're in Hood River, but in White Salmon or Bingen there's a haunted store called Thriftway.

146
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And I've talked about setting cameras up there.

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And then I thought about, why don't people have, I was thinking, you know what, I have a great idea,

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 streaming cameras in haunted hot spots, so basically there's just cameras,

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 places in all these places that are supposedly haunted so people can just constantly watch them and look for movement.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And so you're basically crowdsourcing ghost hunting.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And then I kind of sat back and I kind of like put my thumbs under my suspenders and I was like,

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 "I'm a genius to come up with that idea."

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And then I thought, "I wonder if someone's already done it."

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So I googled haunted house streaming cameras and a ton of people have done it,

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and it's, which just shows great minds think alike.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I went to one website and I'll put it in the links.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 It's actually Paranormal New Zealand, is this website, but they have video footage from famous haunted places around the world.

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's pretty creepy.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Now I'm not saying it's creepy because you see like a little girl creeping off into the distance or you see,

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 you know what, and I'll tell you, people who say orbs are ghosts, that is the dumbest thing in the world.

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Orbs are not ghosts.

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 What happened was everyone bought a camera and now they're like, "Yes, I can capture ghosts."

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 They can't capture anything on video, but a dust piece flew across and then they go,

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 "Oh no, orbs are magical ghost aura gumdrops or whatever."

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's so stupid.

166
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 When anyone ever says, "I have a haunting, let me show you this picture."

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 There's orbs.

168
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I immediately dismiss everything that they have to say about anything ghost-wise.

169
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 It is dust.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It is 100% dust.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Because we can look at old photos and you'll see full body apparitions or half apparitions or stuff like that.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Most of those are fake anyways.

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And then when you meet people and they're like, "Yeah, I saw the ghost. I saw the ghost of my dead grandma walking in the hallway."

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 No one ever says, "I woke up at 3 in the morning, I walked down the hallway and I saw an orb."

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Because that's something totally different.

176
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Orbs are like the, orbs are the hand job of the paranormal world, really.

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It's not good enough to actually be a ghost.

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Seeing a full body ghost would be oral sex.

179
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And interacting with a ghost, seeing a ghost and it being like, "Hello, Jason, this is your future."

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 That would be actual sex.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But just seeing an orb in a picture, you know what, it's not even a hand job.

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It's like a handshake.

183
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It's a handshake with someone who you don't want to be around.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Orbs are the stupidest thing.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I hate it when people are like, "Dude, look at these orbs."

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They're dumb.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But anyways, so you can watch this footage.

188
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And it's creepy because I'm watching footage from all these different, right, I would, before I started doing the podcast, I was looking at,

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 they're set up these webcams in this library at Indiana.

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And I'm looking at a podcast right now.

191
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It's of the children's book room and that's where they say the gray lady's at.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 The lady in gray, sorry.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I'm not seeing like a woman creeping or I'm not seeing like a young child like Giga-Leen as he's looking around the corner.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I'm not seeing books fly off the shelves.

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 That would be creepy, but I also just think, I think I've gone over this before, I find empty places creepy.

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The fact that in Indiana there's this room where there's just nothing going on, it's just pitch dark in this room.

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I always find empty spaces, especially empty buildings, creepy.

198
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 So not only is it creepy because I'm looking at it and I'm trying to see if there's ghosts,

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I just find a sense of utter loneliness that there are these rooms all over the planet that just no one's in right now.

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And it's just a dark light and all these books that tell all these wonderful stories are just trapped in darkness.

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 That's creepy to me.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 That's probably just as creepy to me as if I saw a little kid like, no, no, the little kid scurrying across is creepier,

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 but this is a close second.

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And I'm going to go ahead, we're going to wrap this episode up with just one more ghost thing,

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 because I think it's fascinating and we need your help to get it done.

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I need everyone to send me $100 because I can prove ghosts exist.

207
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I'm just joking.

208
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 There's this thing called house creep.

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And what it is, is you put in the address and it'll tell you if you live in a haunted house,

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 if you live in a house where a murder took place or there was drug operation or section such,

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and it won't, you can look for your whole area.

212
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 So it's not just a matter of, it has to be your house, you can do that or you can look in your neighborhood,

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 but it's crowdsourced.

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So right now it doesn't, and I'm not affiliated with these guys, I just found this the other day.

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 You put in places you know that are haunted or that murders took place or crimes took place.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 You can upload it to the site now.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Obviously if it's a murder or if it's a drug house, they want proof of a news article or something like that.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 But for ghosts, they said we understand them mostly anecdotal and they'll go through it and decide whether or not to put it on their site.

219
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 But I'm going to go ahead and put this in here, see if there's any haunted places in your neighborhood.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I think that was always kind of cool.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 If you know of a haunted place in your neighborhood, go ahead and they're not on the list, go ahead and add them to it.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Because I think that's always part of the fun factor, is finding these haunted places and going to them.

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And again, 99.9% of the time there's nothing there or it's faulty pipes or you know, just a kind of a,

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 you may be feel unease because of other stuff that's going on, but there's no ghosts.

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 But yeah, let's get this right now. They only have like 25,000 properties across the United States.

226
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 So I know we can get more of those.

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So if you're listening to this podcast and you know some places in your area, go here and fill it out.

228
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And again, I'm not affiliated with these guys at all. I just think it's a really cool project.

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So tonight I wanted to make it a quick episode because we're recording late.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But I also wanted to make it a fun episode. I think the ghost stories are always fun.

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I love hearing people's ghost stories.

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Sometimes again, people will tell me ghost stories and I don't include them on the show because I don't necessarily think they're making them up.

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I just don't think it's that juicy. But what that young woman told me matches up to stuff.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I've seen, because I've also seen ghosts that it looks like they're removed from their reality, put into our reality,

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 and the lighting doesn't jive, the physics doesn't jive to what's going on around it.

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And someday I'll tell you those ghost stories, my personal ghost stories, but I think I'm going to save those for Halloween.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I know I've been talking a mile a minute, but I'm not doing meth.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I know I've done a lot of meth heavy episodes, but I have been doing a Sudafed PE, not the other ones,

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 but I've been taking Sudafed for my Sudafed PE for my sinus infection. It's a little bit better.

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But we're going to go ahead and end this night out.

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So again, DeadRabbit.com is where you can find all of our episodes.

242
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And you know if you can rate and review us on wherever you're getting your podcast, that'd be great.

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 We're constantly getting more downloads, we're constantly getting more listeners, and with your help we can keep growing this series.

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 So DeadRabbit.com is the website.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You can follow me at Twitter @JasonOCarpenter and my email address is DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com.

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000

247
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 We can help grow this podcast together. Again, I'm having a great time doing it.

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I really hope you guys are having a great time listening to it. I keep seeing more and more people downloaded all the time.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So I hope that we've kind of stumbled onto something.

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I am going to wrap this episode up and I will see you again tomorrow. Have a great day.

251
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
