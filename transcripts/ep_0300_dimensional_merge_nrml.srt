00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 299 episodes ago.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,280
 Look out!

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,280
 Oh no!

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
 Hurry up!

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
 Run down that alley, Jason!

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,840
 You just got away from doing nothing for the rest of my life, because I'm a big, lazy

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
 bum.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
 What's this?

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,520
 Going through the garbage.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,520
 Whoa.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,560
 It's a book on how to podcast.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,720
 Then I'm at home, doing music stuff, not doing music stuff, music's playing, I'm typing

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
 in the computer.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,680
 Podcasts doing stuff.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,000
 And then, hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Everyone's cheering.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,880
 Yay, people are carrying me down the street.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,360
 Wow, this podcasting thing sure is awesome.

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,200
 And then the bad guys pound, pound on the table.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
 We hate Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,480
 This podcast sucks.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,000
 He's too awesome.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,920
 And then it's like fast forward a couple of episodes.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
 Now we're on episode 250 and I'm meeting the president.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
 Hello, Mr. President.

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,360
 This is a non-political podcast, so I'm not naming what administration this is.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
 Shaking your hand, getting a medal.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 Yay.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,080
 And then fighter jets flying after me and running.

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,040
 I'm not running fighter jets.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,760
 And then Mormon Bigfoot shows up, me take you.

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
 Actually it's more like Mungo.

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,440
 Mungo shows up, me take you and hide you like a baby.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,960
 I'll swaddle you and then I'm in a little baby bouncer.

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,320
 And then we're here, episode 300.

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,040
 It's a cliffhanger.

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,760
 What happens to Mungo?

38
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,960
 Maybe Mungo and Mormon Bigfoot raise me as their child.

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
 We don't know.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,960
 We'll find out on this episode and yes, we will finally talk about the dimensional merge

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,760
 today on the 300th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,040
 Run Mungo, run.

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,760
 Run as fast as can.

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,760
 Explosion and then you see in this smoke Dead Rabbit Radio 300th episode.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:07,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 I'm having a great day.

48
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
 Let's go ahead and get started here with our Patreons.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,560
 We got two new Patreons today and I'm noticing a very bizarre trend.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
 Not that people are supporting my Patreon.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,360
 I have about like 34, 35 Patreons Patreons and one time I went to a bar, there was this

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,960
 fancy bar called the Elephant Bar in Sacramento.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,040
 I go in, had a bunch of money at the time.

55
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,960
 I walk into this bar with my buddy Howe.

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
 I sit down and I order a shot.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,560
 I'm looking at this menu and I go, "I'll have the patron."

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
 The waitress goes, "You mean Patrone?"

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
 And I look at her and I go, "The only reason I ordered that one, because it's the only

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,360
 one I could pronounce on your menu."

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,240
 And she's like, "But anyway, so, our Patreons, this is the new conspiracy.

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,640
 William Thompson is my latest Patreon."

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 Whatever.

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,760
 He's my latest Donator to my Patreon.

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,440
 I have 34 Patreons and three of them are named Will.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
 A statistical anomaly.

67
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,280
 I have a Will and then two Williams.

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
 It's very, very bizarre.

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,720
 Now I just need a couple Billies and a few Bills and the conspiracy Stevens.

70
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,760
 Thank you William for being part of the conspiracy and being part of the Patreon.

71
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,840
 And then we have Huge Wapping Penis.

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,880
 Thank you, Huge Wapping Penis.

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,400
 Is what everyone says every single day.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
 Thank you, Huge Wapping Penis.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,600
 And thank you specifically for supporting the Patreon.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,400
 I really, really appreciate all the support I'm getting.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,880
 Whether it's on the Patreon or whether you guys are just hope getting the word out about

78
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,160
 the show, I appreciate it very, very much.

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,360
 Now let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 I'm going to be totally frank with you guys.

81
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
 It's 11.40.

82
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,640
 I have been recording since 10 trying to do the dimensional merge story.

83
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,800
 Yesterday, I recorded for probably about an hour and a half trying to do the dimensional

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,160
 merge story.

85
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,800
 And Friday spent probably another hour trying to record it.

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,000
 The story doesn't work.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It doesn't work.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,560
 And I know a couple of you guys have been like, "Oh dude, I'm so hyped for this episode."

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,720
 And I'm like, "Lower your expectations because here's the problem."

90
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,640
 I've covered a lot of people on this show like Hans, the person who believes that monkeys

91
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,800
 aren't real.

92
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,640
 Michael Milken, the person who believes he has hats that cure autism and will protect

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
 you from aliens.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,600
 John Storm was a very early episode.

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,040
 He believes he's a super soldier the government created and now he's the only thing that can

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 destroy them.

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
 He actually found the show, by the way.

98
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,560
 I think I mentioned that before.

99
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
 He found the show and was like, "Oh, you government stoogey or something like that."

100
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
 I just didn't engage.

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
 Michael Milken found the show as well.

102
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
 I'm sure Hans has at this point.

103
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,320
 But Nudles and Beep was the guy who was part of that giant muscle bound cult and things

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 like that.

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,040
 Forrest Finn is another person we've covered.

106
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,000
 I've covered solo people before that I believe...Forrest Finn's a bit different.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Forrest Finn doesn't really belong with these other guys that I mentioned, but I've covered

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,440
 these people before and they have mentally ill beliefs.

109
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,880
 Believing that monkeys are fake and every monkey is a man in a suit or a puppet is a

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,480
 belief that a mentally ill person has.

111
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,960
 I honestly don't think that Hans is mentally ill.

112
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,480
 I think Hans is a rational human being with a delusional belief.

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,440
 When I was trying to tell the story of Chris Chan, Chris Chan, Christian Weston Chandler,

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,360
 now Christine Weston Chandler, because Chris is now a trans woman, but for decades for

115
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
 the most of their infamy was a man.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,200
 The story of Chris is actually, by all accounts, suffers from some form of mental illness.

117
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,280
 The very least, a very very autistic person.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,720
 And I wasn't having any fun recording it.

119
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
 I really wasn't having any fun recording it.

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,360
 Because it's one thing to say, look at this person with this crazy belief, it's another

121
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,120
 thing to say, look at this person who, by their own account suffers from severe autism.

122
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
 Let's make fun of this person.

123
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,040
 I wasn't making fun of Chris.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
 I found it very dismal.

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,960
 I was just kind of listing weird things that Chris did.

126
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
 It wasn't fun.

127
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
 It was really boring.

128
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,160
 It seemed borderline, mean spirited.

129
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,080
 And I just kept scrapping the episodes, kept scrapping it.

130
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,280
 Now we can still talk about the dimensional merge.

131
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,760
 That's something different, but I really don't want to go into who Chris Chan is as a person.

132
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,560
 It just wasn't something that fit the tone of the show.

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,640
 It really wasn't.

134
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,160
 So I apologize.

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,920
 I hope you guys understand that rationale.

136
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,760
 And it may turn out that someone I've covered does actually suffer from a real mental illness.

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,200
 I feel bad about that.

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,120
 But again, I don't think that the other people I've covered are actually mentally ill.

139
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,680
 I just think they have bizarre or dangerous beliefs, or both.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,000
 Chris Chan is honestly probably, and I think people who know about Chris, and I feel bad

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,600
 that I'm just kind of glossing over a bunch of stuff, but I think people who know about

142
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,040
 Chris would agree that Chris is probably the most well-documented non-celebrity of modern

143
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
 times.

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,440
 So there's no lack of resources on Chris, but he just felt gross.

145
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
 It didn't really feel fun.

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
 But let's go ahead.

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,680
 We can still talk about the dimensional merge, because even though that idea comes from Chris,

148
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,400
 it actually came from trolls who infiltrated Chris's brain, because Chris is incredibly

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,840
 susceptible to any belief that is put in front of Chris.

150
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
 It was actually created by trolls.

151
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,400
 But anyways, I think the idea of the dimensional merge can be bigger than Chris, and I hope

152
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 it can.

153
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,560
 So we're going to go ahead, and I apologize for people who were expecting me to just rip

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,280
 on this mentally ill kid for a half hour.

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
 It just didn't have any...

156
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
 I didn't like doing it.

157
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,280
 It was not the tone of the show, and it was just an info dump, and it was just boring.

158
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,600
 I have at least, at least, four or five hours of starts and stops trying to tell that story.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,080
 So we're going to use that as a launching point.

160
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
 I'm explaining all that stuff.

161
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,440
 We're going to use that as a launching point.

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,360
 Let's talk about what the dimensional merge is, though, because it's honestly something...

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,160
 Because again, I did my due diligence, and I kept researching it much.

164
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,160
 I've been following the story of Chris Chan for almost 11 years at this point.

165
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,240
 The dimensional merge is something that other people actually believe in.

166
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,880
 So what is the dimensional merge?

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
 The dimensional merge is this.

168
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,920
 It's kind of a fascinating idea.

169
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,800
 That the fictional worlds out there are real.

170
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 And it's an idea that I think people believe in as children.

171
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
 So when you're watching a cartoon, kids are stupid, right?

172
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
 When you're watching a cartoon, as an adult, you understand that that cartoon is fake.

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
 But children can't tell the difference between what is real and what is fake.

174
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,440
 And that's usually a key indicator of how functional a human brain is.

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,640
 Because by the time you're an elementary school student, or especially when you're an adult,

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
 you should know the difference that Bugs Bunny isn't real, even though we cover an episode

177
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,160
 that Bugs Bunny may be real.

178
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,400
 What do we find so fascinating about the fictional worlds?

179
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,000
 Like we, you know for a fact, and I know for a fact, that Star Wars is not real.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
 But if someone came to you and said, you know those are documentaries, right?

181
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,920
 Like those stories actually happen.

182
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,240
 Would it give you, first off, you'd be like, you mean there really is a Kylo Ren and all

183
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,240
 that stuff and the sequels happen and they're like, yeah, yeah, totally true.

184
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 You're like, ahhh.

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,880
 Luke Skywalker fell and hit his head on a bunch of rocks and died.

186
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,040
 They're like, it's not really what happened, Jason.

187
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
 That's the movie.

188
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,360
 But yes, all that stuff would happen.

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,960
 Would it make your appreciation for fiction higher or lower?

190
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,800
 There are some people who argue that.

191
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,480
 It doesn't have to be real for it to be more entertaining.

192
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,120
 But I would say that if you knew for a fact that Spider-Man was real somewhere out there,

193
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,640
 that would make things more exciting, or more amazing, right?

194
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,760
 And that's kind of the idea of the dimensional merge.

195
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,640
 And there are a lot of people who believe that the fictional world is real.

196
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,000
 And you go, Jason, are you sure about that?

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,520
 Okay, so as I was researching all this stuff and trying to avoid recording more stuff about

198
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,680
 Chris, I came across some interesting stuff.

199
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,400
 Let's go to Gay Street.

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
 Let's hop on the Carpenter Copter.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,120
 We're flying to a real place.

202
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
 I don't know if it's still called Gay Street.

203
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,200
 It would be hilarious if it was.

204
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,560
 But Gay Street, New York City.

205
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,440
 We're going to New York City.

206
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,640
 Gay Street in YC.

207
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,360
 There's a ghost there, known as the Gay Street Ghost, which again, is awesome.

208
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,920
 If I ever become a ghost, I hope I'm a hilariously named ghost, like the underwear bandit or something

209
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
 like that.

210
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
 I guess it would have to be a ghost to have that nickname.

211
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,760
 But I hope that my specter is like a cool name, like the teddy bear, I don't know, the

212
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
 teddy bear bandit.

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
 You don't need to be a ghost to be a teddy bear bandit either.

214
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,280
 I just hope it's something awesome.

215
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,160
 If I was like the Chex Mix Ghost, that'd be really boring.

216
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,720
 I'm just haunting your bowl of disgusting cereal.

217
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,360
 Anyways, Gay Street Ghost.

218
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
 There was this sightings of this ghost on Gay Street.

219
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
 The Gay Street Ghost.

220
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,720
 He was seen as a tall gentleman, a tall man, in formal clothes.

221
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
 So he has a little top hat, a little tie, jacket.

222
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,520
 You guys know what a formal person looks like.

223
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,400
 And he had a black cape and a cane.

224
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,600
 And he was sighted walking around Gay Street, right?

225
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
 He is spotted around this area.

226
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,840
 Now there was a paranormal researcher investigating the Gay Street Ghost.

227
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,880
 And he ends up making a bizarre discovery.

228
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,480
 He talks to some people who used to live in the area and they're like, it was two dudes.

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,000
 Walter Gibson and Ed Burkholder lived in that area, right?

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And he's talking to them.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
 He's like, yeah, you know, I've been seeing this ghost walk around.

232
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,080
 He described it.

233
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,480
 And Walter and Ed look at each other and they go, oh, that's weird.

234
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,080
 Because when we lived on Gay Street, we created the character known as the shadow.

235
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,560
 The shadow knows that old movie with Alec Baldwin, which actually had some interesting

236
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
 ideas in it.

237
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,760
 The movie itself wasn't that great, but they said we created this character named the shadow.

238
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,400
 And who you're describing is basically a Batman type character.

239
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 He was a vigilante.

240
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,200
 But the way they were describing the Gay Street Ghost matched up perfectly to the Phantom's

241
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,960
 crime fighting garb.

242
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,040
 So were they inspired by the ghost?

243
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,640
 Was the ghost a topa of the shadow?

244
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,720
 Let's go ahead and meet an old dude.

245
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,760
 An old guy who you may know.

246
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,480
 His name is Alan Moore, very, very famous comic book author.

247
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
 He created the character John Constantine.

248
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
 He worked of his comic book.

249
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,660
 The comic book was called Hellblazer.

250
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
 He created the comic book character John Constantine.

251
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,600
 He said that one day he was sitting in a bar in England drinking a pint, looking around

252
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,000
 the bar, and a man walks down the stairs in the bar.

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,520
 And Alan Moore is sitting there and he's like, uh, like freezes as he's drinking his

254
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,920
 beer and he looks and it's John Constantine.

255
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,200
 And he said John Constantine was based on the character, John Constantine was based

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
 on the singer Sting.

257
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
 And he goes first, I thought it was Sting.

258
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,840
 Looked exactly like Sting.

259
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,720
 But then I realized it was John Constantine walking down the stairs of this bar and he

260
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,240
 looked over at me and he gave me a knowing smile and then round to the corner and I sat

261
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,280
 there with my pint and I thought, should I follow him?

262
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,880
 And I go, no, better leave well enough alone.

263
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 So you have two people who've created these fictional characters, both show up in real

264
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
 life.

265
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,720
 We have someone else who worked on the Hellblazer comic book.

266
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,560
 This guy's name is, did I write it down?

267
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,680
 Yes, I did, because I'm prepared.

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,960
 Dave McKean also worked on Hellblazer.

269
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,160
 He was walking through an airport one day, right?

270
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,520
 And he saw a girl that looked exactly like Death.

271
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,200
 Now not that she looked like she was about to die.

272
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
 Death was a character that was created by Neil Gaiman.

273
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Maybe wasn't created by Neil Gaiman, definitely popularized by Neil Gaiman, but very, very

274
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,760
 small, pale, gothic girl who was the personification of Death in these, it wasn't image.

275
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
 It was a comic book imprint.

276
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,060
 Vertigo, Vertigo.

277
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,480
 So he sees her walk by him in an airport and he's like, that's weird.

278
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,080
 And then he hears that near the terminal where he saw her walking by, someone had just died

279
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
 on the airplane.

280
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,640
 So he always thought that that was Death leaving the airplane, because then he says he turned

281
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,760
 around and he couldn't see her anymore, like she vanished.

282
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,320
 Now that story is completely ridiculous because this airport that he was at was in San Diego

283
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,040
 and he was there for Comic-Con.

284
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,880
 So it was most likely a cosplayer, but he seems to think that this was actually comic

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,760
 book character come to life.

286
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,440
 This one's the weirdest one of the bunch, though.

287
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,320
 If you thought all that stuff was just kind of a weird combination of things, this one

288
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 was really odd.

289
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,160
 In the 1970s, there's a comic book author named Doug Monak and he wrote for The Planet

290
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,240
 of the Apes comic book.

291
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,360
 You're starting to see a weird parallel here, right?

292
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
 We'll get into that in a second.

293
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,880
 He's writing The Planet of the Apes comic book, right?

294
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,840
 And he had just got done writing this scene where there's this bad ape named Brutus who

295
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,400
 pulled a gun out and stuck it to a woman's head.

296
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,280
 And the ape was in the comic books to wear this big black cloak.

297
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,640
 So he's writing this comic book and he's like, oh yeah, this will be awesome.

298
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,480
 Brutus pulls out this old revolver, blow your brains out, girl, and puts the gun to

299
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 the girl's head.

300
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,480
 And right when he gets done writing that part, here's his wife scream and he immediately

301
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,640
 jumps up from his bench, his desk, that's the word I'm looking for.

302
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,560
 He jumps up from his desk and he runs into the other room and what he sees is something

303
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,880
 in a black cloak holding his wife in a headlock pushing a gun against her temple.

304
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
 Here's this quote that Doug had.

305
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,320
 It was exactly what I had written.

306
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,640
 It was so immediate in relation to the writing and such, an exact duplicate of what I had

307
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,880
 written that it became an instant altered state.

308
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,360
 The air in the room congealed, became almost like a fog and yet, paradoxically, I could

309
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
 see with greater clarity.

310
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,520
 I could see the individual threads of his black hood.

311
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,920
 It really does make you wonder.

312
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,800
 Are you seeing the future?

313
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
 Are you creating a reality?

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,040
 Should you give up writing forever after something like that happens?

315
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
 I don't know.

316
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,960
 For years after that, Doug had severe writer's block because the question always was, is

317
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,920
 what I'm writing true?

318
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,200
 I write, I don't write as much as I used to, obviously, because I'm doing the podcast.

319
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,760
 And there is a, I'm going to give a tip to you guys out there who are writers.

320
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,280
 You know you're on to something, you know your characters click when they don't do what

321
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
 you want them to.

322
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,640
 It's a very, very weird thing.

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,360
 I learned this trick or I learned this lesson a long time ago.

324
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,120
 If your characters are fully fleshed out and you want them to do something in a plot that

325
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,200
 your characters would not do, either they won't do it or the plot completely falls

326
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,480
 apart.

327
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,960
 It's a very, very bizarre thing.

328
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,240
 So it kind of gives them the sense that they are real independent people.

329
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,360
 And we can put so much brain power into the fictional world.

330
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,160
 Sometimes we may spend more time in a fictional world than we spend in our own world, really.

331
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,840
 And a lot of times they bleed over.

332
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,680
 A lot of times they bleed over.

333
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,200
 There was this study done by Durham University.

334
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,360
 They said one fourth of people reading books, when they're done reading the stories that

335
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,280
 they're really involved in, can hear the characters' voices in everyday events.

336
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,800
 They walk into a Starbucks and they hear a "Ahoy, Metis!" and they look over and there

337
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,680
 is Captain Ahab serving coffee.

338
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
 Which is actually where Starbucks is from.

339
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,200
 I know a lot of people aren't aware of that.

340
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,800
 That's why they have the mermaid.

341
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,120
 Starbucks was a character who was constantly drinking coffee during Moby Dick.

342
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
 That's where that name's from.

343
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,080
 So people will hear, have audio hallucinations of fictional characters while they're out

344
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 doing other stuff.

345
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,760
 Because you get so engrossed in the novel, the question is, is fiction actually true?

346
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,120
 And the dimensional merge is not just these things intruding in real life, but it's actually

347
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,640
 the doomsday of reality.

348
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,540
 Because the theory is that, and we're taking it to the extremes now, to the extreme we're

349
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,280
 taking it to the point where the fictional world actually collides with our world.

350
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,800
 So Chicago becomes not only Gotham City, but every fictional version of Chicago possible.

351
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,880
 And it would cause this huge cataclysm, and this is, we're going back to the Christian

352
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,240
 theory here, it causes this massive cataclysm that'll kill millions of people, only bad people

353
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 though.

354
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,720
 And then good people will be available to hang out with all of their favorite fictional characters.

355
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,040
 Luke Skywalker's walking around, Darth Vader, Superman, Mickey Mouse, whatever.

356
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,200
 It'll just be in this huge world, which to me sounds like hell.

357
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,640
 I talked about how much I would enjoy the character of the Joker, but how I would never

358
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,000
 want to exist in the same city as him.

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,280
 That's basically this times 10.

360
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,440
 Because every fictional possibility is automatically now available on Earth.

361
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,600
 Which makes me wonder about all the Cthulhu mythos, because all that stuff's going to

362
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,160
 show up as well, but yeah, it's just a lot of people, so that's back to them, that's

363
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,000
 kind of wrapping up the dimensional merge part.

364
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You guys are like, "That took you three days!"

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,280
 I was like, "Yeah, that's what you get for three days."

366
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,600
 Try not hyping it up.

367
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,920
 The dimensional merge, I think, is an interesting idea that the two realities will collide.

368
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,440
 I think it's a more interesting and more likely idea that these things are constantly impeding,

369
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,080
 or not impeding, interrupting our lives, these little things.

370
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,560
 You know, going back to the thing is me as a writer.

371
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,680
 And this is going to probably be super revealing about myself, but when I was 12 years old,

372
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:44,840
 I created a fictional world where it was this alien planet where there was one dude, which

373
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,440
 it was as self-insert for myself, obviously, I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

374
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,760
 There's one dude, and everyone else was a woman.

375
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,800
 It was basically an alien race, they're humanoids, but they didn't have males.

376
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
 They was a genetic anomaly, someone would be born a male.

377
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
 It was all women that could breed with other women.

378
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,880
 They were called the "Skrin."

379
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,560
 It was this completely warlike, brutal race.

380
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,840
 The time that the boy shows up, whose name was Jason, of course.

381
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,040
 I was 12, okay?

382
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
 I was 12.

383
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,120
 See, I can't, instead of making fun of Chris, let's make fun of myself for a bit, be self-revealing.

384
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,240
 12 years old came up with this story.

385
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,920
 There's this race of aliens called the "Skrin."

386
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 It's all women.

387
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,800
 And by the, they're this completely warlike race, and by the time that Jason shows up,

388
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,840
 they've basically gotten mired in petty political squabbles and their traitors and stuff like

389
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
 that.

390
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,080
 And Jason shows up and is a great pilot, of course.

391
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,160
 He's really good mechanically, which is funny because I'm not good at either of those things.

392
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,880
 And he ends up causing all of this chaos and throws the empire back into this brutal warlike

393
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,560
 state, i.e. the way it should have always been.

394
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,520
 And I told this story until every night, I would tell myself this story.

395
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,040
 It's basically my own bedtime story, and I have this storyline carry on.

396
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,880
 And I did it from probably about like 12, I wouldn't say every night, but a lot of,

397
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,680
 probably about 12 to 17, 18.

398
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,280
 I was building this mythos.

399
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,200
 I was telling this story, and occasionally I would write stuff down.

400
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,680
 I would either write notes or actually write short stories in this world of the skrin.

401
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,880
 And then fast forward, maybe like 10 years ago, something like that.

402
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,520
 And I stopped doing it for years and years and years.

403
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,760
 I came up with another story, which was more like grounded in reality, but it was the same

404
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,680
 thing I would basically tell myself a bedtime story, chapter by chapter, every night.

405
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,360
 Probably about 10 years ago I thought.

406
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 Maybe not even that.

407
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
 I think it was actually only five years ago.

408
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
 I said, "I'm gonna do a gritty retcon.

409
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,040
 I'm gonna do a gritty retcon of the skrin.

410
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,520
 I'm gonna start that story over from the beginning, but now as an adult having a different viewpoint,

411
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,560
 I'm going to see where this story takes me."

412
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 And so I did.

413
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,440
 I started the story back off with Lil Jason.

414
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,720
 Jen changed the name.

415
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,040
 Lil Jason being born into this world, and it was the same thing.

416
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,080
 It was actually the idea of them devolving to a merchant class.

417
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,360
 That came out of the second version.

418
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,200
 The original version, I think they were just a warlord type class, but there was no reason

419
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,600
 for why they stopped invading.

420
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,200
 Because again, I had the mentality of a 12-year-old, just people did stuff.

421
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
 When I retconned it, everyone had whole new motivations.

422
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
 The characters were far more fleshed out.

423
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,400
 And I've been telling myself that bedtime story again for years.

424
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,440
 It's kind of just a cool saga for me.

425
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,680
 And I can look back and go, "Oh yeah, this is where Book 1 would end.

426
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,360
 This was a perfect ending point where they just wiped out all these pirates and stuff

427
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,520
 like that."

428
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,160
 But going back to my original thing, I've gotten to the point in the story where I've

429
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,960
 kind of hemmed myself in because all of the characters have grown so much.

430
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,920
 And I know where I want the story to go, and sometimes I'll lay down to go to sleep and

431
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,960
 I'm like, "Chapter 27, Book 8."

432
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,640
 And I'll go to tell the story and the characters just stand there.

433
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,120
 Like I can't...

434
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,640
 I've put them in...

435
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,840
 I've set them up to a point where the characters are all at such an impasse with each other

436
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,160
 that they don't do anything.

437
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,720
 So I know that I've put them...

438
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,840
 Because the characters are so...

439
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
 This is what's so bizarre.

440
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:18,200
 The characters are so fully fleshed out that when Sarah and Jason, who are bitter rivals,

441
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,120
 are now face to face, they just stand there.

442
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,840
 It's so fascinating because they have this huge willy or woe-they type relationship.

443
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,000
 You know what's really weird about the story too is you think it would be wish fulfillment,

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,600
 but Jason in the story gets crapped on 10 times more than I ever had in real life.

445
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,040
 It's very bizarre.

446
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,800
 And the Jason in the story is very like, "I have no friends.

447
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,400
 Nobody cares about me.

448
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,560
 If I could, I would leave all of this behind.

449
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 But I can't."

450
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,560
 And in the real world, I'm like, "Dude, everything's awesome.

451
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 It's fascinating."

452
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,000
 I almost feel that I would like to fly a spaceship and blow stuff up, but that fictional character

453
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,360
 would love to sit in a living room and do a podcast and be done with everything else.

454
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,400
 Not a happy-go-lucky person at all.

455
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,600
 It's very bizarre that that's the fictional...

456
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,760
 That's my Mary Sue.

457
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,320
 It's someone who's miserable all the time, even though surrounded by all this sci-fi

458
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 technology.

459
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
 But yeah, they'll just sit.

460
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,240
 I'm at this point in the story where they're actually sitting on a balcony and I've been

461
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,040
 stuck in that part of the story for probably like two or three months.

462
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,360
 And I thought, "Should I retcon it again?"

463
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,960
 And I was like, "No, there has to be an ending to this story."

464
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,560
 So to go to Doug's point, like, is it, is somewhere out there in the galaxy these characters

465
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,880
 sitting on a balcony?

466
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,560
 Like am I channeling this?

467
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,040
 Which I don't really believe that.

468
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,680
 But that's a feasible answer for the whole thing.

469
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,240
 Are you channeling these fictional worlds?

470
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,760
 Or are they just so well-crafted that when you're trying to get a character to do something

471
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,420
 out of it, like Jason would never do something completely immoral.

472
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,520
 So if I ever wanted the character to do something like that, the character would simply freeze.

473
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,040
 Jason has blown up, blew up solar system once to win a battle and killed like three billion

474
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
 people.

475
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 But didn't mean to.

476
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,080
 I was just trying to create a black hole to stop a fleet.

477
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,200
 There was just having to be a planet in the way.

478
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,160
 But if the character was like, "I don't care, I'll kill everyone on that planet just to

479
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,440
 stop this fleet," that part of the story wanted to happen.

480
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,040
 It's fascinating.

481
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,680
 The idea of creating things is fascinating.

482
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,680
 So I get that idea.

483
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,520
 But there have been, I'm very, very reluctant to kill off characters in my stories too.

484
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
 There's a spoiler alert.

485
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,480
 If you ever buy a book written by me, don't expect anyone to die.

486
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,980
 Because I do have this weird empathetic thing where I'm like, "If I kill this character

487
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,880
 off, their story ends."

488
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,960
 If I kill off Sarah, or if I kill off Emily, or if I kill off Cleof, or if I kill off Rebecca,

489
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,840
 or any of these other characters in this story, then they're gone.

490
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,880
 Even in the fictional universe, when they die, they just kind of go to the southern dimension

491
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 and they chill.

492
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,000
 Because I hate the idea of losing people.

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So even in my own, I can't accept death, even of fictional characters.

494
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,840
 But I get the allure of believing that fiction is real.

495
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,360
 I don't believe that the screen are real.

496
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
 I hope they're not.

497
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
 They're actually quite brutal.

498
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,720
 They destroy planets, the great black holes, to win battles.

499
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,680
 But yeah, it's just fascinating.

500
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,080
 It's a fascinating story.

501
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,680
 It's tragic that it's wrapped up in the story of Chris Chan, which again is just a mentally

502
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,840
 ill person who's being abused by hundreds and possibly thousands of people on the internet.

503
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,720
 Because that's just kind of sad.

504
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,840
 And of course I can't bring it back to that.

505
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
 That's the story of the dimensional merge.

506
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,600
 I'm sure that came off super rambly.

507
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,040
 I'm sure that came off super rambly.

508
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,200
 But I wanted to tell those stories.

509
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 I wanted to talk about the dimensional merge because I said I was going to talk about it.

510
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,520
 And I wanted to tell those really cool stories about artists meeting their own characters.

511
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 That's kind of bizarre.

512
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,400
 And I wanted to talk about this.

513
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,040
 And I wanted to talk about this.

514
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
 Episode 300.

515
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,720
 300 episodes, guys.

516
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,000
 That's longer than a lot of sitcoms have lasted.

517
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,840
 Now I know a lot more work goes into sitcoms or television in general.

518
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:20,600
 But 300 episodes, I'm never one to not say I'm proud to do it.

519
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,240
 I mean, I know that comes off as boastful.

520
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,760
 But couldn't have done it without you guys.

521
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 Really couldn't have done it without you guys.

522
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,560
 I don't think you, I don't know if you guys really can understand how much this show has

523
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,760
 changed my life.

524
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,200
 Like doing this show has given me so much joy.

525
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,840
 It gets tiring sometimes.

526
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
 But never frustrating.

527
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,960
 I'm never mad.

528
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,360
 Never upset I have to record an episode.

529
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,040
 Sometimes I feel like I am tired.

530
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,000
 But I do it.

531
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,160
 And I enjoy it.

532
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,760
 I enjoy the research.

533
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,120
 I enjoy presenting the stories.

534
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,360
 I wish I was a more ahead on my research.

535
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,600
 That's probably my biggest regret with this show is the day-to-day struggle sometimes

536
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,720
 to find the stories.

537
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 But that's a Jason thing.

538
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,000
 If I had spent, if I spent more time, I haven't been playing Minecraft recently because I've

539
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,520
 been focusing more on doing the research.

540
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
 I need to have a dedicated time to do Minecraft.

541
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,920
 But anyway, that's dedicated time to Minecraft.

542
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,800
 But I need, once I get, when I have a good week when all my stories are ready to go.

543
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,080
 When I have all my stories researched and ready to go.

544
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,240
 That's where I really enjoy.

545
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,760
 But I don't think you guys, I don't think I've ever really imparted on you guys how important

546
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,040
 this show is to me.

547
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,280
 And how important you guys are to me.

548
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,640
 Because it's a community.

549
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,120
 It's amazing.

550
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,120
 Like before I started doing the show, and I talked about this, I think on my Christmas

551
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,880
 episode last year, that I was just kind of walking.

552
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
 I wasn't happy through life.

553
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
 I was just kind of moving through life.

554
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,280
 And I was trying to be an author, and I wasn't putting out as much stuff as I needed to,

555
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,480
 to be a successful author.

556
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,120
 And I started this podcast on a whim.

557
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
 Wasn't really planned.

558
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,480
 I kind of had it in the back of my mind.

559
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,440
 And I just went home one day and recorded the first episode.

560
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,800
 Volcanoes and Talking Critters.

561
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,240
 And here we are, 300 episodes later.

562
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
 Still doing it.

563
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,040
 But I don't want to take this time to just brag about the show.

564
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,080
 Or to brag about you.

565
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,640
 The great fans you are.

566
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,360
 Because you guys are really awesome.

567
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
 You guys are really great.

568
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
 The interaction.

569
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,320
 I know I don't respond to emails super fast, so I apologize for that.

570
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,840
 But I do read them all.

571
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
 I read all the emails.

572
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,400
 You guys are awesome.

573
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,920
 You guys are great.

574
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:40,200
 And I want to challenge you guys.

575
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,080
 300 episodes.

576
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,280
 That's about 70 some odd weeks.

577
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,680
 Because I take a week off every 50 episodes.

578
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,800
 70 weeks, roughly.

579
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,160
 If you had asked me 70 weeks ago, "Hey man, you think you're going to do a podcast that's

580
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,800
 going to have a ton of listeners, people sending you in fan art, people talking to you all

581
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,480
 the time, sending you stories, sending you words of support."

582
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
 And I'd be like, "What are you talking about?

583
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 Get out of my way.

584
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
 I'm walking home.

585
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,600
 I'm walking home to sit and watch YouTube videos for six hours and then be sad that I

586
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,440
 didn't accomplish anything that day."

587
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,600
 But here we are.

588
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,840
 Where will you be in 70 weeks?

589
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,240
 I know where I'm going to be in 70 weeks.

590
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,520
 Episode 600.

591
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,200
 Barring any sort of huge catastrophe?

592
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
 Episode 600.

593
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,960
 I do not plan on quitting the show unless absolute tragedy strikes.

594
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
 Episode 600.

595
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,520
 That's where we're going to be in 70 weeks.

596
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,480
 And 70 weeks from now, I want you there with me.

597
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,800
 Not just a listener of the show.

598
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:47,760
 I want you 70 weeks from now to be 70 weeks more advanced in what you want to do.

599
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:56,640
 I want you to take this next 70 weeks, these next 300 episodes, to push yourself to become

600
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,720
 the better you.

601
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,520
 I'm the better me than I was July 2019.

602
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 That was this year.

603
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
 Never mind.

604
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,760
 I'm a better self now than I was in July 2018.

605
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
 Absolutely.

606
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,240
 I feel better.

607
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
 I feel more alive.

608
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,520
 I have a passion that is shared with others.

609
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,960
 And I want you to have that feeling too.

610
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
 It might not be anything super dramatic.

611
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,480
 It might not be that you've written a novel, but it may.

612
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,640
 It may not be that you've started a podcast, but it may.

613
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,200
 It may be something simple, but something that you know you need to do.

614
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 Do it.

615
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,240
 Take this time period and take this journey with me and do it.

616
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,160
 Those 70 weeks are going to pass whether or not you work towards your goal.

617
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,240
 That's just the way time is.

618
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,440
 But you can either look back when the 600th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio comes out and

619
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,880
 you can say, "You know what?

620
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
 I went on a journey.

621
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,600
 I stumbled a couple of times, but I went on a journey and I'm a better person now than

622
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,840
 when I heard episode 300."

623
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,800
 You can kick back, smile on your face, and look at those past weeks and know you took

624
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
 that journey with me.

625
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,280
 Or you cannot.

626
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,280
 But those 70 weeks will pass whether or not you work towards what you want or you do

627
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,400
 nothing.

628
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,600
 But take this journey with me, please.

629
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,720
 I know, and it's really funny to admit this, but I know that this show is passive entertainment.

630
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,800
 A lot of you guys listen to the show while you are doing something else, driving or writing

631
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
 or drawing or doing homework.

632
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,440
 And I actually find that hilarious and fascinating because the amount of work I put into the

633
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,080
 show and then people are listening to it as they're driving, I don't mind being in passive

634
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
 entertainment.

635
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,120
 I love white noise.

636
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,280
 I love passive entertainment myself.

637
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,720
 When I listen to podcasts, I'm listening to them, but I'm always doing something else.

638
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,200
 You can't really do that when you're reading or drawing or that's main entertainment.

639
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,080
 I like being passive entertainment.

640
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,840
 So let me be that passive entertainment on your journey.

641
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,160
 Or not, you can listen to anything else.

642
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
 You can listen to other podcasts.

643
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,080
 We're alive or Wolverine the Long Night.

644
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,400
 There's tons of other podcasts out there.

645
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 Recommend both of those.

646
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,480
 But let's go on this journey.

647
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,320
 Let's take this path.

648
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,440
 Because I don't know about you, but this next year for me is going to be the best one yet.

649
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,240
 I know that for a fact.

650
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,360
 So I want you to be on that journey with me.

651
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,560
 As far as I'm concerned, this next year is my best year ever.

652
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,840
 And then the next one will be even better than that.

653
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,520
 But this next year is the start of that.

654
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,160
 I don't care what the Chinese say.

655
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,200
 This next year is the year of the rabbit.

656
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,080

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

661
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,040
 But I'm so, so glad you listened to it today.

662
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
 Have a great one guys.
