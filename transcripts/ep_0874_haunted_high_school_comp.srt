1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 A mother and a father fight over a newborn baby.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,400
 This isn't any normal custody battle.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,560
 The father's fighting to save the baby from the mother who believes that that newborn

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,080
 child will destroy the planet.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,560
 And then we travel to Arizona to kick off Arizona Ghost Week, where we visit a local

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,320
 high school with a bizarre legend.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Is there any truth to the story that if a girl is left alone in the Aniston High School

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:41,200
 locker room, she will be assaulted by a pervert from beyond the grave today on Dead Rabbit

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 Radio?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:52,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,880
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,840
 I hope you guys had a fun weekend.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,040
 One last reminder before the event this weekend, May 14th, 2022.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,160
 If you're listening to this episode in the year 2025, it's too late.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,240
 May 14th, 2022, I will be at the McMinniman's UFO Festival in McMinnville, Oregon.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,960
 I will be there from 10 to 6 p.m. with my haunted museum.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,840
 What I tell people about this, they keep saying it's going to look like a garage sale, Jason.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,000
 It might, but it'll be a haunted garage sale.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,560
 And so come out and check it out.

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
 We're going to be sitting there.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
 We're going to be handing out stickers and putting on puppet shows between one, two,

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,080
 and a on-course show at 2.30.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
 That's not true.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,240
 Don't come out if you actually think I'm going to do a puppet show.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
 But I might.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 I probably won't.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,120
 It'll probably look janky enough me sitting there with my garage sale/museum.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,800
 But someone who never looks janky, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, is one

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,560
 of our supporters of the show.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,320
 I'm going to give it up for Nathaniel Williams.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 Woo!

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
 Yeah, yeah.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
 We'll give him a big round of applause as he's walking in.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
 And he's walking in.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,200
 He actually bought me two books.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
 So I'm going to spread his shout out over two episodes.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,880
 He bought me some books off of my Amazon wish list.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 Nathaniel, thank you so much for that.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,760
 In this first episode, he's getting a shout out for is he bought me this book.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
 Everything is under control.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,600
 Conspiracy's Colts and Cover-Ups.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
 Thank you very much for this book.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,400
 This book's written by Robert Anton Wilson.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
 You know anything about conspiracy theories.

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,160
 You know that name.

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,880
 The reason why the name Illuminati means so much in Western society is because of Robert

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,520
 Anton Wilson and his Illuminati trilogy.

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,040
 It was a real group back in the 1700s, but he popularized it.

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
 And this is an encyclopedia of conspiracy theories.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,880
 I spent probably 20 minutes flipping through this the other day.

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,680
 I found an iceberg topic that I covered a long time ago.

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,920
 And I was wrong.

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
 I was wrong.

55
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
 This book is so comprehensive.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
 I've barely scratched the surface.

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
 We're going to have to do an update of an iceberg episode.

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,520
 Paleolithic Deep State is listed in this book.

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,360
 And I'm wondering, because this book is older, I'm wondering how many other iceberg topics

60
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,040
 could be in here.

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,160
 Fascinating book.

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,400
 Thank you so much Nathaniel for sending that over.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,120
 You'll get a shout out when we do that Paleolithic Deep State cover up as well.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,680
 Yeah, 1998 is when that book came out.

65
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,880
 So it definitely predates the icebergs by a long time.

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,640
 So that is a great introduction.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,400
 Nathaniel, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hovercraft.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,440
 This is one of our vehicles that's kind of dusty.

69
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 We don't use a lot.

70
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 Let's all hop on board.

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,320
 Nathaniel fired this bad boy up.

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,200
 We're headed all the way out to Prim, Nevada.

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
 I came across this story the other day.

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,160
 I do a lot of true crime on my TikTok channel @deadrabbitradio.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 That's where I really get my true crime fix.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,720
 I don't cover as much on the show a lot.

77
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,560
 But every so often I come across one that's just so insane that you just gotta spend a

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
 little more time talking about it than just a minute.

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,800
 We're in Prim, Nevada and this just happened on March 26, 2022.

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,040
 There's this woman named Ashley Hollingsworth.

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,720
 She's 23 years old and she's nine months pregnant.

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,320
 And her boyfriend who does not give his name, he just don't want to be associated with this

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,080
 woman at all at this point.

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,640
 He's probably deeply embarrassed.

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,960
 We're gonna call him Mark.

86
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,760
 They're over at a relative of his house.

87
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,440
 They're staying at a relative's of Mark's.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,880
 And it's just them two in the house.

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,240
 Well, baby makes three, right?

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,280
 She's nine months pregnant.

91
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,720
 This little baby person's getting ready to pop out.

92
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,760
 And it's probably been a super stressful nine months, right?

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,920
 I've never gotten anyone pregnant and I can't imagine what it would be like to spend nine

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 months with someone constantly waddling around the house.

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,880
 Otherwise I'd hang out with the penguin.

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,320
 But on this particular day, I don't know how much of this, I don't know how much of

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 there was a lead up to this, but according to Mark, or according to the news articles

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,440
 on this, because this is a true crime case, seems like it may be.

99
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,840
 It just started this day.

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,360
 She's waddling around the living room with this baby inside of her and she goes, "Hey,

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,720
 Mark, Mark, can you do me a favor?"

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,360
 And he's like, "What, what am I gonna go like to the store and get some pickles or something

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 for you?"

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
 She's like, "No, no, don't have it.

105
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
 You mentioned it.

106
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
 I would like some pickles."

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
 No, Mark, will you punch me in the face?

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,520
 Can you start punching me in the face right now?

109
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
 He says, "I'm not gonna punch you in the face."

110
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,280
 So she's like, "Come on, please.

111
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 Pretty please."

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 And he won't do it.

113
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
 So just from the get go, Mark's a pretty standup.

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,320
 Mark is not a man who punches people in the face.

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
 He's a standup guy.

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
 And she's begging him to do it and he's like, "No, I'm not gonna punch you in the face.

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 What is going on?

118
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
 Why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?"

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,320
 She then starts punching herself in the face and then looks at him and says, "I'm ready

120
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,640
 to go to heaven."

121
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,360
 Now, your stress level is already super high, right?

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,640
 His baby is gonna come out of this girl at any moment.

123
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,280
 But I can't imagine the fear of your sitting there with a woman and she starts punching

124
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 herself in the face.

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,040
 Because you know what every one of the world's going to think, including the police officers

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,880
 who come to arrest you.

127
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,720
 They're not gonna believe you if you say, "Well, she's punched herself in the face."

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,920
 So I'm sure Mark was on super edge, but for whatever reason, he didn't immediately freak

129
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
 out.

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
 He just sat there, kept reading a magazine or playing video games.

131
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,520
 A couple hours later, Mark's sitting there and he's like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum.

132
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,760
 You know what's going on with my partially insane girlfriend?"

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
 And she's nine months pregnant.

134
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 I should go check on her.

135
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,640
 So he goes and he goes into the bathroom and there's a baby in the toilet.

136
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,880
 Whoa, not just a baby.

137
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,040
 His baby.

138
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,680
 His baby's in the toilet.

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
 He's like, "Oh my God, what?

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
 Did you give birth while you were in here?"

141
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,720
 And she's just like looking away from him in the corner, just going, "Uh, uh, not the

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,120
 baby, not the baby.

143
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
 Ashley is acting super weird."

144
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,600
 And yes, she went into the bathroom and pushed out a baby.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,400
 Pretty silently, I'll say, because he didn't hear anything.

146
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,120
 So he wraps the baby.

147
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,360
 Baby's totally fine.

148
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,920
 He gets a little towel, hopefully a little soft towel with ducks on it.

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,520
 He wraps the baby up and he's like, "Dude, we got to go to the hospital right now.

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,640
 Like this baby, I don't know much about babies.

151
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,840
 This is my first one, but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to be born in toilets."

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,160
 He gets the baby and they're running out to the car and she's like, "Oh, can I hold

153
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 the baby?

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,800
 You know, mom knows best."

155
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure.

156
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 Gives her the baby."

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 I'm okay.

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,200
 So Mark does the right things in this story, but he does make some bad decisions.

159
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,360
 He gives the baby back to Ashley and they both get in the car and he's driving down

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,200
 the road to the hospital.

161
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:34,160
 And Ashley is looking at the baby and then she starts going, "You're a little devil,

162
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
 aren't you?

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 You're a little devil, baby.

164
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,560
 You're looking at you.

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
 Look at you with your dark thoughts.

166
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,080
 Look at you with your intention to destroy humanity."

167
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,640
 And she begins to try to suffocate the baby.

168
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,680
 Mark's driving this car, right?

169
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,880
 There's a toilet baby in the passenger seat with this crazy mom and he looks over and

170
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,640
 Ashley keeps putting like the towel, the blanket actually is what they got.

171
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,960
 I looked at my notes.

172
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
 I looked a little closer at my notes.

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 It wasn't a towel.

174
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,080
 It wasn't a coarse towel that they picked up off the bathroom floor.

175
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,240
 She keeps taking the towel and she's putting it over the baby's mouth and then she would

176
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,040
 take it off and then she would put it over the baby's mouth.

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,600
 Baby's mouth and no, she's trying to suffocate the baby and she starts saying, "This baby's

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 grunting at me.

179
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 This baby's the devil.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
 I have to kill it."

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
 Mark's driving a car, right?

182
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,280
 And now Mark is like, "Stop it.

183
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 Stop it."

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,720
 He's like trying to get the blanket off the baby's face and she keeps doing this.

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,120
 This baby is like four minutes old at this point.

186
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,760
 I guess you mean what's the way off of it is a three-year-old, but this baby's like four

187
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
 minutes old.

188
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,320
 He then has to fight for the baby.

189
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,160
 He grabs it from his girlfriend and now in one arm, he's holding a four-minute-old toilet

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,520
 baby and then the other arm, he's speeding through traffic trying to get to the hospital.

191
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,760
 And she keeps going, "No, Mark.

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 You don't understand.

193
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,000
 This baby is evil.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
 Look at the way it sticks its tongue out.

195
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
 Look at the way it's grunting at me."

196
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 It's going, "Ehh.

197
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 Ehh.

198
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 Ehh."

199
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,040
 Which I don't know, I've never been around a newborn baby, but I don't think babies are

200
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,720
 in control of what they say or where their tongue is.

201
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,100
 She keeps saying, "This baby is going to get into our brains and she's going to make us

202
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,640
 kill each other."

203
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,200
 That child, we have to kill it.

204
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 We have to kill it.

205
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,800
 It will destroy the world, Mark.

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
 Please, give me back the baby.

207
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,040
 I'll take care of it."

208
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
 Mark's like, "No.

209
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,440
 I'm just going to keep driving the car.

210
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,120
 This baby can grunt at you all that it wants."

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
 And she keeps arguing, "Have you ever seen a baby come out clean before?

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,680
 Like when I gave birth, it wasn't covered in any sort of like weird gross stuff that

213
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 comes out of people.

214
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
 It was just clean.

215
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,200
 Now, to be fair, it did fall on a toilet.

216
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,920
 So maybe they washed some of it away and he's driving the car.

217
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,400
 He's holding this couple-minute-old baby and he gets to the hospital.

218
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,480
 And when they get to the hospital, they're like getting out and the hospital staff kind

219
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 of sees what's going on.

220
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
 This car peels in.

221
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
 He's busting donuts.

222
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,920
 He's like, "Out of the way, ambulances."

223
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,480
 He's warding them off.

224
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 He pulls up.

225
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,120
 This guy jumps out with this little baby and then Ashley gets out of the car and she's

226
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,640
 covered in blood from the waist down.

227
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,080
 Like she's having some serious hemorrhaging.

228
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,600
 The hospital staff's like, "Oh, what in the world?

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,040
 When the world could possibly be going on?

230
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
 Stay away, ambulances.

231
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,520
 We don't care about your broken arms and stroke victims.

232
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,440
 We want to help this crazy couple."

233
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,440
 Well, Ashley, it looks at the hospital staff and notices that she's bleeding and then Ashley

234
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,200
 just runs away.

235
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,280
 And Mark's sitting there holding this baby.

236
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,120
 He's like, "I'm not going after that woman.

237
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,600
 She's totally nuts."

238
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
 And he goes into the hospital and he starts telling him, "Hey, you got to call the police

239
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
 like this woman.

240
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,280
 She tried killing my baby and I think she's going to hurt herself.

241
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,760
 She's talking about people trying to take over the world and the baby is telepathically

242
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,160
 trying to murder people and stuff like that."

243
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
 The baby's totally fine.

244
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
 They brought the baby in for being a toilet baby.

245
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,080
 The baby is totally fine.

246
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,880
 They said the baby never really lost any oxygen in the water or with the blanket.

247
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,680
 Baby's totally fine.

248
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,320
 But the police are now looking for Ashley and about two hours after this all started,

249
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 they find her.

250
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,400
 They find her in the forest.

251
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,000
 There's like a surrounding forest around this area or a wooded area.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
 I don't know if it's like an enchanted forest of gingerbread houses.

253
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,440
 The cops find her and her face is just totally swollen up.

254
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
 It's totally beat up.

255
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,960
 The cops are like, "Whoa, what happened to you?"

256
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,880
 She goes, "I was walking through the forest.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,160
 It's just normal day, just normal day having toilet babies."

258
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,360
 Then I was taking a walk through this forest and a rock started beating me up.

259
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,560
 Started punching me like a Popeye cartoon and the cops are like, "Great."

260
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,840
 They obviously were super scared of rocks.

261
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,080
 She's all shooting the rocks around.

262
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,400
 "Oh no, I think it's all that moving."

263
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,640
 They're like, "A rock didn't really beat her up, you idiot.

264
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
 Let's bring her back to the hospital."

265
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,040
 She obviously needs to be bleeding and her face is all busted up.

266
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 They take her back to the hospital.

267
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
 The cops are super suspicious.

268
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,000
 He won't turn his back on any rocks.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 There's like a gravel pathway.

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,880
 He's like, "No, it's a trap."

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
 They take her back to the hospital and she's like, "Tell you what, guys.

272
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 I lied.

273
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
 A rock didn't beat me up.

274
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
 I made that up."

275
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,320
 What actually happened was I ran away from my baby because I thought my baby's just going

276
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,040
 to make me murder a bunch of people.

277
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,760
 If I didn't run away quick enough, the baby would start following me.

278
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,160
 I had to run as far away as possible.

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,760
 Once I got out of the baby's telepathic range, I realized what a horrible mother I was.

280
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,360
 I decided to kill myself.

281
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:42,920
 I saw this giant rock and I began smashing my face into the rock 15 times to kill herself.

282
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,640
 Then she's basically completely bloodied.

283
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 She's all bashed up.

284
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,360
 Then she realizes something is preventing her from killing herself.

285
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,880
 Even though she seemed to fall out of this mania where she thought this baby was evil,

286
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
 she had to kill the baby, she got far enough away from it and she was finally like, "Oh,

287
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
 my God.

288
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
 I'm a horrible person.

289
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
 I shouldn't have done that.

290
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
 I have to take my own life."

291
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,240
 She still attributed some sort of psychic or supernatural force to keeping her from

292
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 killing herself.

293
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
 I'm bashing her head in.

294
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,720
 She goes, "Doctors, cops, I can obviously see these psychologists walking into the

295
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,960
 room as well.

296
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,280
 Don't worry," Ashley said.

297
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
 "Don't worry.

298
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,000
 You see, Jesus put good magic on the baby and now the baby's okay.

299
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And I will be okay too.

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I'll be okay."

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,120
 She's spinning up teeth and her head is throbbing.

302
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,400
 There's little birds floating around lumps in her head.

303
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,360
 This is what's interesting about this story.

304
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,160
 Everyone outside the fact that it involves toilet babies and satanic prophecies and Jesus

305
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,080
 magic and all that stuff.

306
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,720
 What's so fascinating about this story is we will never hear about this story again unless

307
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,680
 something really bad happens in the future.

308
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,400
 Like this woman who has two other kids, by the way, I can tell you how this story will

309
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,360
 progress without any of us knowing.

310
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
 She'll stay living with the kids.

311
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,120
 She'll probably get some psychiatric help.

312
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,200
 Whether or not it helps, we won't know.

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,640
 Hopefully it does.

314
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
 But she will stay with the kids.

315
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,880
 Mark may file for sole custody of this child.

316
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 The mom's dangerous.

317
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 She tried murdering it.

318
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,120
 Some Nevada judge will say, "Well, we think that's a little radical."

319
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,840
 Sure, she tried killing her baby multiple times, but let's go ahead and do the co-parenting

320
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,120
 thing and there'll be joint custody.

321
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,360
 I can already predict that will happen.

322
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,120
 And I never hear about these people again.

323
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,680
 I hope Ashley Hutchinson just becomes a name on this episode.

324
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,520
 Or sorry, that doesn't exist.

325
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 Ashley Hollingsworth.

326
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
 Hopefully I never hear about these people again.

327
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
 That means her life was fairly normal.

328
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,760
 If these people pop up again, it's because she murdered her child or some bizarre murder

329
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,320
 suicide thing, which could happen in a week.

330
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,120
 It could happen 10 years from now when her daughter's getting ready to do the school play

331
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,320
 and Ashley Hollingsworth has another mental breakdown and kills her kid before she can

332
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
 go on stage and says if she had gone on stage, she would have been able to influence the

333
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
 entire PTA and I stopped that.

334
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,200
 I saved the world.

335
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,680
 This is one of those stories that the only way we'll ever have a follow-up is if it's

336
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
 completely tragic.

337
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,060
 So I hope I never hear about these people again.

338
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:29,080
 I hope they live long lives, but if I was that boyfriend and now that dad of that kid,

339
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,400
 there is no way I would let her near that kid ever.

340
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,360
 But when I read all this true crime stuff, all this true crime stuff, judges are constantly

341
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,560
 picking their nose and not paying attention and then going joint custody and then something

342
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,120
 awful, absolutely awful happens.

343
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
 So again, I hope I never hear about this family again.

344
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,040
 It's a funny story because the baby survived.

345
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,080
 If this story ended with the baby dying, I probably wouldn't have had, I definitely wouldn't

346
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,880
 have had as much fun telling it.

347
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 You have a crazy lady mixed with that paranormal fanaticism, right?

348
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,720
 We all enjoy the paranormal, we talk about the paranormal and some of us believe it more

349
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,160
 than others, but when you let it, here's a tip.

350
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
 It's okay to believe in the paranormal, it's okay to engage in the paranormal, but if the

351
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,600
 paranormal ever tells you to kill your baby, you've gone too far.

352
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,400
 That's when you know that it's time to stop.

353
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,880
 So Ashley, take those words of wisdom hopefully and don't do this in your bad mom if you try

354
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,160
 killing your baby or anyone really.

355
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,560
 Fascinating though story.

356
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,760
 Would you feel comfortable living?

357
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,600
 Would you feel comfortable falling asleep next to that one?

358
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,480
 Let alone your kid, your defenseless kid in a little crib and you're like, well I gotta

359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
 go to work, I'm headed on down to the shoe factory.

360
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,760
 I couldn't do it.

361
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 I couldn't do it.

362
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,240
 Plus the shoe factory is not hiring.

363
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
 I've always wanted that job.

364
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
 Crazy, crazy story.

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,320
 Nathaniel, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

366
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,200
 We're gonna leave behind Prim Nevada.

367
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,120
 We're headed a little south all the way down to, wait, did I say this was haunted Arizona

368
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
 week?

369
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
 I think I did.

370
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,960
 Nathaniel, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

371
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,680
 We're leaving behind Prim Nevada.

372
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,480
 We're headed all the way out to Aniston, Alabama.

373
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:24,200
 I think in the intro I said this was haunted Arizona.

374
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
 haunted Arizona week.

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,400
 Let's say it's haunted states that start with a week.

376
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
 I actually thought this story took place in Arizona.

377
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 It takes place in Alabama.

378
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,200
 I gotta be honest with you guys.

379
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,080
 I wanna be honest with you guys.

380
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
 Recently I did an episode and I'll put it in the show notes.

381
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,800
 It was about a ghost hunter saying that the ghost in Britain seemed to be drying up.

382
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,680
 That there were less reported hauntings over the past year or two.

383
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,200
 And even in very famous haunted locations, it seems like the ghostly activity was drying

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
 up.

385
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 We did an episode on it.

386
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 It was really interesting.

387
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,160
 I'll be honest, these past three weeks, this week included, I've had a very hard time finding

388
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,880
 new paranormal stories.

389
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
 I've been having to go back.

390
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,920
 I've been having to go through these huge indexes I have.

391
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,000
 Think about it, docs.com and the shadow lands and stuff like that.

392
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,600
 Looking at these huge...

393
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,760
 Something is happening in the world of the paranormal.

394
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,560
 I don't know what it is.

395
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:29,040
 It used to be every week I would find maybe 15, 20 stories that I could cover and I would

396
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,280
 boil it down to 10, like my cup runneth over with new paranormal stuff, stuff that's happening

397
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,600
 right now.

398
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,680
 And the past three weeks, something is going on in the world of the paranormal.

399
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,080
 I don't know what it is.

400
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,840
 We covered it when the guy in Britain did this.

401
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
 Where are the ghosts going?

402
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,720
 It does seem like something's happening.

403
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,120
 I don't know what's happening though.

404
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 So I was...

405
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,640
 I'm doing a lot of ghost stuff this week and I thought I was doing this Arizona ghost thing

406
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,040
 but the story takes place in Alabama and I've actually had to be going through these indexes.

407
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,360
 These are my reservoirs.

408
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,560
 If no other paranormal stories pop up, I still have enough material for about 800 more episodes,

409
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,880
 I would say 900 more episodes.

410
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,160
 But obviously you don't want to constantly be retrieving from the well.

411
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,360
 You do want some cutting edge paranormal stuff.

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
 You want to mix it up, right?

413
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
 You want to mix it up.

414
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,160
 I don't know what this phenomenon is or maybe it's just a natural slump.

415
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
 I haven't...

416
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,120
 In my four years now of doing this show, I haven't experienced something like this.

417
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
 So this is weird.

418
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,000
 I wanted to make a note of that.

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But anyways, we're pulling up to Aniston, Alabama.

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
 The year's 2001.

421
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,040
 Specifically we're headed out to Aniston High School.

422
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,160
 And at this school, at Aniston High School, there's an urban legend that all the freshman

423
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,000
 girls that are starting school are told this story.

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,560
 I don't know if this is the official thing.

425
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,360
 I don't know if the principal sits down with them and holds a flashlight up to his face

426
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,520
 and goes, "Now girls, listen, I don't know if it's that or if it's just other classmates

427
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
 telling them."

428
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,720
 But apparently this story has been going on.

429
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,200
 It's been passed down from generation to generation.

430
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 So here's the story.

431
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,320
 Here's the story that the high school girls at Aniston High School are told in summary,

432
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
 right?

433
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,800
 There was a young girl named Nancy and she always loved going to the PE locker room.

434
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,640
 She was the first person there.

435
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,080
 She was the first person to leave.

436
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 She's very punctual.

437
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,440
 And the reason why she wanted to be the first person to leave is so she could get to the

438
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,840
 bus on time and take the bus home.

439
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,800
 And then she's probably the first person to show up at home.

440
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
 She's a latchkey kid.

441
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,760
 And she walks in, she makes herself some macaroni and cheese.

442
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,320
 But this particular day, Nancy is there with her friend Betty.

443
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
 And they're both in the locker room.

444
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,560
 And Nancy is not able to get everything done as quickly as possible.

445
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,240
 And she's like, "Oh no, what am I supposed to do next?"

446
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,840
 "Put on my clothes or do I take a shower?"

447
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,480
 "I don't remember this for whatever reason."

448
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
 She doesn't remember the order of how to ready herself.

449
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
 She's going slow and Betty's like, "Nancy, come on, come on, you gotta hurry up.

450
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,760
 You're gonna miss the bus."

451
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,840
 Again, completely uncharacteristic for Nancy, but she can't get her stuff together.

452
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
 So Nancy's finally ready to go.

453
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,400
 Finally ready to go.

454
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,800
 Her and Betty jump up, they leave the gym and as they're walking to the bus, Nancy goes,

455
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,400
 "Oh my God, I forgot my purse in the locker room."

456
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
 And Betty's like, "Dude, listen.

457
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 Don't grab your purse.

458
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 I'll try to hold the bus."

459
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,880
 But if you get your stuff together, you're normally like the most prompt.

460
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,520
 I know, I know, I don't know what's going on.

461
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,160
 So Betty goes to the bus and Nancy goes back to the locker room and she is all alone in

462
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 there.

463
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,040
 She's just walking through the locker room to get her purse.

464
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,000
 She will be out of here in a minute.

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,720
 But that's when she hears the door to the locker room open and close.

466
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,560
 That's the door like kind of swiveling back and forth.

467
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,400
 And she goes, "Coach, coach, or Tim the Toolman Taylor, whoever made that noise.

468
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
 Coach, don't lock up.

469
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
 I'm still in here.

470
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 I'm just grabbing my purse."

471
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 Purse, purse.

472
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,480
 Her voice echoes through the empty locker room.

473
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,000
 She's like, "Oh man, super spooky in here all by myself.

474
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,080
 I've never been here all by myself, even though it's taken earlier that I show up.

475
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
 I'm the first one here.

476
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
 Forget that detail.

477
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,760
 I've never been here this late by myself."

478
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
 I meant to say.

479
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,600
 She begins to hear the sound of feet walking towards her.

480
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,120
 Sound of heavy footsteps.

481
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
 She goes, "That's weird.

482
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
 That sounds like a sound.

483
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,560
 That sounds like a sound of a man slapping his sweaty thighs in a haunted closet."

484
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,440
 Or the sound of feet.

485
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,920
 But that doesn't sound like my coach's feet.

486
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,600
 He definitely doesn't sound like a sweaty thigh.

487
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,560
 Coach, coach, coach.

488
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,200
 No one responds, but she clearly hears someone else walking through the PE room.

489
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,200
 And then she hears right behind her, or she feels would be more apt.

490
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,680
 She feels warm breath right on her neck.

491
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,600
 So at that point she realizes this isn't the coach.

492
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,960
 And just then she feels these strong hands wrap around her.

493
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
 And there's this, now she's in the fight for her life.

494
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,960
 She's fighting with this total stranger.

495
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
 She's never seen this guy before.

496
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,720
 He's this big, brutish man.

497
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,360
 And he's completely overpowering her.

498
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,960
 He within seconds is in the power position in this fight.

499
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
 And she's screaming for help.

500
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
 She's hoping someone can hear her.

501
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,560
 Maybe the coach is walking by.

502
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,720
 Maybe Betty also left her person here.

503
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 Someone has to hear her.

504
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,800
 She's screaming for help.

505
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,600
 And this maniac, I don't want to get into too many details, but this maniac begins ripping

506
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,960
 her clothes off.

507
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,240
 So I think we can imply what this maniac wants.

508
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
 This isn't just a regular serial killer.

509
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,160
 He's also a perverted dude.

510
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,680
 And he's screaming at her to just shut up, shut up, and she won't shut up.

511
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,000
 So he begins strangling her.

512
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:54,480
 And in her last moments of consciousness, she reaches up and she grabs onto one of the

513
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,080
 lockers and pulls it down on this dude.

514
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
 He's like, "Ah, he's like empty lockers.

515
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,200
 My only weakness."

516
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
 And the lockers smash into him and he falls off of her.

517
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,720
 And then he's like, "No, no."

518
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,880
 And he falls on the ground and the lockers squishes head open.

519
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,760
 There's just blood everywhere.

520
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,880
 And Nancy scrambles to her feet and runs out of the locker room.

521
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,160
 The bus is gone.

522
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,080
 She's sitting there and her clothes are tattered.

523
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,480
 And she goes to a pay phone.

524
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
 She calls her mom.

525
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
 The mom calls the police.

526
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,560
 They go there.

527
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,200
 And when the police get there, they walk into the locker room, guns drawn.

528
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,840
 They see the lockers knocked over.

529
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,120
 They see Nancy's purse.

530
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,680
 And they see a pool of blood.

531
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,520
 But they don't find a body.

532
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,400
 This story has apparently been going around since 2001.

533
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,120
 And there's two additions to it.

534
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,480
 One is the story has now become, a young girl should not be alone in the PE locker

535
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,120
 room at Aniston High School.

536
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,800
 Because if you are alone, just the one of you, you will hear the sound of a door opening,

537
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,880
 the sound of heavy footsteps walking towards you and the sensation of someone breathing

538
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 on the back of your neck.

539
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,960
 But when you turn around, there's no one there.

540
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,440
 So classic haunting, classic ghostly activity.

541
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,920
 And then there's another addition to the story.

542
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,680
 People were telling this story every year since 2001.

543
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,400
 And no one really believed it or some people believed it thought it was spooky.

544
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,680
 Until one night, there was another girl who she was there.

545
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,800
 She was supposed to be in the band.

546
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,000
 She was part of the band and they were going to perform at the football game that night,

547
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,320
 the home game.

548
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,920
 And this young girl, she stayed behind in the locker room to do some changing.

549
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,520
 She had to get her big fuzzy hat, switch it out for, I don't know, a small fuzzy hat.

550
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,240
 And she never showed up for the band.

551
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,800
 She'd like, they did the whole performance.

552
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,760
 And they didn't know where this girl was.

553
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,560
 And then after the football game, and as the band was filing out of the auditorium, the

554
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:10,400
 stadium, I meant, they see their fellow band member sitting there on the corner, her clothes

555
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,960
 and tatters, and she's crying.

556
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
 And they said, we never saw her again.

557
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,920
 Like she never came back to school.

558
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,120
 Apparently her family moved.

559
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,920
 It does feel like an urban legend and urban legends are always there to teach us a lesson.

560
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,600
 And the lesson in this story is young women don't be alone in a place where you can't

561
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,680
 easily get help.

562
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,440
 I think it's the, but that's, that situation's global.

563
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,000
 That situation's everywhere, right?

564
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,640
 You don't hear stories about don't walk down the street at night because otherwise a ghost

565
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
 might get you.

566
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,360
 Like, why is that this urban legend so specific to this location at this high school?

567
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,240
 Was there an assault on a young girl, a sexual assault on a young girl in this location?

568
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,080
 And instead of telling that story about something that happened between a teacher and a student

569
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,600
 or student and a student, however, worked out a student and a stranger, you wrap it in a

570
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
 ghostly box because it goes down easier.

571
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
 That doesn't seem right.

572
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,920
 That doesn't seem like you could just tell the story like, hey, ladies, don't be alone.

573
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 There's perverts out there, especially in a locker room where we've in the past had perverts

574
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,280
 show up.

575
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,880
 It's also possible that there is a haunting there.

576
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,800
 It's also possible that the, because I've come across this a lot and we're going to be

577
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,920
 talking about this later in the week when we continue our ghost from states that start

578
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,760
 with a special, you have a haunting that at this P.E.

579
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,640
 locker room, there may be the sound of a door opening and footsteps in the warm breath on

580
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,160
 the back of their neck and someone retconned that story for a reason why.

581
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,840
 And then unfortunately the story about the young girl who was in the band, that could

582
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,080
 have been again a totally unrelated event, a unrelated sexual assault as of this story,

583
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,680
 but who knows, right?

584
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,880
 And all of that stuff is really fascinating and that's definitely a path we can travel

585
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 down, but I wanted to actually end this episode by bringing up a conspiracy theory that I

586
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
 talked about a long time ago.

587
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,880
 It's probably one of the most uncomfortable conspiracy theories we've talked about on

588
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,280
 this show.

589
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,880
 And this story reminded me of that.

590
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,360
 I did an episode a long time ago called Scooby Doo SVU and it was about sex offenders and

591
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 their connection to the world of the paranormal.

592
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,280
 And what sparked that episode is I thought, are there, this is a conspiracy theory, which

593
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,960
 now I used to say are there, now I think I started, there are, there are, there has

594
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,760
 to be groups of sexual perverts, pedophiles, rapists, however they are, right?

595
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:48,040
 They're all kind of the same ilk who use magic to attack their victims.

596
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,400
 It has to exist.

597
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,640
 It has to exist because we, the world of paranormal, we believe in magic.

598
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,480
 We believe that people use magic for dark purposes.

599
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,720
 The thing I was specifically saying is, is there a group of pedophiles out there who

600
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,260
 summon the ghost of dead children to molest them?

601
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,160
 And while I was researching that, I found out that there's just a bunch of pedophiles

602
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,200
 involved in the world of the paranormal.

603
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,760
 There's a ton of them.

604
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,040
 Since that episode, one of the guys from one of the East Coast States for Mufon, the mutual

605
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,760
 UFO network, got caught soliciting like a 13 year old or 16 year old or whatever it

606
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 was.

607
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,080
 Like since that episode, and in that episode I'll put in the show notes, it's like example

608
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,240
 after example after example of people using the world of the paranormal to attack victims.

609
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,540
 And the people have to be using this in more darker, well they're both horrible, but people

610
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,100
 have to be using magic to do this stuff.

611
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,020
 I am, I used to say is there and now I would say there is most likely a group of pedophilic

612
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:58,180
 dark magic users who summon the ghost of dead children to molest them.

613
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,840
 It just has to, in all the stuff that we've covered, that seems reasonable.

614
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,480
 I'm not saying the activity seems reasonable, there has to be a group like that.

615
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,320
 And when you can name a group like that and you can't find them, again that as a conspiracy

616
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,680
 theory makes me more, it makes me more certain that that group exists and they're really

617
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,920
 good at covering their tracks.

618
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,120
 If you have all these other groups, you know like the Illuminati, the Trilateral Commission

619
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,440
 or the Bilderberg group, they're all economically powerhouses, right?

620
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,460
 But you also would have, if you were to say if you have a bunch of businessmen wanting

621
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,020
 to control the world of business, you would have perverts going you know what, I'm a super

622
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,080
 perverted guy, I'm a super perverted guy and I really wanted to hook up a Jean Benet but

623
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,060
 she's dead or is she and then they like summon Jean Benet's ghost.

624
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,140
 It has to exist.

625
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,260
 And here's the thing, even if it didn't work, even if it didn't work, people have to be

626
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,380
 trying that.

627
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:02,200
 I would find it absolutely shocking that there's not a single Venn diagram of people who are

628
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,460
 perverts and people who are users of magic or steadiers of magic, even if it didn't work,

629
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,500
 they're trying to use Ouija boards or summoning spells or whatever.

630
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,980
 I'm not saying that Jean Benet's actually showing up in these locations and she's being

631
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
 traumatized.

632
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,500
 I'm saying that people are trying to do that.

633
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
 It has to exist.

634
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,740
 And when I read this story, I thought he might have not even the first time this guy showed

635
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,020
 up that might have been the ghost.

636
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,500
 That might have been the specter.

637
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,180
 She never really got a good look at this dude.

638
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,620
 It was just this big, brutish guy who gets his brain smashed in with a locker and then

639
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
 just disappeared.

640
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,420
 There's no body or anything like that.

641
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,940
 So I'm thinking what if that was also the spirit?

642
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,740
 What if someone is summoning these beings, these ghosts, to kind of wander the world

643
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,860
 and you're basically astrally traveling to be a rapist?

644
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,060
 I mean, rape and all that stuff is scary enough, but like a ghost popping out of your closet

645
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,340
 and doing it is like far more terrifying.

646
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,180
 I think this story reminded me of that.

647
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,880
 I think there is a huge...

648
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,100
 So many stories about ghosts like inappropriately touching women.

649
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,060
 We talked about that in an episode a long time ago.

650
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

651
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,820
 But I think, you know, you can look through any ghost book and they'll talk about, "Oh,

652
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,220
 that ghost is a Randy ghost.

653
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,860
 Still sit there and they'll pinch that woman's butt."

654
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:29,540
 I think that there is a huge crossover between sexual perverts and practitioners, specifically

655
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,020
 of the dark arts, right?

656
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,100
 I don't think a lot of people out there who are doing like healing stone crystals and

657
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,340
 selling them at the fair, I'm not saying that person's a pervert.

658
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,820
 But they could be.

659
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,020
 Who knows?

660
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,700
 I think that there is a crossover.

661
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,820
 And I think the fact that you cannot find a group that does this means that they are

662
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,140
 so well hidden.

663
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,020
 They are so underground.

664
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,260
 I can type in almost any conspiracy theory, the craziest thing you can think of, and you'll

665
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,100
 find some sort of connection behind it.

666
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,540
 But if you try looking up pedophiles who summon the ghost of dead kids, not even on like dark

667
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,380
 web creepypastas does this stuff exist.

668
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,780
 Which makes me think it exists.

669
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:16,860
 And this story reminded me of that, of that crossover between the world of sex perverts

670
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,300
 and the world of the supernatural.

671
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,180
 And I said on that past episode, is there a group of people who engage in black magic

672
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,300
 and molest dead children?

673
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,820
 And now I, after what, it's been two years since I had that episode, I do have to say

674
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:40,100
 yes there is, and the fact that we can't find any proof of this group means either it doesn't

675
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
 exist right?

676
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,460
 That's what skeptic would say, but I think it exists and it's so powerful that they

677
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,020
 just hide it.

678
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,060
 You can't prove it.

679
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,780
 You can't find anything on it.

680
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,300
 It's fascinating and it's disturbing to me.

681
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,060
 This group probably does exist.

682
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,700
 This may be the first time they're being openly accused of existing, I mean again the fact

683
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,180
 that there is nothing, not even in fiction that really talks about this stuff, makes

684
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,140
 me think that there are hidden hands keeping this story from getting out there.

685
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,900
 Now I'm not saying this show is going to get cancelled because it released this episode

686
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,420
 or I'm going to get assassinated or anything like that.

687
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,660
 Because people are just going, "Ah, that's just some weirdo talking in his closet."

688
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,740
 But I think this group exists.

689
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,900
 And I think that there is a huge crossover between this type of disgusting activity in

690
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,580
 the world of the paranormal.

691
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,820
 I guess the question you have to ask yourself is how far are you willing to go to find

692
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,620
 out the truth?

693
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,940
 And for a topic like this, I mean I'm fine just, I'll be honest, I'm fine just thinking

694
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,020
 this might exist.

695
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,620
 Like I don't want to, maybe it's something that I don't want to know for certain that

696
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,860
 exists, that I don't want to stumble across the website.

697
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,660
 It's like some things you may be better off not knowing are real and you just would rather

698
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,540
 just hear this creepy story that they tell in Aniston High School that's vaguely related

699
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,620
 to a conspiracy theory that, like would you, how much would your worldview change if you

700
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:11,780
 knew for certain that there was a group out there trying to do this and how much of your

701
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,620
 worldview would change if you knew they were successful in summoning the spirits of the

702
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,420
 dead to continue to torment them.

703
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:26,660
 Just because some people have access to the right magical tools and a disgusting, sick

704
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:34,940
 perversion, they get to break the laws of reality and continue to torment these children

705
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,300
 after they're dead.

706
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,180
 That sounds so horrifying to even put into words.

707
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,860
 Would you want proof of that?

708
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,000
 Would you want to know for certain when you read these horrible news articles about things

709
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 that happened to these kids?

710
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,900
 You go, well at least their suffering is over.

711
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:09,180
 But what if you knew for certain that their suffering was just beginning?

712
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,620
