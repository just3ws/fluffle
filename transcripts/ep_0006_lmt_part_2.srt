00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
 The world is full of great men who are not recognized for their greatness in their time.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:20,000
 They were once called madmen, but are now hailed as geniuses who saw through the clutter

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,200
 and discovered the truth.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,840
 Welcome to Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:44,560
 [Music]

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:53,200
 Okay, so we are back. We're back for part two of linenmurdertruth.com.

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,960
 That's the website, but the subject matter is the who shot John Linden.

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,600
 I'm obviously, well I'm Jason Carpenter. I'm a little more awake now. I think I have some

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,240
 sort of disease that causes me to be both sleepy and have sore kidneys. At the same time,

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,960
 I've been battling both of those for some bizarre reason.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,240
 I went, I was up till one o'clock last night recording part one, part one of this and you

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,040
 can see that as the previous podcast. And then I had to wake up at eight in the morning to go

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,160
 grocery shopping. It was probably one of the most adult things I've done in quite a while.

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,400
 I have to wake up early. It's been about four or five hours grocery shopping with a good friend

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,560
 of mine. We talked a bit about the podcast. What did we talk about?

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,040
 Uh, here's random stuff. I found out what a bully stick is after holding one.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,320
 It's a bull penis. I thought it was like a walking stick. No, it's probably about three feet long.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,320
 Kind of crazy. I didn't even know there's exist. Well, I knew they existed on bowls, but I didn't

19
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,160
 know it was like a dog chew toy or something like that. So anyways, I got done grocery shopping.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,840
 I tried cauliflower rice for the first time. It was weird. I bought two bags of it. So I'll

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
 have to eat the other bag, but my stomach's not feeling good either. That's kind of bugging me.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,440
 So we're going to go ahead and get on with this podcast on this beautiful sunny day. Then I'm

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
 going to go take a nap. I hope your day is a little more eventful. What we're going to do now

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,200
 is we were going, so we listened to his introduction last time and it seemed fairly rambling. Even

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,640
 when I was listening back to it, I was like, man, this guy's really all over the place. That was

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,320
 him putting forward. That was his best foot forward. That was a Steven Lightfoot, Steve Lightfoot,

27
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:58,560
 laying out his best arguments for what's going on. Now, at the end too, I also said something about

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,320
 being schizophrenic and or having mental illness and seeing connections where there may not be

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,320
 connections. I wasn't trying to imply that Steve Lightfoot suffers from those things. I don't know

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,280
 that is a symptom of that, of different mental illnesses, but I'm not implying that he does,

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
 because I don't know. And honestly, maybe he's right. Weirder things have happened. So we're

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,400
 going to go ahead and we're going to look at his about me section, which honestly is more fascinating

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,000
 than his introduction, because we get to learn who Steven Lightfoot is. So again, I'm just going

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,040
 to go ahead and do a semi dramatic reading of his exact words, because I think his words can

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:51,040
 say more about his arguments that Steven King killed John Lennon and also explain just exactly who

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,120
 Steve Lightfoot is. And I will say this before I get started. I at LennonMurderTruth.com, which is

37
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:08,800
 his website, he sells a magazine, which according to him was referenced by George Bush during the

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:18,640
 Bush Clinton debates back in what would that have been a 92. Was it 92? It was 92. So

39
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,680
 I bought a copy today. It's only $10. I recommend that all of my listeners, new and old,

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,920
 go to LennonMurderTruth.com and buy a copy of his manifesto. There's no other way to put it.

41
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 He's listed like a 25 page magazine, but I guarantee you this I'm not joking. This will be a piece

42
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,360
 of history. It is a $10 investment for a piece of history. You have to understand this gentleman

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,200
 travels the country, mostly on the East and West Coast, but selling these magazines,

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,040
 confronting people and trying to build an army of acolytes to spread this truth,

45
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
 we're never going to have the pleasure of meeting him in real life. If you know what,

46
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
 honestly, if anything this podcast does, I hope it elevates him. But again, completely

47
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,560
 honest, I'm not being facetious. I think it's interesting he's dumped this much time, this

48
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,000
 much passion in a 30 year project. We're never going to meet him in real life. He is basically a

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,080
 living meme that no one's heard of. You can be one of the first people to own a copy of this

50
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,840
 magazine. I can't wait. I placed my order last night. I just got paid last night. I was able to

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,400
 get the web, the web hosting setup for this. I did a bunch of stuff and I ordered his magazine.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,760
 Go to LennonMurderTruth.com. Check it out. Right now I'm going to go ahead and read his

53
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:53,680
 About Me section and I will be back for a little bit of commentary when we're done.

54
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:07,120

 As for the rest of you, thousands sold, no refunds requested. It's the real deal

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 talking about his magazine. If you would like to help me break this story and quadruple your

 investment after I am look, check, take. Okay, so I'm gonna get back into character mode. We're

62
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,880
 gonna do this shape. Here's the rest of it. If you would like to help me break this story and

63
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,440
 quadruple your investment after I am looking for sponsors, I'm even looking for philanthropic people

64
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,440
 who want to get some truth for their money in this life for a change. More details are found on my

65
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 new developments page, the chapter titled I Need Sponsors. My email address is LennonMurderTruth@yahoo.com.

66
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,480
 Regarding what you may or may not have read or heard about me, let me assure you that it is almost

67
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,240
 all jealous hogwash. The government has its army of character assassins who want to scare you off

68
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,920
 of my findings. By mischaracterizing and marginalizing me with untruths and slanted opinions, I am 100%

69
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,800
 pure American hero who discovered hard evidence in Lennon's murder and is brave enough to go public

70
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,040
 with everything until the world knows and Stephen King is jailed for murder. Any other portrayal

71
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:10,800
 of me is designed to scare you off of the truth I have uncovered. At present, 5/19/2015, I'm a 61-year-old

72
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,280
 athletic, young-looking man who knows more about our sick plan than most of all of you do. I gave

73
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,360
 up a dream of playing professional golf after my discovery of government codes and major news

74
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,680
 magazines that linked our government and a horror writer to John Lennon's murder took over my life

75
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,560
 some 33 years ago. The biggest news story since, I'll say it, since Jesus Christ has not been so well

76
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,600
 received by my so-called fellow human being. In fact, I learned that when it comes to grappling

77
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,960
 with our collective crime of killing John Lennon, all of you people act as though I have called

78
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,760
 all of you in Lennon's murder and maybe that is really also the case. A phenomenon of guilt,

79
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,000
 denial, and see no, speak no, and hear no evil on the part of all guilty mankind.

80
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,160
 Even Paul McCartney has been exposed as the fair weather friend and a bag of what's he apparently

81
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,720
 is just like all the celebrity hood and even my own family members who are also hypocrites. Of course,

82
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,160
 Yoko is a government bitch who still babysits the cover up in New York like the Judas cunt

83
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,960
 that she is and the US media is too cowardly to do their job, partly because the CIA has taken

84
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,800
 over our media. Of course, you all may think all of this to be a little too rich and over the top,

85
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:44,960
 but it is not. I am the messenger. Hi, my name is Steve Lightfoot. I was born in Hell in a Montana

86
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,240
 March 1st, 1954, and I was raised in Northern California in a small town called Healdsburg.

87
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,760
 Lightfoot is an English surname, and I am also part Scott, Irish, and Yugoslavian. My father was

88
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
 a doctor and my mother a housewife. I have two brothers and a sister and I had a pretty normal

89
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,000
 upbringing. I attended a private parochial grade school and public high school and two junior

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,520
 colleges. My grades were good and I like baseball and basketball, tennis, and especially golf,

91
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,400
 which became a professional ambition of mine while in my 20s to be a professional golfer.

92
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,040
 This ambition saw me attach myself to restaurant work, cooking, waiting, managing, and I had a

93
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,560
 large number of different jobs as well. It was while back east in Georgia that I found myself

94
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,320
 both playing the bigger amateur events and working. I met a young woman at the time who proved to be

95
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,760
 quite the traumatized liar. When we met she gave me a phony name and passed and lived with me for a

96
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,480
 short time. Many melodramatic events, a breakup, and over a year later I would find out her real

97
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,920
 name passed, etc. This experience made me different from most of you because I was no longer naive

98
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,560
 about liars or lies. I knew intimately how convincing they could be. My golf career peaked,

99
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:15,440
 missing a birth in the US amateur by one shot. During this period I returned to California

100
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,280
 to study golf technique near Monterey. Just as I was crawling my way back to a golf career,

101
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,360
 John Lennon was assassinated and I knew instinctively that the story about a lone drifter was

102
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,000
 government media hogwash. That huge players were behind the murder and that America and all the

103
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,120
 people of the world had just been victimized by evil bastards. Like most of you I assumed they

104
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,400
 would not leave evidence the government rarely does, but when there was no trial for the alleged

105
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,960
 gunman Mark Chapman, I knew almost for certain that indeed the government killed John Lennon.

106
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,800
 He was the hottest political firebrand to threaten the establishment since Gandhi and

107
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,480
 possibly Jesus Christ himself. Richard Nixon tried to illegally deport John

108
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,000
 Law president, but that was at first a hazy fact that needed refreshing. On July 22, 1982,

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,400
 a year and a half after the murder and weeks after seeing the tiny buried clipping about

110
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,040
 Chapman's closed door guilty plea, I decided to reread the murder reports to see how Chapman skipped

111
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,840
 trial. I burst through the library doors sensing drama and a sense of urgency and as I entered

112
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,960
 the room I grabbed a year old copy of Us Magazine that happened to be on the first table I passed.

113
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,880
 It had John and Yoko on the cover. I went to the magazine section and grabbed all the time Newsweek

114
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,760
 and US News and World Report magazines dated December 15, 1980 I could find. Not knowing then

115
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,920
 that those issues were released December 8, the day of the murder. I first read the Us

116
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,360
 magazine article and learned that Nixon tried to illegally deport John in the early 70s because

117
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,960
 of his high political profile in pronouncements against the Vietnam War and Nixon himself.

118
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:12,240
 John invented the term "tricky dick" in fact. I then turned to the issue of time in Newsweek

119
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,760
 and simultaneously noticed there was no murder report in the December 15 issues as they were

120
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,880
 released December 8, the day of the murder. I also noticed that most of the bullpen headlines read

121
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,640
 like a code about John's assassination. In time for example, "watching civilization slide into

122
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:42,080
 barbarism and banality" all the president's magazines, "death trail, double talk, silencing an

123
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:50,000
 almost free press, jailing the news, the FBI's show of shows, unholy ministry, a gambler's luck

124
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,320
 runs out, death comes from the prime minister, defiant widow in the dock, who's in, who's out,

125
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,680
 fitting together like pieces of a complicated jigsaw puzzle." It was the ominous headline "Who's

126
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:11,360
 in, who's out" above just selected Ronald Reagan that made my heart sink. After all, Reagan was in

127
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:21,440
 and Lenin was out. I then noticed the smaller headline below the photo, "fitting together the

128
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,520
 pieces of a complicated jigsaw puzzle," as well as the fact that Richard Nixon's book "The Real War"

129
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,200
 was in the foreground of the pictures at Reagan's right hand side. I pulled that book off the shelf

130
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,920
 and literally opened right to the page where Nixon writes "The Trendies" who say "war is bad and peace

131
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,160
 is good must be removed from the stage of public debate by whatever means necessary a flyswatter

132
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,200
 are needed." I felt I had just stumbled indeed onto government codes about John's death hidden in

133
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,520
 the headlines of Time Magazine. Newsweek displayed the nearly identical photo of Reagan and The Real

134
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,440
 War above the headline "Head Hunting in the Pacific Palisades." I also found the same odd

135
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,600
 behavior in the headlines. The December 8th issue of Newsweek printed a week before the crime,

136
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,920
 was teeming with bold print in the window up to 75% of the messages plugging into John's

137
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,440
 upcoming murder. Pages 30 and 31 which face each other, reveal the consecutive string of headlines,

138
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,520
 "Odmin' Out," "Bad Blood," "The Nixon Factor," "Stay Tuned," "Intensity." The body of the article

139
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,640
 had passages that read "abruptly withdrew from rising enemy fire." After he was shot down, he

140
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,000
 graciously withdrew. He intimidated some of the older guys with his brash brilliance.

141
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,160
 At that moment, at that moment I knew I had stumbled onto government codes in Time and Newsweek.

142
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,760
 After an hour I became so nauseous I had to leave the library and get some fresh air.

143
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:10,160
 That was the big revelation. Two days later I went to the larger San Diego library and found the

144
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,560
 motherload of bold print codes and even told my girlfriend at the time that my life was in danger

145
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,080
 and I'd have to move back to Santa Rosa near where I was raised to be safer. I first went to a priest

146
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,040
 who advised me to use an alias and rubber gloves for a while. I hitchhiked to Santa Rosa and began

147
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,640
 photocopying my findings and distributing them to the media using an alias and hiding behind sunglasses.

148
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,360
 Weeks later, I found Mark David Chapman attached to a letter to the editor of U.S. News and World

149
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,760
 Report printed three weeks before the murder where Chapman explained he is "armed, waiting to be moved

150
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,600
 into a hostile square by the giant hand of Ronald Reagan." Any doubts I may have had were gone

151
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,000
 and I almost couldn't believe it all myself. U.S. news issues also carried these codes about

152
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,640
 Lennon's assassination but on a more subdued level. I would find that the codes only last for a five

153
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,840
 month period surrounding the crime and found that the September issues were very sparse

154
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,160
 but then a face rolled by on the microfiche and it looked like the assassin getting John's autograph

155
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,480
 that the media show the world. I rolled it back and knew it was him based on the code headline

156
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:41,200
 "One Great Big Zippo Lighter" which describes the murder scene. Then three months to come of a

157
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,840
 man in a raincoat at night with a gun blazing fire in the night. I had no idea who Stephen King was,

158
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,320
 the man attached to the headline and was under the impression that King was an alias. I compared

159
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,200
 the face to the autograph, it was indeed the same exact person. The next day after I had calmed down

160
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:08,400
 enough to actually read the article, a book review about Firestarter, I learned who Stephen King was.

161
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:16,560
 At that explosive moment my first impulse was to credit Nixon for being a criminal genius.

162
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,600
 Who would believe any of it now? Nixon, Reagan, and government codes and magazines were plausible,

163
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 not Stephen King being the real killer. I had a real job ahead of me now.

164
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,400
 A brief examination of the article in King's writings convinced me it was all just too true.

165
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,040
 Now I had to wonder was Chapman even a living person or just some convenient lookalike

166
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,400
 dead Vietnam vet with no family that the government was using to scam us with a decoy?

167
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,880
 I would later learn that Chapman was the son of a wealthy oil executive near Atlanta, Georgia,

168
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,000
 much like John Hinckley who allegedly shot Reagan. I would learn that he was doing a stint in Lebanon,

169
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,440
 supposedly at a YMCA in the years preceding the murder. I would learn that Chapman was living

170
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,280
 allegedly in Attica prison in solitary confinement. People magazine even featured him with photos

171
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,000
 taken at Attica in a 1985 article. People is printed by, you guessed it, time.

172
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,880
 I think Chapman is only in jail for photo ops and to occasionally scam the other prisoners

173
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,160
 that he is there at all. And that the warden on down are in on the scam. I just don't know where

174
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:43,360
 he really spends most of his time. I do know that Hinckley, also an oil executive son, made the

175
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,040
 paper saying he shot Reagan because of Lenin's murder in that quote "America's the land where

176
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,040
 heroes are shot in the back. When John Lenin died I died, you died, America died, the world died."

177
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:02,240
 Presumably as part of a mind control maneuver to suggest that one would have to be crazy to think

178
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,040
 Reagan and Lenin killed. After Hinckley was found and saying no one was parodying that line of logic.

179
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,560
 A few months after I had pieced together all the codes and evidence,

180
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,560
 Terry Chodish of the San Francisco Secret Service surprised me with a visit

181
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,160
 while I was at the Santa Rosa Library. He never denied my claims and even asked me what I thought

182
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:36,320
 about Hinckley. At that time I was as ignorant as anyone else about Hinckley. He took some photographs

183
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,280
 of me, warned me I could be arrested for any threats I might make towards these politicians,

184
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,920
 and had me offer some handwriting samples and left.

185
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:53,040
 I realized the next day that those samples might be used to forge a suicide note someday.

186
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:01,200
 I called him back and complained emphatically. I saw him years later out of disguise, without his

187
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,000
 blonde wig and blue contacts, with his real brown hair and eyes outside the federal building.

188
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,000
 After the first meeting, my life turned into a political dissident hell.

189
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,040
 See footnotes and new developments page of this website.

190
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:24,000
 Along the way I saw my influence shape events in ways only I could see.

191
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,560
 I'm amazed at how big a dent I have already made and yet I'm still aghast at how little

192
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:41,920
 support I have received from my fellow man and Americans. My own mother and my siblings,

193
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,800
 the one constituency who should have helped me come forward so I could remove my life from danger,

194
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,200
 have taken a step back from my plight. I have witnessed the apathy of my country.

195
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,400
 I've come to appreciate that it is fueled by their own sense of shame, fear, jealousy,

196
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:11,280
 and I'll say it, misery. Everyone's afraid where political assassination is concerned, but me.

197
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,800
 Even Paul McCartney who endorsed me live at Berkeley, see website,

198
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:23,360
 has retreated singing "words of non-wisdom" lately.

199
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,920
 Letting civilization slide into barbarism and banality.

200
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,360
 His recent 2002 concert passed without a relevant remark.

201
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,680
 I don't trust Yoko to do anything but protect the lie and her estate.

202
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,400
 I feel sorry for New York City that they can't see through her.

203
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,920
 I feel sorry for New York that they tolerated a no trial necessary remedy for Lenin's assassination.

204
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,960
 No wonder America is in such shambles.

205
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,200
 New York City is out of control and disconnected, living under government which

206
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:12,880
 Yoko Ono's evil spell. I worry about all of you people for having to have me tell you why this

207
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,120
 is important and vital to begin with. When I started I assumed everyone would know that this

208
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:27,440
 expose will unleash more power to the people than at any time in our lifetimes. If you're not excited

209
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,040
 by that fact you indeed need my prayers too. Thank you for visiting my website.

210
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:44,400
 Only you can expose this story. It'll never be told until you people change. First, deep inside.

211
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,360
 Don't keep me waiting. I need your help and support. Break this story, please.

212
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:21,280
 So that is the About the Author section of Lenin Murder Truth. You know as much as I was giggling

213
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,200
 and stuff in the front I'm obviously recording it and listening back to it while I'm editing it.

214
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:35,760
 He comes across just so heartfelt and it's interesting because as I was reading it for

215
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,120
 the first time and then again listening back to edit this there's like this looming cloud of red

216
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,680
 because he's starting off he's talking about you know the finding the clues and then he talks about

217
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,600
 his like golf career. He was he wanted to be like a what was it a pro amateur golfer or pro golfer

218
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,800
 something like that and the whole time when he starts going off on this quest to find the truth

219
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:07,440
 you can all he doesn't mention his family and the whole time I was in it I was like oh I know how

220
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,480
 this is gonna end because this is how it always ends. The family at a certain point just has to

221
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:24,240
 cut ties it's really sad. I imagine being Steve's friend early on back when this was all first

222
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,480
 breaking or being his brother sister whatever but you know what I mean just having that every

223
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,680
 afternoon him coming home before if this I can't imagine how this all would have played out if

224
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,800
 the internet was around but he was like traveling to libraries and making a day of it and then he'll

225
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,920
 come back at the dinner table and he'll be like oh man you won't believe it today I found these three

226
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:54,960
 codes and at first you would be like oh okay okay Steve but after like what how long could you do it

227
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,840
 for two three months you eventually you would start getting upset because he's showing you and he

228
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,080
 makes references to this a couple time in these manifestos where he's showing you these codes and

229
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 to him he's thinking how is nobody else getting this how these codes are so look at this headline

230
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,000
 right here kiss kiss bang bang uh what was the other part ouch ouch look at that headline and look

231
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,320
 at that date Jason can't you see and I I would be like well it's a headline and the date but no

232
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,480
 no no no but then you have to look at this headline and this headline and I look up those three headlines

233
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,560
 and I go Steve I you know we've been going over this for months I don't see anything and how frustrated

234
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:44,000
 you would be if to you it was a hundred percent in the clear this is what's going on

235
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 and you just can't no one believes you and worse people think you're crazy like legitimately crazy

236
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,000
 again I'm not gonna cast I think this guy's a little wacky I don't necessarily I don't I'm

237
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,640
 did not qualify to say that he's crazy these these beliefs have as much validity Stephen King

238
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,560
 shooting John Lennon at the behest of Richard Nixon has as much validity honestly if you think

239
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,640
 about it as 90 percent of the other conspiracy theories out there easily as much validity is

240
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,720
 something like flatters easily you could say well building seven has video footage and stuff like

241
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,800
 that but and and so it maybe has a little bit of leg up you know moon landing you can look at the

242
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,120
 but stuff that is just completely like nope this is just because I think it is I don't know how

243
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,760
 gravity this has as much validity as flat earth so you know it's easy to kind of poo poo conspiracy

244
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,240
 theories just off hand because they're ludicrous so they don't make sense to you but it's about 99

245
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,240
 percent of them are ludicrous and 90 percent of them have as much evidence as this one does supporting

246
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,280
 it and we'll be covering a bunch of those so I've been researching conspiracy theories since I was

247
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,840
 probably about 15 no no no no it would have been younger than that I remember and back then you

248
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,840
 know I'm I'm maybe 20 years younger than Steven like but definitely older than the internet

249
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,120
 the internet proper when we all had access to it I was reading books I'd have to go to libraries and

250
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,800
 read books so I can empathize with this guy you know I'd go to books I'd go and read these books

251
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,240
 about the Mimico triangle about conspiracy theories and missing people and stuff like that and I was

252
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,720
 like oh this awesome and I was reading it as a form of entertainment and thinking maybe this is true

253
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:48,000
 and being a little scared imagine though if that wasn't the case imagine if I was like no 100

254
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,680
 these people are disappearing because of holes in fabric and I can prove it I can absolutely

255
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,280
 prove it I'm reading all these books and every time someone goes missing I'm putting a little pin

256
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,120
 prick in a door pin prick in a map and my family going okay at first they're like oh that's interesting

257
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,760
 you know Jason kind of has an interesting theory and then at a certain point the family just has

258
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,320
 to start going oh Jason because every time someone goes missing they'll be like god damn it I know

259
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,520
 the second Jason gets home he's going to talk about the blue hell the blue hell the missing

260
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:30,720
 people go to there is an episode coming up about blue hell but I just you know I feel bad I feel bad

261
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,160
 you know it throughout his website and again linenmurdertruth.com go there buy his book

262
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,840
 he's selling his cars he's constantly talking about being in financial debt he obviously has

263
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:50,080
 he's held jobs in the past his website goes over so much in detail about not only is his political

264
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,360
 beliefs and his conspiratorial beliefs but his life for 20 something years he's been

265
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,120
 doing this almost what 30 now he's held on to this and you know like I was saying the

266
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,920
 family backing away from him imagine that you had a cause a goal a purpose that was so noble and yet

267
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,960
 every time you move towards it someone was grabbing your pants pulling you down grabbing your pants

268
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,840
 pulling you down keeping you from climbing up that hill that you believe at the end is the greatest

269
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:29,120
 conspiracy since the time of Jesus Christ and you're living in your van in Southern California

270
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:40,880
 it boggles the mind it boggles the mind to be that devoted to something that

271
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,360
 you know has evidence that you can see

272
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,120
 I don't know it's pretty insane and I'm like he's wacky I'm not saying he's insane just the idea

273
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,280
 of it and it's not what and let me back up I'm not being like oh I don't want to hurt his feelings

274
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,760
 when I say that I don't know him I'll probably call other people insane and lunatic and blah blah

275
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:14,640
 blah from here on out I don't he he has some insane beliefs I don't know I don't know maybe

276
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,440
 there's a little bit of empathy for um I was talking more trash about other people on the

277
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,920
 past couple episodes maybe I just have a little bit empathy for him just because of the amount

278
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,040
 of time he's poured into this I don't know now I'm not so charitable I'm gonna give him a bunch of

279
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,360
 money just because this I will say this I looked him up on YouTube and he looked way more normal

280
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,800
 than I thought he would he describes himself as a youngest looking man I I'd agree with that

281
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,120
 um but yeah yeah it's just it's just weird to me it's just weird and I guess that's what this

282
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,560
 podcast is about it's just about the weird things that are out there that most of us don't know about

283
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,760
 a lot of it's going to be current events a lot of it's stuff that's just going to be happening in

284
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,600
 the moment water cooler talk but some of it's going to be a little bit longer and more in depth

285
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,560
