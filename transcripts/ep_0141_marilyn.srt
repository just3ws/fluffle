1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 Today we take a ride on a ghost train that is still seen plowing across the deserts of Arizona

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,000
 then we meet the

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,700
 Unluckiest man in the world until he wasn't and

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,800
 Then finally we look at an interesting conspiracy

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,240
 And one that has a bit of backing to it was Marilyn Monroe killed

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,320
 To cover up the truth of UFOs today on Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,920
 *Music*

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvin

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
 Or I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,360
 So I'm gonna spare you the Star Trek jokes this episode. We're gonna jump right into it. Jump! Weeee!

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,160
 Arizona, the state that never sleeps because it's so hot there you can't sleep. That's where we're at

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,240
 Arizona. It's just one giant flat state. Every so often you see a giant stump of a tree. Ah, you thought those were amasis?

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,320
 No, those are tree stumps, but we're here. We're in the Dragoon Mountains

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,000
 Which sounds dope. I think that's the name of French soldiers who shoot guns

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,880
 Well, they all do now, but back in the day the Dragoons, I think were the first armed

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,320
 French soldiers, but anyways it doesn't matter.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,520
 Between Dragoon and the town of Wilcox, Arizona. This has been spotted multiple times by multiple people over the years.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,680
 A phantom train. Sometimes you just see the light on the train. Not just the light like the sun

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,400
 But sometimes you just see like the front of the headlight. Why do you put a headlight on a train? It's not like it can turn

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,600
 I guess they could break. By the time the beam of light hits whatever in the

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,680
 train's way

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,040
 You cannot be able to stop it. I mean how how many lumens did they have back in the 1800s?

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,920
 Like I bet you that train that headlight on the train. Oh, oh, I guess it's so other people can see the train coming

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,800
 Never mind. So anyways, you learned something Jason. You taught yourself something the train

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,200
 Actually, what a ghost train make noise actually a ghost make noise so it makes sense

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,280
 Tickets, please you get off the train hobo

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,720
 Ghost hobos are getting thrown off the train. They're like just evaporating in nowhere slimmers back there. He's eating all the food slimer

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,920
 Anyways, this ghost train's coming through the desert. People have seen it over the years. They've heard it over the years

29
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,560
 They're like why is all these hot dogs just in the middle of the desert?

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,840
 The weirdest thing is if the ghost train with hobos and slimer on it aren't weird enough

31
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,000
 There's never been a train laid in the area where the train

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,680
 is seen

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,480
 Now all the articles I read about the ghost train were like there's a ghost train

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,920
 People have seen it and heard it for years, but here's the weird part

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,560
 There's never been a train

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,120
 Where the ghost train seen and I'm thinking

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,480
 So it's not like the train has a ghost. I have a better point better question here. Let's say that

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:15,240
 Okay, so let's say the ghost train exists and it's chugging along in the middle of nowhere a place where train tracks had never been laid down

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,520
 Did they see trains like in 600 ad in that area where like the native america?

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:28,840
 That's a bigger question to me not there's never been a train there. Well, who cares if there's not go ghosts don't have trains

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,920
 Don't leave ghosts

42
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,640
 So whether or not there's a train there is totally irrelevant to the fact that there is a ghost train

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
 but

44
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,560
 I think the more interesting question is

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,640
 600 ad you have native americans live in in arizona

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,160
 I don't know why it's super hot down there and there's no animals, but they're down there

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,040
 Was the ghost train there then?

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,080
 Would they have seen this thing and they'd have no concept for the noises it made for the size for the speed

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,040
 They're like why who are all these ghost hobos? What's a hobo and then everything just vanishes like

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,760
 What did they see in that area?

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,400
 The apache do consider the area sacred

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,840
 Now I will say this I say trains don't have ghosts

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,040
 But if there was a train that got lost or derailed and to this day people still say they can see

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,680
 The ghost of the train coming down the tracks whatever but this train is in the middle of nowhere

55
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
 When did they start seeing it?

56
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,760
 Did people see it before they knew what a train was and the reason why this is an important question?

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,920
 If that's true

58
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,160
 If that train has always been there and no one could recognize what it was until other people who and it invented the train

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
 Saw the train and go oh, that's a train. That's what that is

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,920
 Do ghosts work in any sort of time?

61
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,560
 time

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 Chain what's timeline?

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,960
 Or are they just there?

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,880
 Whenever like the ghosts that we see are they people who have died before or is it possible that there are people who will die?

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,280
 eventually

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,160
 Like if i'm looking at a ghost, how do I know if okay if a ghost train can exist in the middle of nowhere?

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,760
 And i'm looking at a ghost in my living room. It's possible that that guy won't die until 50 years from now

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,360
 But when he died his soul is trapped in this timeline or it's appearing in this timeline

69
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,240
 But he may still be alive 2 000 years from now. Does that make sense? Like i i

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,440
 That's the thing that I always get kind of squirrelly with ghosts is

71
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,200
 Living people measure stuff on a linear timeline because our lives are on a linear timeline

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,960
 but to a ghost to something who exists for eternity

73
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 A linear timeline is

74
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,520
 Doesn't make sense

75
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,720
 Does that make sense because technically infinity would or eternity would doesn't it go both ways?

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
 I don't know man

77
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,600
 You know people always accuse me of smoking weed before I do this show and i'm like

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,400
 This is always my response. There was no way I could do a daily show if I smoked marijuana. Absolutely not. I think

79
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,520
 My i'm just perma stone because I did spend a lot of time in my 20s partying

80
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,920
 And my brain just can't stop working sometimes ghost train. What are the serious ramifications for?

81
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,920
 Don't do drugs kids by the way. Um ghost trains

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,160
 What would be the serious ramifications if it if the oh my god, it's blowing my mind

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,920
 If the train was never there

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,280
 But there's a ghost of a train if we accept those two things as facts

85
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,520
 Then you also have to extrapolate that to say that every ghost or a good likely amount of ghosts that we see

86
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,400
 Are not tied to that physical location. Our linear timeline is looking at a ghost and saying I know Mary queen of scots died here

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,600
 Therefore that ghost looks like Mary queen of scots. However, that ghost could be a cosplayer

88
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,120
 From 80 years in the future who died wearing her mary queen of scott uniform. Bam, dude

89
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,680
 I just answered every ghost sighting ever. You can thank me later. Don't do drugs kids. Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,920
 Okay, now we're going to go to

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
 Croatia now

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,040
 If you want to go quickly, there's only one way to get there. It's all cleaned out, baby

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,360
 We got the carboner copter hop on in

94
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:13,160
 Isn't it nice through and I got it. It's all clean. I got all these air fresheners cut the doors wide open

95
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
 So hold on to something

96
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,400
 If you don't get the reference a bunch of people pooped in it a couple episodes ago

97
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,600
 We're in Croatia. We also had to go back in time during our flight

98
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,520
 We are going to watch the life and times of a man. Tell me this doesn't sound like a star trek character

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,520
 I said I wasn't going to do any star trek jokes, but this guy sounds like a star trek character

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,680
 His name is frayne selec

101
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,080
 Don't fool me. That's a star trek character. You're a time traveler, but anyways, we land

102
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,480
 In frayne selecs yard and he's like get out of here your kids in your wacky contraption because we're back in

103
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,000
 Oh, I guess they had helicopters back in 1962. He's like get out of here kids with your contraption that I'm vaguely aware of

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,280
 He's shaking a pitchfork at it. Actually frayne seems to be a pretty nice guy. So he's like, I'm just kidding

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,440
 Come on in. Let's hang out for a bit. We don't really want to hang out with him

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,480
 Now if you haven't seen the movie final destination, it's the movie where death tries to kill you

107
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,200
 You escape and I love final destination 4. That's one of my favorite movies

108
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,320
 The series is good, but final destination 4 called the final destination is one of the bests

109
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,800
 One of the best horror movies. Absolutely love it. But anyways, that's the setup for those movies

110
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 You escape death and then death tries to get you again until you eventually die

111
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,960
 Let's look at frayne selecs life

112
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,440
 First off, he was a romulan officer on a warbird. No, I'm just joking. Okay. Okay in 1962

113
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,080
 He was in a train

114
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,560
 Another train no ghost hobos nothing like that the train however flips off the tracks crashes into the river

115
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,680
 17 people drown. He swims the shore one year later 1963

116
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,880
 He's flying in a plane the door of the plane

117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:02,040
 Malfunctions pops open. He is thrown out of the plane. I don't know what height but not super high

118
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,840
 He's thrown out of the plane. He lands in a haystack plane crashes killing 19 people

119
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,320
 He never flew on another plane three years after that. He was in a bus

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:19,240
 Slid off the road into the river. He swims the shore four people drown four years later. So now we're in 1970

121
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,720
 He's rocking the bell bottoms harry chest huge medallion. He's driving a car

122
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:32,520
 Car catches on fire. He jumps out of his car and gets away before the car explodes three years later 1973 drive in a car

123
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,400
 A malfunctioning fuel a lot of malfunctions a malfunctioning fuel pump begins leaking hot oil onto his engine

124
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,040
 Flame shoots out of his heater vents into his car burns his hair off

125
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,080
 But he survives and then nothing until 1995

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,720
 He gets hit by a bus

127
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,400
 minor injuries

128
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,600
 One year later this I think all of that's bad, but this I thought was quite chilling

129
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,840
 1996 he's driving on a curvy mountain road

130
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,560
 And a united nation's truck comes out of relatively nowhere and now they're about to have a head-on collision

131
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,840
 He swerves into the guard rail to avoid the truck the guard rail gives away

132
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,440
 Now because when he swerved the impact of the car

133
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,120
 He wasn't wearing his seatbelt and when his car hit his door swung open

134
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,720
 He flew out of his car grabbed onto a tree

135
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,120
 Car plummets down a 300 foot gorge and he's just standing there

136
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,760
 All of these had been documented throughout his life the you and truck I hope stopped and helped them

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,160
 They're like no we only help nations not just you

138
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,800
 But anyways fraying selec

139
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,280
 survived death multiple times

140
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,880
 2003 two days after his 73rd birthday wins a million dollars in the lottery

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,040
 buys much houses buys a boat gives a rest to his friends and family

142
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,480
 Died peacefully 89 years old. Can you imagine dodging death that many times in your life?

143
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,200
 Like I mean at a sur after okay

144
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,720
 I've had some pretty scary run-ins with like car accidents and like sketchy situations in places

145
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,400
 I shouldn't have been things like that but after the fourth time I got in a vehicle and it either exploded or drove off the road

146
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,080
 I I'd be like i'm done. Actually, that's kind of what I have done

147
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,680
 I've been in seven car accidents and I'm like I don't need to drive. I'll just walk everywhere

148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,040
 So like yeah, I mean, but this guy's like oh my my car blew up

149
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,640
 Good thing it's fully insured time to buy another car and it catches on fire

150
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,480
 I don't know crazy, but luckiest or unluckiest man

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,880
 I mean it's pretty lucky to win a million dollars

152
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,240
 But it'd be even more lucky if he won a million dollars when he was younger

153
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,200
 But he had it and he said you know his his view was I bought what he wanted and then he's like

154
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,640
 I'll just give the rest of my family and kids luckiest or unluckiest man

155
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,760
 You decide I guess luckiest really because he survived the whole time

156
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,960
 I found that story when I was looking up the farthest falls

157
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,600
 He was listed as one of the people who survived the plain fold

158
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,200
 But I mean he fell into a pile of hay like a loonatoon character

159
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
 He doesn't even see how high the plane was

160
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,880
 But I thought I was like oh this this guy needs to just get his own little segment

161
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,920
 But let's go ahead. Okay, so we're gonna say buy to frame

162
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,400
 Buy frame sell like he's like buy and then we notice he talks into his calm and he's like

163
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,640
 Let the tal shia know that the romulan's well. He's a star trek character

164
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's a star trek name

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
 But anyways, we'll leave the star trek romulan infiltrator behind

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,440
 But we hop into the carpenter copter

167
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,680
 We're on our way to Hollywood the land of glitz and glamour

168
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,000
 Everything's beautiful in Hollywood everything's I have a friend who went to Hollywood to be an actor

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,400
 And I go how are the women down there and he looks at me like I'm an idiot

170
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,480
 He's like, how do you think dude? They're all gorgeous. I was like, yeah

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,680
 I guess that was kind of a self answering question

172
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,440
 But anyway, so hey, Jonas if you listen to the show so we

173
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,200
 Are in the carpenter copter now we do have to make a quick stop

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,040
 I got to get some ampm hamburgers because I love those gas station burgers

175
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,440
 Oh, wait. I'm on keto. Damn it. Ah, I just have to fly over the amp. I'm gonna be like, uh, damn it

176
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
 We fly over

177
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,280
 But we got to be careful we're gonna put on stealth mode

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,840
 Not super stealthy

179
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,760
 But because we know

180
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,840
 The cia is listening to a very intriguing phone call

181
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,160
 Marilyn Monroe famous movie actress

182
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
 Singer I think I think she was in some musicals

183
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 She had been sleeping with

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,280
 Both the president of the united states and his brother

185
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,920
 Attorney general robert kennedy. I don't think I could share a woman with my brother

186
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,800
 Maybe maryland Monroe

187
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,600
 But I don't think so so anyways or british fierce, but no, that's gross dude

188
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,280
 They'd be getting all dna mixed up and stuff in there. Anyway, so

189
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,240
 That that aside that aside maryland roe was sleeping with both president kennedy and

190
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 Attorney general bobby kennedy

191
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,880
 But they had kind of ghosted her at this point. They were like, no, I wouldn't want to talk to you anymore

192
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,120
 And she was starting to lose her luster in hollywood

193
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,200
 Marilyn Monroe was no longer the big star that she had used to be

194
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,880
 august 3rd

195
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
 1962

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,320
 There was a phone call that the cia recorded because cia had maryland Monroe's phone tapped

197
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,760
 Because they knew she knew stuff about the president kennedy and

198
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
 Robert kennedy

199
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,200
 And they had the phones tapped of maryland roe's friends now

200
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,240
 That's the thing whenever people talk about conspiracies and they're like, well, you know

201
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,720
 That's not true that we find bits and pieces of true conspiracies here and there

202
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,320
 There's the conspiracy that maryland roe didn't commit suicide that she was murdered people are like what no

203
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,760
 There's no way she had all these drugs in her system only people who commit suicide do that

204
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,080
 There's no assassin wouldn't make you take drugs

205
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,040
 But then we have recordings of phone call. We know her phone was being tapped in this wiretap

206
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,800
 Which was found during a freedom of information act request

207
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,600
 It is regarding a conversation between a reporter dorthy killigan

208
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,120
 Sorry, not killigan dorthy kill glenn and her close friend, howard rothberg

209
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,000
 And I believe that when they're saying her close friend, they're referring to maryland roe's close friend

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,040
 Government talk isn't always the most specific. I'm going to read this to you. This is an actual cia document

211
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,640
 Rothberg discussed the apparent comeback of subject with maryland roe with kill glenn and the breakup with the kinities

212
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:25,960
 Rothberg told kill glenn that she was attending hollywood parties hosted by quote-unquote

213
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,320
 Inner circle among hollywood's elite and was becoming the talk of the town again

214
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:40,280
 Rothberg indicated in so many words that she has secrets to tell no doubt arising from her trists with the president and the attorney general

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,680
 One such secret and what's weird secrets and air quotes secrets and quotations there

216
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,880
 One such quote-unquote secret mentions the visit by the president

217
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,920
 So before I get on the next part the cia is listening in on this phone call and maryland roe's friend is talking to a reporter

218
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,720
 And he's like yeah, you know, she's she's making the rounds in hollywood. She's really trying to get herself back out there

219
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,840
 She's talking to the high and mighty the elite in hollywood. She's trying to get back into show business

220
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,680
 Cia agents like, you know, listen into it. This is the next part that comes out and this is what the cia agent typed up

221
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:23,320
 This is their official report one such secret mentions the visit by the president at a secret airbase for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space

222
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:32,760
 Kill glenn replied that she knew what might be the source of visit in the mid fifties kill glenn learned of secret effort by us and uk governments to

223
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,280
 identify the origins of crash spacecraft and dead bodies from a british government official

224
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,640
 Kill glenn believed the story may have come from the new mexico story in the late forties

225
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,120
 Kill glenn said if the story is true

226
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,960
 It would cause terrible embarrassment for jack and his plans to have nasa put men on the moon

227
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,600
 So you have this conversation between maryland roe's friend saying hey, she wants to get back into show business

228
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,080
 Yeah, she also told me this weird story how the president went out to some secret base and

229
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,680
 To go look at stuff from outer space and the reporter goes

230
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,840
 Hmm. I kind of I know a little bit something about that

231
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,360
 I talked to a british official a couple years ago back in the fifties

232
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,400
 And he told me that we have been in contact with a small race of beans

233
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,680
 And we believe that they crashed at some place in new mexico. I don't remember and

234
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,880
 We're worried that they may be some sort of

235
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
 problem

236
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,920
 Dorothy kill glenn is a reporter, but she's known as a gossip columnist as well

237
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,080
 She reported the findings of the ufo of the british guy

238
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,640
 That was from back in the

239
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,360
 So that story that she had written

240
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,760
 Was from 1955 so it was a good seven years before this meeting

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,160
 She had written up in this gossip column basically saying that

242
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,600
 The british government has encountered a ufo. They don't know what it is

243
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,560
 They actually have the wreckage and they know the body's like they're a little they're little tiny people and all that stuff

244
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,960
 Stuff that we commonly know as grace now. There's two separate statements

245
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,800
 One is someone who's close to marylandman row saying marylandman row says that the president said he went to a base and

246
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,280
 Went to go see things from outer space and then the reporter interjects. Oh, I know what you're talking about

247
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,560
 I know a guy who who believes aliens are here

248
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,920
 She never named the name of the british official, which I mean can be a sign of deception or it can also be a sign

249
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
 of the guy doesn't want to be called a kook

250
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,680
 so

251
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,400
 What in the world are we supposed to glean from this cia document?

252
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,360
 if there's so much weird stuff in this because

253
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,000
 If jfk is willing to tell

254
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,080
 marylandman row about the secret trip and if he did see aliens

255
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,280
 She would know that as well. She would she would have revealed that to her friend or would she

256
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,200
 Kilgill in who did do a story on aliens back in the 50s talking to an unnamed british official

257
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,760
 She kind of threw in her own two cents, but even if we knew that there was aliens out there

258
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,520
 Why would she make the final phrase it would cause a terrible embarrassment for jackness plans to have nasa put men on the moon

259
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,280
 Why would would it be embarrassing because our technology was so limited?

260
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,640
 Would it be embarrassing because it wouldn't work because the aliens would destroy it now at this time?

261
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,440
 Yuri gargan has already floated around space like russians have already launched the first man's space capsule

262
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,520
 He orbited and came down normally

263
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,720
 There was a theory that jfk visiting the objects from outer space

264
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,840
 Was actually remains of soviet technology that has shot up into space and fell down

265
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
 I don't really know if that washes with this

266
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:41,560
 Because that would also be something marillon row be like if jfk told marylandman row this stuff

267
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,000
 She could say yeah, he went and saw some space junk from the russkies and but it's so vague

268
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,680
 To see things from outer space and to make it even more puzzling. This isn't the whole report

269
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,080
 There's a single page from the cia that includes that story

270
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,640
 And then phone taps from marillon row's own phone where she was calling up

271
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:11,800
 bobby kennedy calling up jfk's brother. This is what again, it's it's not the exact transcript. It's what the cia notes say

272
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,040
 marillon row repeatedly called the attorney general and complained about the way she was being ignored by the president and his brother

273
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,360
 Marillon row threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all

274
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,040
 Marillon row made reference to bases in cuba and knew of the president's plan to kill castro

275
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 Marillon row made reference to her diary of secrets and what the newspaper would do with such disclosures

276
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,320
 Now it makes sense that they don't say exactly what that is because the cia doesn't want to put that information

277
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,080
 It's information that they know and they don't want to put it in a report

278
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,960
 two days after that

279
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 memo was created

280
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
 marillon row was found dead

281
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,680
 suicide drug overdose

282
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,080
 again

283
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,560
 If the cia was completely covering up the existence of ufo's that would they have included that first part in the document?

284
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,800
 They could have redacted it so we would have never seen it

285
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,000
 The fact that they leave in the part about the bases and the plot to kill castro

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,520
 We know about that so it makes sense that that part wasn't redacted

287
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,080
 I mean it's a mind boggler because you have this document that really makes it look like

288
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,280
 She was ready to release all this information

289
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,240
 We don't know what it is

290
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,360
 We can assume that when she says she's going to tell all that it relates to

291
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,760
 UFOs and et's and all this stuff or it could just be i'm going to tell me have a tiny dick

292
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,320
 We don't know exactly what the conversation was and what she was threatening to reveal

293
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:46,120
 I think just this document alone makes it look like she was murdered to cover up her from blabbing her mouth and pro tip

294
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,240
 Don't run your mouth and second pro tip if you're going to don't tell anyone you're going to

295
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,960
 Ever because this is what happens

296
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:01,320
 But her threatening we hear her words to bobby kennedy saying this is what i'm going to do this for other second conversation

297
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,920
 Is all hearsay it's two people repeating what another person has been told

298
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,360
 Did marillon row know about the ufo's?

299
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,000
 Did was marillon min row killed to cover up something and possibly that's something being alien life

300
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,320
 There's a third possibility

301
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,480
 That this document is fake

302
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,600
 We don't really have a provenance on the

303
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,280
 ci

304
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,040
 Document it's turned up in someone else's collection. I believe you can order it yourself

305
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:38,040
 But until I do I can't say for sure that it's 100 accurate, but other people have vouched for it

306
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,200
 I mean, you know ufo allegis, so I don't you know take it with a grain of salt

307
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,640
 They're saying that the cia is never specifically denied that this document is fake

308
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,280
 And it was this weird thing where someone said I want the actual transcripts released and the answer was kind of like

309
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,600
 Well, you already have that so in a roundabout way and I'm really like shortening the little legal battle that went on but

310
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,440
 In a roundabout way, it's been confirmed to be accurate

311
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
 But we don't know

312
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,440
 It could easily be a forgery. I did read an interesting thing and they said this guy goes

313
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,120
 I've read a lot of forgeries in my life about ufo stuff and he goes normally he goes if this was a forgery

314
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
 This is how I think they would have done it

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,800
 They would have said marillon min row said that she saw aliens and she saw a flying disc and they always hype it up

316
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,640
 When you're making a forgery for the ufo community you make it even more hype

317
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,120
 And make it really like throw some green men. Yeah, yeah, put the pleidians in there like they make it more

318
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,840
 And he goes this one's actually doesn't seem like a hoax just because it's so down to earth

319
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,760
 It's very vague. He goes they never actually even really use the word alien or ufo in it

320
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,480
 If it's real if this is a real document

321
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,200
 That's really creepy

322
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,800
 These phone calls are being recorded two days before she dies

323
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 That's you know, that's a really big coincidence

324
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,880
 But who knows

325
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,120
 Yeah, I always thought that marillon min row. I always figured marillon min row was killed honestly

326
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,840
 That's a conspiracy theory. I believe and that she didn't commit suicide

327
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,080
 I've always believed in that

328
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,600
 But I always thought she got killed because she knew too much or she got too deep in the mob or

329
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,080
 Something like that. I I never would have thought she knew anything about flying saucers

330
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,080
 But according to this document if it's real she knew something and what she knew

331
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,800
 May have sent her to the grave

332
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,920
