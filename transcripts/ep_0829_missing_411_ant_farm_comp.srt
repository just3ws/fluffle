1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 What happens when a man's fetish destroys an entire country?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,440
 True story.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then in this copyrighted episode of Dead Rabbit Radio,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
 we're gonna take a look at the story of Missing 411.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,680
 Specifically, the biggest question everyone has about Missing 411,

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,960
 where are the missing people going today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,880
 I'm a walkie-talkie.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another copyrighted episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,240
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,200
 We got a bunch of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,080
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,880
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give a big round of applause for

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
 Bezelhorn.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
 Woo, yeah!

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 Give him a round of applause.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
 Has he been pushed in to the fetish episode?

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,720
 You never know when you support this show what episode you're gonna end up on.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,080
 Bezelhorn, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 Just help spread the word about this show really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,400
 Now, Bezelhorn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,160
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,960
 We're taking a nice leisurely journey all the way out to the country,

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
 formally known as Hugo Salavia.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,680
 I gotta give a shout out to Johnny Thunder AuraCat.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
 Johnny is a member of our Patreon Discord and they're the ones who introduced me to the story.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,800
 So to my delight and to all of you guys suffering,

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,280
 you can thank or blame Johnny.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,800
 Fascinating story.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,560
 You know, we're looking at a lot about what's going on in the Ukraine

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,480
 right now with Russia and we're looking at like these protests all over the world.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,280
 All this civil unrest that seems to be going on.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 And when we think about history, we tend to think of, you know, the first shot of the

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,600
 Revolutionary War or like the dude who was like walking around in Vietnam and being like,

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
 "I'm going over there."

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,480
 And they're like, "No, no, no."

40
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,360
 And then like an invasion.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,240
 I don't know much about the history of Vietnam, but you know what I mean?

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,680
 Like you have, we always think it's these big moments, right?

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
 When we think about World War II, when we think about the United States entering World War II,

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,520
 it's Pearl Harbor, right?

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
 Ben Affleck's running away from bombs and stuff like that.

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,640
 And we all felt bad for him.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
 So we invaded.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,680
 So, but what really happens is there's usually a lot of little things that lead up to this.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,480
 Maybe there was a guy who threw his ball in Vietnam and I like rolled over to the South

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
 and he's like, "Well, I guess I got to invade now."

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,960
 So it's the little things sometimes.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
 And that's why I really, really love this story.

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,320
 It's May 1st, 1985, and we're in the town of Gilan, Kosovo.

54
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,000
 And at this point, Yugoslavia was still like a country.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
 You had, Kosovo was like an autonomous region.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
 You had Serbia was like a state.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
 Nowadays, try finding any of the stuff on the map.

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
 They're all individual countries.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,600
 But at this point, you had the full country of Yugoslavia.

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,560
 It was pretty diverse country.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
 You had a lot of Christians, a lot of Muslims.

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,480
 You had like the ethnic, original ethnic group that lived there.

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
 And it was all getting chopped up and rearranged and all this stuff,

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
 due to all these world wars and things like that.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,400
 But it was diverse, but it was also a very, very uneasy alliance.

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
 You had the Albanians who tended to be Muslims.

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
 You had the Serbians who tended to be Orthodox Christians.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
 And neither of them liked each other.

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
 They're living next to each other.

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,520
 They're sharing this country.

71
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,840
 Things aren't going well.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,280
 But there's actually laws against national, or there were laws against nationalism in Yugoslavia.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
 You couldn't walk around, you know, because they just had to deal with world war two

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
 and they could see where it would go.

75
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
 So they're like, you can't walk around and talk about how you guys are the true

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,760
 citizens of the country.

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,880
 You can't be like, yo, Yugoslavia first, Yugoslavia first.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,360
 We're barely maintaining things right now.

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,480
 They didn't have the freedom of speech to say how great their country was

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
 or how great their ethnic group was or particular state.

81
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
 It was against the law.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,240
 But on May 1st, this dude shows up at a local hospital.

83
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,520
 His name is Dordi Martinovic.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,720
 He's a 56 year old guy and he comes walking into the hospital and he's like,

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,040
 and they're like, oh, okay, we know exactly what we can tell.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
 We've worked at this hospital for a long time.

87
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
 We can tell exactly where this patient needs to go.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,160
 Let's get him into a bed, stat and make sure he's laying on his stomach when he walks in.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
 And like the new nurse working there is like, what?

90
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,240
 What?

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
 He's just doing this little weird dance.

92
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
 So how do you know how he's supposed to lay down on a bed?

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,480
 And the doctor on duty turns and looks, says, I'll bet you 50 bucks.

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,600
 That man has something stuck up his butthole.

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
 And he did.

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,160
 The doctor didn't actually make bets on how these people were sick.

97
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
 It's a narrative device.

98
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,040
 But if it was the doctor would have won because Dordi had a bottle,

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
 a soda bottle stuck up his butthole.

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
 And eventually the doctors, as they're trying to remove this bottle,

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,200
 which I should clarify right here, it was not, it wasn't the narrow end up.

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
 You can imagine a glass Coca-Cola bottle.

103
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,640
 It wasn't the part you put to your lips and go refreshing.

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,720
 It was the, it was the much wider, much harder piece.

105
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
 To get up a human butthole.

106
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
 And their, their doctors are asking, as they're laughing,

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
 as they're openly laughing at this guy.

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,320
 So what happened?

109
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,160
 How could this bottle get up your butthole?

110
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,280
 They're already taking bets.

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 They're already taking bets on how it happened.

112
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
 He goes, so I'm sitting there and working in my field.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
 I'm a simple man, right?

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,960
 These two Albanians showed up.

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
 Still Albanians showed up.

116
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,920
 And they said, hey, hey you, you look like you use a refreshing Coca-Cola.

117
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,440
 And I was like, no, no, sir, no.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
 I already drank a Coca-Cola.

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,760
 It was quite refreshing.

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,640
 This episode sponsored by Coca-Cola, by the way.

121
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,560
 And these two Albanians, one held me down and the other one took this bottle,

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
 shoved it up my butthole.

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,920
 Now this hospital could not get the bottle out.

124
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,560
 So they had to imagine that.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,320
 They had to air lift him to another hospital.

126
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
 He's like hanging on a harness.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,640
 Everyone's looking up there like, hey, look at that beer bottles in his butthole.

128
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,800
 They fly him to this other hospital and the doctors,

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
 they were trying to get it out.

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,960
 And they wrote in their records that this would be impossible to do yourself.

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
 Like you would need at least two people.

132
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 Apparently they've done this too.

133
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
 They did it at some frat party a long time ago.

134
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
 You would need at least two people to stick this bottle up this dude's butt.

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
 But they are able to remove it.

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,760
 And since the crime's been committed, the authorities come in and, you know,

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,560
 he's been able to tell the doctors, yeah, these two Albanian dudes walked up.

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,480
 They stuck this Coca-Cola bottle up my butthole.

139
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
 But now the investigators are talking to him.

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,360
 And you had the, you had a colonel of the army, of the Yugoslav people's army come in

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,320
 and he's talking to him and he's like, hey, so you want to file a report.

142
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,120
 You want to see these Albanians shove this Coke bottle up your butthole

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
 and they're getting the report.

144
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,560
 And the police actually, as this dude's talking to him,

145
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
 the police start to suspect that this story's not true.

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,040
 I mean, he clearly did have a bottle in his bum.

147
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
 But they don't think that two Albanians did it.

148
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
 Stuff's not sitting right with them.

149
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,000
 One, the fact that he kept requesting more Coke bottles during the interview,

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,920
 he's like, oh, I'm so thirsty.

151
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:31,920
 Glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig glig gl

152
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:52,960
 And then he like, said it on the chair.

153
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
 And so I was in the field, you know, it was a long day of work.

154
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
 I had worked hard.

155
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
 Time for a break.

156
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,880
 I took the bottle and I stuck a big stick in the ground.

157
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,560
 And then I put the bottle, the open part on the stick.

158
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
 And then I sat, I forced myself to sit down on the bottle.

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,200
 And I started masturbating.

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,560
 And then the bottle got stuck in my butthole.

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
 The police take that report.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
 They're like, okay, that's kind of what we thought, right?

163
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
 And the authorities bring in another team of doctors.

164
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,600
 And the team of doctors knowing this now,

165
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
 say, you know what, that actually wouldn't make sense.

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,760
 Like based on the circumference, they're looking at this inflamed butthole.

167
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,960
 They go, based on that story and the stuff we're seeing,

168
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,840
 he did it himself.

169
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
 He stuck a stick in the ground.

170
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
 He forced it in.

171
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,720
 It got stuck.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,520
 It's unfortunate.

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,800
 So case closed.

174
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,080
 Right?

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
 The authorities go, listen, nine times out of 10

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,160
 when something is in your butthole, you put it there.

177
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
 Right?

178
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
 I don't know if that's an actual police statistic,

179
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,840
 but they figured that's what happened.

180
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,160
 And so you're going, Jason, what does any of this have to do

181
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
 with the destruction of the country of Yugoslavia?

182
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
 He said Albanians did it.

183
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
 And I get that probably caused a bunch of hate crimes

184
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,960
 or something like that.

185
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,800
 But now he's clearly admitting that it was a lie,

186
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
 that he just wanted to get a hard on in the middle of his field,

187
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
 sat on a Coca-Cola bottle.

188
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
 It's really interesting because he gets,

189
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,640
 the police do say, listen, we're not going to investigate this.

190
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
 He actually confessed that he did it himself.

191
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,080
 He then, once he's relieved from police interrogation,

192
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
 once he has a nice cold bottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
 he says, oh no, no, no, no, no, I lied to the cops.

194
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,640
 I told the truth the first time.

195
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,240
 I lied to the cops because they told me if I said this,

196
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,880
 that my children will be given government jobs.

197
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
 So I actually told the truth the first time,

198
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
 lied the second time, truthfully, the Albanians did it.

199
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,040
 These two Albanian dudes held me down,

200
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,360
 stuck a Coke bottle in my butthole.

201
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
 What's so fascinating about this, right,

202
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
 is the media ran with this story.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
 And they took the story of this guy who most likely stuck it

204
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,920
 up his own butthole.

205
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,680
 But they were like, this is, we all knew Albanians were bad all along.

206
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
 At any point, you, you simple young men there,

207
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
 could be working in the fields,

208
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
 and a bunch of Albanians will show up,

209
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,400
 start sticking stuff up your butthole.

210
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,720
 In fact, they've stuck stuff up all of our buttholes.

211
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
 Us as Orthodox Christians,

212
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
 we all have a giant Coke bottle in our butthole right now.

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,800
 And they ran with this as a culture war.

214
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
 And this is so interesting.

215
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,080
 They were comparing the Albanians to the atrocities of Vlad the Impaler,

216
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,440
 the atrocities of the Turkish Empire,

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,240
 who famously impaled their political opponents.

218
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
 There were poems written about this dude.

219
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
 There were poems owed to a Coke bottle in Mayanus.

220
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,640
 There were poems written about this man who was defiled.

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,680
 It came to the point where there was a painting of

222
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,640
 Dorday Martinovic crucified on a cross.

223
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,080
 And instead of a Roman soldier, there's no joke.

224
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
 I'm not making this up.

225
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,080
 They had a painting of him crucified on a cross.

226
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,880
 And instead of a Roman soldier holding a spear,

227
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,840
 like in the portrait of Jesus on the cross,

228
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,280
 it's the drawing of an Albanian holding a Coca-Cola bottle.

229
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,120
 Again, this is the absolutely worst product placement.

230
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,760
 He's holding a Coke or soda bottle, technically.

231
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
 And I don't think they actually said what brand it was.

232
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,680
 I just have Coke on my mind.

233
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,080
 There's a painting of him crucified

234
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
 and an Albanian holding a Coke bottle.

235
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,520
 Historians think that this was one of the preceding events to the Serbian Kosovo War,

236
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 where you had the Orthodox Christians

237
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
 and the Albanians killing each other in the streets.

238
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
 Like, this was one of the preceding events.

239
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
 It wasn't the last straw before the Yugoslavian Civil War,

240
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
 but it was one of the straws, right?

241
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,760
 It was one of those things that when people were finally loading up guns

242
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,800
 to go out and kill people, this was something that was on their mind.

243
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,920
 We let the Albanians stick a Coke bottle up this dude's butthole.

244
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
 Now it's time to go take back the land.

245
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,840
 Super weird.

246
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,320
 And I find it fascinating that history,

247
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
 when we read history books, it seems to just pivot quickly,

248
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
 like this happened and this happened,

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,560
 but there's all these other little factors leading up to it.

250
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
 Fascinating story, right?

251
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
 History just the way history works.

252
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,840
 And because of this, you had a bunch of emotions running high

253
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,440
 and you were able to base it off of old sins, right?

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,080
 What the Ottoman Empire was doing to the Serbians

255
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
 and stuff that was going on right now.

256
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
 And what's weird is he probably did it himself, right?

257
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
 He probably, the whole time this Civil War breaks out,

258
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,840
 he's like, "Ah, I probably should have just admitted

259
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
 that I like stuff up my butt when I masturbate

260
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
 as buildings are getting blown up and he's watching tanks."

261
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
 He's like, "I guess this is a little too late for that now though."

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,120
 Vizelhorn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

263
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
 We're leaving behind, what's it even called now?

264
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
 Again, it's like a bunch of different countries.

265
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
 We're leaving behind the remnants of Yugoslavia.

266
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,040
 We are headed all the way out to a US national forest.

267
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,760
 [Demonstrates]

268
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,280
 First off, let me say the reason why I'm doing the whole copyright.

269
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,400
 This is copyrighted bit.

270
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,200
 It's David Pauletti's, the guy who created the theory of missing 411,

271
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
 which in a nutshell is people go missing in national parks

272
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,960
 and the government is covering it up.

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,480
 It's kind of hard to find stats for it.

274
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
 When they go missing in national parks, they're either never found

275
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,400
 or their body is found in some remote location

276
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,920
 that they couldn't have gotten to normally,

277
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,360
 like a three-year-old boy being found on the cliff face with his shoe

278
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
 and like a crevice.

279
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
 And it's this mysterious stuff.

280
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
 The original theory was Bigfoot was doing this.

281
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,960
 And that got pushed to the side because Bigfoot just is...

282
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,000
 That's kind of a lame theory for Bigfoot to say,

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
 "Oh, me Bigfoot, me throw your shoe on cliff."

284
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,080
 It doesn't really capture the imagination.

285
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,160
 What's really interesting is by the time missing 411 got popular,

286
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,760
 the books were out of print.

287
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960
 He came out with these books.

288
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,040
 They kind of landed with a thud, honestly.

289
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
 I had never heard of them for years and years.

290
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,400
 Mysterious Universe covered them and they became super famous.

291
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,120
 And now, David Pauletti's has this weird quirk

292
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,480
 when he watches YouTube videos.

293
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,640
 He walks out on screen and he goes, "Hi, my name's David Pauletti."

294
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,160
 He pronounces his name correctly.

295
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
 He does pronounce it correctly.

296
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,960
 He goes, "Hi, I'm David Pauletti's and this is a copyrighted video."

297
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,800
 You're like, "What?"

298
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,840
 Because people are so often referencing his stuff that he says,

299
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,000
 "This is copyrighted so you can't reference the video."

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,440
 It's absolutely bizarre.

301
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
 You can't copyright a fact.

302
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,960
 You just...

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
 People do that to my show.

304
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,400
 Every show often people send me YouTube videos

305
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,240
 or I stumble across YouTube videos

306
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
 where they'll take the research I did and present it as their own.

307
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
 You can't copyright a fact.

308
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,080
 I can get all the articles in the world and tell the most amazing story.

309
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,760
 And then you take that same story and you tell it and just rearrange the words.

310
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's a factual.

311
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,040
 I don't think you can copyright a theory because I've had,

312
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
 when I say let's put on a conspiracy cap and wrap this episode up

313
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
 and I'll kind of come up with a theory.

314
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
 My own theory, people will take those too.

315
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,200
 Whatever, right?

316
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
 You can't copyright it.

317
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,120
 So if David Pauletti is listening to this episode,

318
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,000
 you can't copyright it.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,720
 It's weird that you say that.

320
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
 And I copyright this episode so you can't listen to it.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
 But no, so we have this Missing411 thing

322
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,760
 and we have David Pauletti's.

323
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,120
 He's quite the character himself.

324
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
 I don't wish him any ill will, but he's just so weird when he doesn't.

325
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,240
 He doesn't like people cribbing his notes.

326
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
 So this is really awkward for me because I copyrighted this episode too.

327
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,960
 David Pauletti's has never really put forth an idea of what's causing Missing411.

328
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,720
 Again, sometimes Bigfoot is throwing around as for doing this,

329
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
 but he's never really had a theory.

330
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
 But I came across someone who does.

331
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
 Someone who has figured out the mystery of Missing411.

332
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
 And this guy's not copyrighting it either.

333
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
 This guy's letting everyone have it for free.

334
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,120
 This guy may be the hero humanity needs.

335
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,240
 He's a super soldier.

336
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,080
 He's a psychic.

337
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,040
 And he may also be wanted for the murder of a Nevada state trooper as we covered last week.

338
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,160
 It's Kevin Whiskey.

339
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,520
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Kevin Whiskey coming in here.

340
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,240
 I kind of went hard on him about a week ago, accusing him of an unsolved murder.

341
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,720
 But now Kevin Whiskey may have solved Missing411.

342
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,360
 So Kevin Whiskey is a man.

343
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,200
 Kevin Whiskey is a legend.

344
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,760
 And he has the ability to remote view where he sits there and he closes his eyes and he pretends

345
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,880
 he just stay dreams.

346
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
 He just stay dreams right.

347
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
 And then he comes back with the answer.

348
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,560
 June 20th, 2019, Kevin Whiskey wrote this in his blog,

349
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,400
 MightInMagic.com, who let him get that URL?

350
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,440
 That is great, dude.

351
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,480
 I think every dungeon master in America should be punished for letting him snack that one.

352
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,960
 He's sitting there and he's going to remote review Yosemite National Park.

353
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,440
 Originally, he's just trying to view the deep underground military base.

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
 Or as no one in conspiracy land, dumbs.

355
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,480
 Kevin Whiskey has infiltrated his spirit, has infiltrated the Yosemite National Park

356
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,000
 underground military base.

357
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,480
 Really, really bad security there, by the way.

358
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,960
 I bet your astral guards were sleeping that day.

359
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,240
 Actually, I don't even know why I'm making fun because he almost did get caught, right?

360
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
 I shouldn't say that they don't have good security.

361
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,560
 As his spirit is floating through the military base,

362
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,120
 he starts to sense an inhuman presence.

363
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
 He's like, huh, what?

364
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,640
 He turns around and walking down the hallway was an insectoid alien.

365
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
 Those are my favorites.

366
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,640
 So he's looking at this insectoid alien and the alien is kind of like looking around.

367
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,320
 And then it's looking right at Kevin.

368
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
 And Kevin's just kind of floating there with little Casper, little Casper legs.

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,080
 He's like, ah, the insectoid somehow could tell a spirit had invaded the base.

370
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,280
 So he's floating around and this insectoid alien's walking behind him.

371
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
 So he's like, I better go somewhere.

372
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,560
 So he floats through a couple walls and ends up in a meeting room.

373
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,800
 And he sees the plans for Operation Deep Seed.

374
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,360
 And he's like, ah.

375
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
 Now he's a ghost, right?

376
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
 He's an astral guy.

377
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,200
 So now that I'm thinking about it, it's not like he could rifle through their papers.

378
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,160
 All of these papers must have just been laid out perfectly one after another on the table,

379
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,640
 just in case ghosts came in to see him because he's able to gleam all this information.

380
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,760
 First off, Operation Deep Seed is a operation to preserve the human culture.

381
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,160
 They're basically building a human ant farm, which makes sense why there's an insectoid there.

382
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,280
 Because they know they know their way around the ant farms.

383
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
 They're like, step one, get lots and lots of sugar just for me.

384
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,200
 Operation Deep Seed is this.

385
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,560
 Kidnap civilians and you take them to a hidden location.

386
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,040
 Now preferably, humans with German ancestry.

387
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,920
 This is something that isn't talked a lot about when you hear just overviews of Missing 411.

388
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
 I hadn't heard this detail.

389
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,400
 But Missing 411, when you go missing in the forest, it's almost always people of German descent.

390
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,320
 I never heard that piece of trivia, but that's straight from David Pauletti's as well.

391
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,200
 So it's snatching people up, preferably Germans, and taking them to a remote location.

392
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,720
 Now it wants to take a bunch of Germans, but it knows it's a human ant farm.

393
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 If you only had Germans there, you could only reproduce so many times.

394
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,920
 And then eventually the babies are going to be all, you have to have more diverse gene pool.

395
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,760
 Apparently, I don't know how the nation of Germany lasted this long.

396
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 Apparently Germans cannot have kids with other Germans more than a couple generations.

397
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
 But anyways, so they also kidnap people.

398
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
 It's very diverse.

399
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
 This is very, very inclusive.

400
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,440
 They kidnap people of all races.

401
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,360
 They want a bunch of Germans there, but you know, they need to have like all these different races

402
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,560
 and ethnic groups as well.

403
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,160
 So you go, okay, now we've solved what's happening to these people.

404
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
 How are they getting kidnapped?

405
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,960
 Because the whole thing about missing four and one is like you turn away for like just a minute

406
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,800
 or two and you turn back and your kid's gone.

407
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,880
 Your German ancestry kid is gone.

408
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,160
 That's when he discovered Operation Barnow.

409
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,960
 There also happened to be another set of documents all laid out perfectly for him to read to this.

410
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,080
 Operation Barnow, it's these drones.

411
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,720
 It's these highly polished, reflective steel drones that fly around the national parks.

412
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,440
 You never see these, you remember when you went to the national park?

413
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
 You're like, hey honey, look, giant metal drone overhead.

414
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,480
 What happens is they fly around looking for Germans, looking for people of German ancestry.

415
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,040
 Apparently has facial recognition because the government has picked you out before you even

416
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,920
 knew you were spaying, before you knew anything special about you.

417
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,840
 You go into the park and this Barnow giant drone, human sized drone by the way, right?

418
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,680
 These things are like six feet tall.

419
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,720
 They fly around and they go, facial match, that is Joseph Rodriguez.

420
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,760
 I want him and then the robot or the drone or whatever picks you up, takes you somewhere.

421
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,720
 So they pick you out ahead of time and now I would assume, like what if they picked me

422
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,160
 and I hate going outdoors?

423
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,880
 Do I win two tickets to Yosemite?

424
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,400
 Like am I going to get a letter in the mail tomorrow and it's like, wow, two free tickets

425
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
 to a place that I'm pretty sure is free to get into.

426
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
 Then they get me?

427
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,320
 I don't know.

428
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
 But anyways, these things fly around.

429
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,480
 They're targeting specific people.

430
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,280
 They scoop you up and then they spray knockout gas in your face, which is a kind of extreme,

431
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,440
 right?

432
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
 I'm already trapped in a metal flying device.

433
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,840
 I'm not going to break my way out and go, you'll never catch me now as I plummet to my death.

434
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,040
 They knock you out with gas.

435
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,560
 You're brought to, again, I keep saying this location.

436
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
 This is really interesting.

437
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
 I'm so glad that Kevin Whiskey has avoided,

438
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,120
 captured by the authorities for that unsolved murder.

439
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,720
 So he could tell us this information.

440
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:48,000
 Apparently these barn owls, they take all of us to a remote and fairly hostile location.

441
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,160
 I'm assuming mostly in downtown Detroit.

442
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,920
 And you are now hanging out with a bunch of people that you've never met before.

443
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,080
 And you have to survive.

444
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,000
 So I would be dropped there and there would be a bunch of other people.

445
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,680
 They say about a hundred of us, right?

446
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,120
 And it would be super cold.

447
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,920
 And then there's wind blowing in our face.

448
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,440
 And then people would be like, build a shelter and someone else is like,

449
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
 no, we got to figure out a way out of here.

450
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,400
 And the watchers see how this community develops.

451
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,040
 And if this group of hundred people who have been all been kidnapped,

452
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,920
 no one knows what the plan is, they're all dropped off in this location.

453
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,040
 If they survive, then they will be welcomed into the human ant colony.

454
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,520
 If they tear themselves apart and become tribal and break up and all this stuff.

455
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,280
 And like there's like three different groups and then the German ancestry groups taking us over.

456
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,000
 We're like, no, they will just all be killed.

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,440
 They'll be left in that remote location till everyone dies.

458
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,520
 So it's not like if you did have one group like bandied together

459
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
 and fight off all the other groups and be like, we won.

460
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,640
 There's only 20 of us left, but we are all from California or whatever.

461
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
 They're not going to let you in the human ant colony,

462
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,040
 because obviously you're too tribal.

463
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,120
 You have to work together no matter what background, religion, ethnic group, anything like that.

464
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
 That's a really, really interesting point.

465
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
 I'm glad he was able to float around and see that document.

466
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,080
 Definitely an interesting story.

467
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
 This is a really interesting story idea.

468
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,520
 Like I could see that if, if, I mean, he's not making this up.

469
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
 I don't know why I'm saying this.

470
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
 Any of this is fictional.

471
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's coming from a super soldier.

472
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
 It's obviously true.

473
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,640
 But if you wanted to write a novel, I think it'd be kind of cool.

474
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,920
 I think that's kind of a cool story.

475
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,360
 He tried floating around more.

476
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,040
 He tried floating deeper into the base,

477
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,040
 but that is where they actually do start to have some sort of psychic barricades.

478
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,200
 You know, somebody who's like, well, if you want to be a ghost and float around,

479
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
 we'll let you look at all these documents, but you can't float any lower.

480
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,160
 You can only look at this part.

481
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,360
 So that was the end of his dream.

482
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,960
 I mean, I mean, that was the end of his remote viewing experience.

483
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
 He also, at the very end of his story, he kind of throws this in, right?

484
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,320
 Because he has Operation Barnow and Operation Deep Seed.

485
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 Apparently there's a third way cooler operation going on.

486
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
 It's called Operation Red Stalker.

487
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,880
 And that also operates apparently in the national parks,

488
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
 where instead of some drone lame Operation Red Stalker,

489
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,000
 identify target.

490
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,440
 There he is.

491
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
 Carpenter, comma, Jason.

492
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,480
 Copyrighted an episode from David Paul Eddys.

493
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
 Cyborgs, dude.

494
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,600
 Human bioengineered cyborgs.

495
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,920
 E-e-e-e-e-e-oh.

496
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,200
 Root entry, tripping, tripping.

497
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,480
 I don't know how effective a cyborg would be in a forest, right?

498
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,080
 You're just like walking on the trail and you hear e-e-e-e-e.

499
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,040
 And you turn around, it's just like this really slow 1980s film cyborg following you.

500
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,000
 You're like, "Ah!"

501
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,160
 Then you step slightly off the trail and you go over a couple bushes and something that's like,

502
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,240
 "Ah, cannot, cannot get you.

503
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,200
 Mulberry bush, my greatest weakness."

504
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
 That would be dope though if I was going to get chased by a cyborg.

505
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,160
 I hope it's a part of something called Operation Red Stalker and not Operation Coca-Cola Bottle.

506
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,720
 Because then I know what that cyborg really wants to do to me.

507
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,280
 Cyborgs, bioengineered cyborgs.

508
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,720
 Maybe they don't move that slow, but that's still dope, right?

509
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
 Again, if I'm going to get kidnapped, please let a cyborg be part of it.

510
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,680
 So there we go.

511
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,160
 I think this is actually out of all the theories we have of Missing 411.

512
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,680
 Really, we have that Bigfoot.

513
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,800
 That was the original theories.

514
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,720
 These are all caused by Bigfoot's.

515
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,680
 Secondly, I've heard that human US soldiers are wearing camouflage suits

516
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,320
 and running around the national parks and kidnapping them.

517
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
 And my push back to that always was, why there?

518
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,240
 Like if you had the ability to kidnap people,

519
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
 why you might test it in America, but wouldn't it be better for you to be invisible in like

520
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,040
 another country and kidnap them?

521
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,400
 Right?

522
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,240
 Go over to where those are kidnapping presidents and prime ministers.

523
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,640
 You're like all of a sudden you see Vladimir Putin giving a speech and then he just kind of vanishes.

524
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
 Right?

525
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,160
 That would be dope.

526
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
 Not for the world.

527
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,360
 I'm sure that would cause massive chaos throughout Eastern Europe, but it'd be fine for us.

528
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,800
 That's what I'd never understood.

529
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,480
 You could train them here for a while,

530
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,640
 but you would figure at this point they're being visible to people all over the world.

531
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,080
 This one makes more sense.

532
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
 Right?

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,640
 Humans being kidnapped, being tested, so only the best of the best.

534
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,120
 And really when we say best, the most survival focused and the most team focused.

535
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,520
 You don't want to be trapped in a human ant farm with a bunch of people who can't work together.

536
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
 So Kevin Whiskey, thank you for your service, man.

537
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,440
 I really appreciate it.

538
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,280
 When you do get arrested for murdering that police officer, I'll stand at your trial.

539
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,440
 Like I will actually be a character witness for you.

540
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
 Play this podcast.

541
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,320
 I'll make sure a bunch of people are there to get free publicity for the podcast.

542
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,040
 And I will go on the stand and I'll go, "Your Honor, listen,

543
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,560
 I know that he took that screwdriver and he brutally killed that man that he thought was a member of the men in black,

544
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,520
 or a child that he beat to death with a baseball bat."

545
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm sorry, I'm putting so much in jokes in there.

546
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,840
 You can check out that last episode, but "Your Honor, like I know he's done all that horrible stuff,

547
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,160
 but he also told us what was underneath Yosemite.

548
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,080
 He told us about missing 411."

549
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,200
 So I think that should easily get this dude off.

550
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
 And at that point, the judge, he turns.

551
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,320
 He was a cyborg the whole time.

552
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
 This trial went on for six weeks.

553
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,520
 I didn't even notice that every time he moved, every time he picks up the gavel and went,

554
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,600
 "Een, een, een, een."

555
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,240
 Anyways, now that we know what causes missing 411, we can stop it.

556
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
 We can stop it.

557
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,080
 I suggest that the next time you go to a national park, you break out your leaderhosen,

558
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,000
 get a big old beer stein, and walk around singing old Himalayan songs or Alps songs, whatever.

559
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
 You know the ones that the Ricola guy does?

560
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,040
 Just walk around.

561
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,240
 Just be a nuisance.

562
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
 Just be a general nuisance.

563
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
 Because then that drone's going to come after you.

564
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
 And you're going to get kidnapped.

565
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,720
 And then you will...

566
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
 I guess this isn't a great plan, because you're going to be put in some hostile location.

567
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
 But then we'll finally know the truth.

568
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,480
 Make sure you have your cell phone on you or something.

569
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,880
 I don't know.

570
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,080
 Make sure you have a ball of yarn, and you tie it to a tree.

571
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,360
 So when the drone carries you off, it's unspooling yarn the whole way.

572
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,280
 Get kidnapped is what I'm saying.

573
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,720
 Prove that missing 411 is really a human ant form.

574
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,960
 And then we can break the system.

575
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,880
 We can destroy the matrix.

576
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,920
 You and me together.

577
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,240
 Well, technically, technically it's just you, because you're the one getting kidnapped.

578
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,320
 But Kevin Whiskey, thank you so much for risking your astral body for our knowledge.

579
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,960
 It's men like you that ensure that we have the freedom of speech.

580
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,200
 The freedom to float.

581
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
 The freedom to float wherever we're at.

582
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
 And the freedom to copyright things.

583
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,200
 Even things that can't be copyrighted.

584
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,680
 Ooooah Kevin Whiskey.

585
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,440
 Ooooah.
