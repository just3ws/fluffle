1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Unidentified chunks of meat rain down from the skies.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 And then we take a look at the Falk Monster from Falk, Arkansas.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 I think that's how you pronounce it. It's one of those episodes.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,000
 Was a giant ape-like beast terrorizing the people of that town I can barely pronounce?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 Or was it something far more sinister today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you are having a great day too.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It's 9 degrees.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm recording this in the morning and it is 9 degrees and fun fact,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 because I'm sure a long time listeners of the podcast know I can't run my heater during this time.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,500
 So let's go ahead and get started. And if I never release another episode, I have died of exposure in my own apartment.

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 So the first story we're going to cover is actually from the conspiracy iceberg.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 And it's one that is not super well known. I think the phenomenon is well known, but usually it's in other things.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 There's been reports even today. Not actually literally today, but even in modern times.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,000
 There's reports of just fish falling in the middle of the plains of Idaho,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 or a bunch of, I don't know, octopuses falling all over the desert.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And basically what it is, is they're water spouts that suck up a bunch of water and fish are like,

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 "Ahh, it's like the worst alternate ending to find the Nemo you can imagine."

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And they all just get dumped, like 50 fish just get dumped in the middle of nowhere.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So you're walking through the forest and you just see a bunch of fish laying on the ground and they're dead.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
 And you're like, "Oh, that sucks."

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 But you know, well actually you'd probably be like, "That's quite mysterious.

23
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 I don't think you would automatically just feel sorry for the fish."

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 But that's a known phenomenon. It's really weird because that's where how a lot of plant life gets seeded to islands are these water spouts.

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 And even animals, little bugs, have gotten sucked up in these water spouts.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 And then dropped off in an island and they're like, "This is our new home, family."

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 And then they were like, "How did this type of mosquito get to this island from a water spout?"

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
 But we're not talking about water spouts today.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,500
 The year is 1876.

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:34,000
 America had been founded for 100 years already and things were going great other than that civil war that just ended not too long ago.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,500
 We're in Bath County, Kentucky.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 So a bunch of little Kentuckians running around doing stuff and thatched huts just living off the land.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 One day there's a farmer out there smoking his corn cob pipe, thinking of some day of starting a feed and seed store.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 But today he's just trying to enjoy the good weather.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 Thump, thump, thump, thump.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 The farmer's like, "What in the world? What in Taurination is that?"

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 And he starts to see bloody chunky pieces of flesh and meat fall from the sky.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 Thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 [Makes a sound of a gun]

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 It covered an area by 100 yards by 50 yards, so quite sizable.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 Now the whole thing wasn't covered in glop. It wasn't like you couldn't walk. You couldn't see the ground.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 But there was bloody chunks everywhere. It just spread out everywhere.

44
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 Now of course, what are you gonna do? You're gonna call your friends. They didn't have phones back then, so he just like ran to town and said, "Hey guys, you gotta come check this out.

45
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 There's a bunch of bloody meat all over my lawn."

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 So they all show up. And they sure enough, it's still there. It's still bloody. It's still fleshy.

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 It's still pretty gross. So what do you do? It's 1876. You're curious. You wanna know what this is?

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 So they started eating it to figure out what it was. They started eating it. Now they go, "Okay, that's disgusting."

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,500
 Like, I think it's gross enough. Like, people still eat roadkill, but I get it. It's a survival thing, and you know, you cook it and you're fine.

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 But if a bunch of meat mysteriously fell from the heavens, I'd be thinking maybe an angel got caught.

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 They didn't even have plans back then. I was thinking maybe an angel got blown up. Someone threw some dynamite up, blew it to some of the rings.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 But anyways, they started eating it. And basically, there was a bunch of disagreements. Some people said, "It tastes like lamb."

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 It tastes a lot like lamb. Another guy's like, "No, no, no, no. This is deer meat. This is definitely deer meat."

54
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 And one guy, a famous hunter in the area, said, "No, I know exactly what it is. It's bear. It has to be bear. I've eaten bear my entire life. I was eating bear in the womb.

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 My mom put a teddy bear up there. I ate it. This is bear."

56
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 They did take it eventually to get tested by some old-timey scientists, so they had beakers and stuff like that and bubbling little vials.

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 And they tested it, and they came back. They said, "It's lung tissue." And all the hunters and everyone who tasted it was like, "Hmm. Yeah."

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 And the scientist goes, "It's lung tissue of either a horse and everyone's like, 'What?' Or a human baby."

59
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 All the hunters throw up. A human baby. Now, apparently, their lungs are similar in material like the way their lungs are.

60
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 And here's the thing. So the old-timey scientists and the modern-day scientists felt that what happened was,

61
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 and again, this puts eating and eating it into a new perspective, they think that some vultures ate something,

62
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 and then when vultures are scared, they vomit up the food that they ate so they can fly away quicker.

63
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 Now, I've never tried that particularly myself. I've never been eating a McDonald's and a bunch of hoodlums running,

64
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 and I'm like, "Gotta go." And just like bounce out the back door. But apparently, that's a survival mechanism for vultures.

65
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 Maybe we should try it. Maybe we'd get out of more sticky situations that are like slipping on the vomit.

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 But they said it was vultures throwing it up. So these people may have eaten human baby and they may have eaten vulture vomit,

67
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 but the debunking to the debunking is that vultures only weigh up to six pounds in America.

68
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 And there was a ton of meat there. Like, there was more meat than you would have to have a flock of vultures,

69
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 which, you know, they are social creatures in America. So who knows? That's a Kentucky meat storm.

70
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 But what's odd is nine days after the Kentucky meat storm, it happened again in London.

71
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 A bunch of meat just fell from the sky. But that small potatoes, or that small chunks of baby lung compared to what happened in 1968.

72
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 So now we are in modern times. We've got much better scientific techniques.

73
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
 People aren't walking around picking up meat, just eating it. So, you know, we're good. We're solid. It's 1968.

74
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 We're in the Periba Valley in Brazil. Periba Valley. And it's August 15th.

75
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 There's a police officer just driving around on his motorcycle, running a siren for no reason. He's in the middle of nowhere.

76
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 Comes across a field of blood and meat. One square kilometer of blood and meat.

77
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 Stops his motorcycle. Looking everywhere. Looking for a bunch of, like, body parts. There's nothing there. Just little chunks of meat. Blood.

78
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 So anyways, so the police officer is like, this is disgusting. Like, I'm used to seeing, like, gross stuff, but not, like, just mysterious gross stuff. That's different.

79
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 Now, he obviously starts talking to people. He's like, hey, dude, what's up with all this blood in your field? And they're like, we saw it. The locals were like, we saw it.

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 Happened. Cops like, okay, what happened there? Like, it came from the sky. What?

81
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 Yeah, we were at work. There was a ton of reports in this area. People were at work. I think these, some of them were like brick layers, and some people were just doing their laundry.

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 And all of a sudden droplets of blood started falling and huge chunks of meat. When I say huge, they're about the size of, like, a quarter or a little bit bigger.

83
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 And they weren't, like, flank steaks falling down in rump roast. But any size of meat falling from the sky is too large to fall on you.

84
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 People, locals were like, yeah, dude, we're just working. All of a sudden, I looked down, my hand was covered in blood. I look up. Chunks of meat are falling at me.

85
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 We all ran inside. Women were doing their laundry. They're like, ah, gotta do my laundry again. No planes flew by.

86
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 They're like, listen, man, where we're at, there's no planes. We're not in any sort of flight path or anything like that.

87
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 We don't know what could have caused that because people are like, well, maybe like a plane hit a goose or like a whole flock of geese chopped them all up, turned them into meat.

88
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 And people are like, there's no planes. We're not in a flight path. We didn't see a plane. We didn't hear a plane. Just a bunch of blood started falling down.

89
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 And actually this one, they were the size of small steaks. So yeah, probably a little bit, probably about the size of your hand.

90
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 They were spongy and purplish. So that makes me think more lung because lungs do tend to be purple.

91
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 But it was a mystery. People were like, well, we found all this meat, all this blood fell down. That's super spooky. People thought it was the end of the world, obviously.

92
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 25 days later, same valley, noon. It's a nice sunny day. It's 12pm. I can't see my shadow. This is cool.

93
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:12,500
 This is always the best part of my day when my shadow disappears because they scare me. But instead of shadows, more blood.

94
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 It just comes out of the sky. Blood and meat begins raining down. It's always the blood first, which is weird. The blood comes down first.

95
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 It lasted 3-4 minutes this time. And when they were able to collect all the meat, it weighed a total of 3.5 pounds of meat.

96
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 It's just... falling everywhere. So they take it to the scientists. So they take it to the scientists and they're like, what is this stuff falling on us?

97
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:54,500
 And the scientists are like, hmm... This is odd. It's very specific in one thing, but then they didn't really know. They said it's heart and kidneys, most likely heart and kidneys, of a female mammal.

98
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 That was as good as they could get. Human, goat, who knows. Any female mammal. So I thought it was weird that they were able to determine the sex of the chunks, but not exactly what they were, but they said most likely heart and kidneys.

99
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 Now, these guys weren't eating them. They're like, this stuff is purple and gross and it's falling from the sky. We think at the end of the world we're not going to eat angel flesh.

100
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 But they still don't know what causes us. Again, the explanation in the old time was vultures. And when you look at articles on this, they'll be like, oh, this was debunked. It was just vultures.

101
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 But the amount of vultures you would need to spit up 100 yards worth of meat and blood is quite a lot.

102
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 And then in the Brazil story in 1968, they said, yeah, birds might be throwing up, a plane might hit something, but the locals are like, no, that stuff didn't happen.

103
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 And then science just goes, oh, well, then don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. It is weird that it happened twice within a month in Brazil in the same area.

104
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 So what is causing meat to fall from the sky? Nobody knows. Tons of different answers. Tons of different questions.

105
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 It's what it would be. This would be what would be chilling. Imagine you were a serial killer in another country. You're like chopping up your victim.

106
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 And you're like, now I just have to dispose of this body and then a water spout sucks him out. Now I guess you would have to be near the ocean to do that or like killing people on a boat.

107
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 But what a great way to dispose of bodies. Just go to a place where there's a bunch of water spouts and you're like, throw them in the water.

108
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 And then you just sail away before the water spout gets you as well. Who knows? Who knows what's happening? It is a mystery.

109
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 It is definitely a strange occurrence that happens on this planet and people tried to bunk in it.

110
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 But the fact is that at any point you could be walking down the street and all of a sudden blood and meat start falling on you.

111
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 My one piece of advice, it may be human baby, so please, please, please don't eat it. Just leave it on the ground.

112
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 Our next story that we're going to talk about is the, I think it's Fouk, Fouk monster.

113
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 We're going to keep calling it the Boggy Creek monster because that's much easier to pronounce.

114
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 But we're going to the town. We have to say it one last time here. We're going to the town of Fouk, Arkansas.

115
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 It's 1971 and this young couple has just moved into a new house.

116
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 It's Bobby Ford and Elizabeth Ford. They're the couple.

117
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 And then Bobby's brother and sister-in-law are staying in the house for this week.

118
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 They're like, "Yeah, this is pretty awesome. Yeah, this kind of neat house around the middle of nowhere. It's kind of cool."

119
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 Hey, did you hear it? Reading the news about the thing a couple years ago where all that meat fell from the sky?

120
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 "Yeah, yeah, I heard that. I think an angel got blown up." "Yeah, me too."

121
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 So anyways, the boys go out hunting. They load up their rifles. We're going to go kill some deer.

122
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 And they leave the women at home. The women at home while their husbands are out hunting, they're just like, "You know what? Let's take a nap."

123
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 You know, something might have happened between the two women because it's dark and cold and they're alone.

124
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 You know, you got to keep warm. You got to warm each other sometimes. You got to get a little close, ladies.

125
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 You got to just... It's just an experiment. You're just experimenting. There's nothing wrong with it.

126
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 But anyways, these two women eventually do fall asleep. Why would they fall asleep in the middle? Okay, but anyways, anyways.

127
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 They're out hunting. The two women fall asleep mysteriously in the living room at the same time, hint, hint.

128
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 And Elizabeth Ford is sleeping in the living room. And now she wakes up to a noise.

129
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 And a noise that she doesn't expect to hear. Well, not now. She might have heard it earlier. But she hears the sound of heavy breathing.

130
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 She looks at her sister-in-law. She's still asleep. She's like, "Oh, well, I must rocked her world."

131
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 But she still hears the heavy breathing and it's coming from outside the house.

132
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 And at that point, she sees something outside of her front window.

133
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 Now, the front window is open. It's just a screen now. You know, because you got to let the passion leak out of the house before your husband comes back.

134
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 But anyways, she's asleep in there. She's awake now. And she sees through the screen window a large creature.

135
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 A large creature that she describes is seven feet tall and three feet wide. So quite massive.

136
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 Basically, a giant linebacker is standing outside of her house. She just hears it.

137
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 Huge red eyes staring at her. She's like, "What the hell is that thing?"

138
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 And then giant paw pushes through the screen that easily pops off because a baby can push the screen off.

139
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 And it had these massive three claws on it. And it begins kind of like sweeping the couch, like looking for something that might be laying on the couch.

140
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 It's detecting the sense of sweet, sweet, forbidden love making and it's just trying to grab something, but there's nothing there.

141
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 The passion has moved on. The creature.

142
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 [Groans]

143
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 So of course, at this point, Elizabeth is screaming her head off, which I'm not going to do in the podcast,

144
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
 because a lot of people listen to this podcast while they're sleeping.

145
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
 But she screams. She goes, she does, she goes, "Ahhhh."

146
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 But just turned the volume up during that point.

147
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 So her husband and her brother-in-law hear the noise.

148
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 They're like, "Oh no, we gotta go back. Like, why is our wife screaming?"

149
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 That was weird. We heard her moaning earlier, but now she's screaming.

150
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 So they run back. I'm glad I've added the lesbian subplot to this.

151
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 The hunters run back to the house and they see the back of this giant monster like reaching into the house trying to grab something.

152
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 And they hear Elizabeth still screaming.

153
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 Oddly enough, the sister-in-law still dead asleep, apparently.

154
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Really must the rocked-ear world.

155
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 The brothers begin to shoot it.

156
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 [Sounds of shooting]

157
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 Creature turns around.

158
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 [Groans]

159
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 And the bolster have absolutely no effect on it.

160
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 So Bobby runs up to the porch to get it.

161
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Now again, we're going to get into the specifics of the story in a second, but something seven feet tall and three feet wide.

162
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 Your best bet is, you know how like when they shoot bullets at Superman and they run out of bullets and they just throw their gun at Superman?

163
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
 This is the equivalent of that.

164
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 You're unloading your hunting rifle into a seven foot tall beast.

165
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 The bolts are having no effect on it.

166
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 So I don't think your best bet is to then engage in hand-to-hand combat with it.

167
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 But Bobby runs up to the porch and the creature tackles him, knocks him to the ground, and then jumps up and runs away.

168
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 It ended up like they found the footprints.

169
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 After Bobby's like, "Oh, that was a stupid idea."

170
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 And he runs in and his wife, his half-dressed wife, is like, "Oh my God, I just saw a monster."

171
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 And he's like, "Did it tear your clothes off too?"

172
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 And she's like, "Uh, yeah, yeah, it tore my clothes off."

173
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 They find these footprints and they're three-toed footprints, like three-toed claws.

174
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 And there's three claw marks.

175
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 Not just like the claws, it's like it had three claws is what I'm trying to say.

176
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 They didn't just find like three different claw marks.

177
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 Like whatever it was had three fingers and three toes, and it ran off into the darkness.

178
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 So immediately it becomes this big story down in the south.

179
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,500
 And they were calling it the Boggy Creek Monster or the Subman Sat Squatch.

180
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 And people are like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, Bigfoot's here, Bigfoot's here, yay, let's hold it up, parade."

181
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 There's a lot of issues with this story.

182
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 People started coming out and saying, "You know, I saw Bigfoot back in 1946 when I was a little boy."

183
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 And then other people were like, "I remember seeing the Bigfoot when I'm back in 1956 when I was a teenager, neckin' with my girlfriend."

184
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 And all this stuff came out.

185
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 But there were no reported sightings of this creature before 1971.

186
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 People said they saw it before 1971, but they didn't report it until after Bobby and Elizabeth Ford had this incident.

187
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 And they moved out of the house afterwards.

188
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 They're like, "We're not going to live here anymore."

189
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 Local authorities, the scientific community said it could have been a mountain lion,

190
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 because we all know how mountain lions are normally seven feet tall and three feet wide.

191
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 Could have been a mountain lion.

192
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 Could have been a small ape.

193
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 Could have been a tiny little ape.

194
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 People, though, were like, "No, no, no, this is Bigfoot."

195
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 And Bobby and Elizabeth, they ended up moving out of the house about a week later.

196
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
 They're like, "We're not living here."

197
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 So let's take a look at the specifics here.

198
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
 One, Bigfoot is generally known as a primate.

199
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 And all the Bigfoot sightings, it is an ape.

200
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 And it has primate feet and primate hands.

201
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 So it leaving three, having three toes and having three claws doesn't match with anything we know about Bigfoot at all.

202
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
 Now, this is a huge Bigfoot story, too, in the South.

203
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 And there's been that movie, The Legend of Boggy Creek, or the Boggy Creek Monster.

204
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 There have been tons of movies about this thing, tons of books written about this thing.

205
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 It's always identified as a Bigfoot-type creature, as a Sasquatch.

206
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 But that, other than the size of the creature, it doesn't match with what we know about Bigfoot.

207
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 It was hairy, too, I guess I should have said that, it was a big ol' hairy creature.

208
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 But the three toes and three fingers do not match anything we know about Bigfoot.

209
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 Even the claws don't really match anything we know about Bigfoot, like big, long claws.

210
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 Don't think it was a mountain lion. I don't think it was an ape.

211
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 Now, there's two ways we can look at this. There's three ways we can look at this.

212
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 One is the most likely scenario. That it's completely fake.

213
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 That Bobby and Elizabeth moved into this house, they immediately realized that they either couldn't afford it, or they didn't like the area.

214
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 They made the story up as an excuse to leave the house.

215
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 That's the most likely scenario.

216
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 The second most likely scenario is that they saw a...

217
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 Well, here, then we'll go to the most unlikely scenario that they saw some sort of giant cryptid that's been undiscovered by science.

218
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 Some sort of creature that's not a Bigfoot, a three-toed, three-clawed creature that can smash into their house.

219
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 But I actually think the truth lies somewhere in between.

220
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 My first inclination was they were just trying to get out of their agreement.

221
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
 They're either their rental agreement or they purchased their house.

222
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 That was my first inclination when I was reading the article.

223
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 But this is what's interesting.

224
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 The three claws kept bugging me as I was reading about it.

225
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 I think it was a giant sloth.

226
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 I think it was a giant sloth.

227
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
 So it's kind of in between a cryptid and a natural answer.

228
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 Now, giant sloths have existed in...

229
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 There are giant sloths today.

230
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 They're just bigger than normal sloths.

231
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 And I guess I should say for you, those of you who don't know,

232
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,500
 a sloth is a creature with three clawed toes and three clawed fingers.

233
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 They're generally pretty slow, so we'll get to that in a second.

234
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 But the giant sloths of America were up to 20 feet tall.

235
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 They were massive creatures.

236
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 And we're talking like prehistoric America.

237
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 But the giant sloths of Arkansas specifically were only 10 feet tall.

238
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 So now we're back into the realm of around 7 feet tall.

239
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 And they're super huge.

240
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 They're very bulky creatures.

241
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 They move really, really slow.

242
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 And I get that.

243
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 And I know this one ran away.

244
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 But I think it's most likely that these people didn't see a bigfoot, mythical bigfoot creature.

245
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 I think it's possible that they saw one of the last remnants of a 7 foot tall sloth of that area.

246
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 That they were out in the boonies and this giant sloth came out of nowhere.

247
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 And if you saw the back of it, you would think, oh my god, it's a giant bigfoot.

248
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 You'd basically think that is a monster.

249
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 Because how often do humans come in contact with things bigger than them?

250
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 Bears are really in America.

251
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 Bears are really, oh, I guess elk too, in Giant Deer.

252
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 But you know what I mean?

253
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 Like a bipedal creature that's bigger than you, they're incredibly rare on this planet.

254
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 Wait, are they?

255
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 You have sea fighters.

256
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 And then bears and then giant sloths.

257
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 I think it was a sloth.

258
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 It would make sense with the toe prints.

259
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 It would make sense with the claw prints.

260
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 It would make sense that it was around that size in Arkansas.

261
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 The only thing that science would have to argue on that is that the sloth was, the giant sloth was extinct at that time.

262
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 But they've been wrong before.

263
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 And I think the answer of it being a giant sloth is far more likely than a bigfoot.

264
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 Just because the descriptions.

265
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,500
 And it's funny because as the legend grew, this is, we have this sighting.

266
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 All the other sightings were like, I saw a bigfoot.

267
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 It was a big ape and it ran like an ape and it had ape arms and stuff like that.

268
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 But this one had the claws.

269
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 So I think that this was an actual event where I think they basically found a giant sloth that attacked their house.

270
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 And then the running away thing.

271
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 I think anything that's seven feet tall that's moving away from you is going to seem like it's quite big, especially right after you've gotten tackled.

272
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 I think, don't think you're going to look up and you just see it kind of lumbering away.

273
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 You're going to be like, oh no, it ran away.

274
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 Like, I think that it would just be so scary to see.

275
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 But it maybe it did book.

276
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 Maybe it did straight up kick bricks.

277
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 Like, it maybe it was just like, I'm out of here.

278
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 Like for the first time in its life, it went from being a sloth to being Jesse Owens just to get out of there.

279
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 And he's like, oh man, that sucked.

280
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 He's running off.

281
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 The sloth was saying that, not the person.

282
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 The person Bobby Ford, I keep wanting to call him Bobby Hill.

283
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 Bobby Ford is glad that he took off.

284
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 But that's the only thing that doesn't jive with the sloth explanation.

285
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 And what's funny is that imagine if back then, instead of going the whole Bigfoot route and trying to make all these stories about Bigfoot in this area,

286
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 they went the route of, oh, we have a new cryptid down here.

287
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 It's a giant sloth that actually can exist.

288
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 Whatever the answer is though.

289
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 I talked about this before in another episode.

290
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 When human civilization starts budding up against the wilderness of the world,

291
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 I think these clashes are inevitable.

292
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 As we move deeper and deeper into cryptid territory, and there's a lot, the world is still very, very wild in a lot of places.

293
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 As we move closer and closer into these areas, the chances of us having interactions with these things go much, much higher.

294
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 I don't find Bigfoot necessarily scary because I still think the evidence of whether or not it exists is up in the air.

295
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 But the idea that an actual creature we do know exists, the giant sloth,

296
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 the fact that there could be one or more of these things still running around in the world, I think, is scarier.

297
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 What would it have done if someone was sleeping on that couch?

298
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 If those giant claws actually hit human flesh?

299
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 It's interesting because that encounter could have gone a totally different way.

300
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 Imagine there wasn't four people in this new house.

301
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 Imagine it was just one.

302
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,500
 Who got a nice little house in the middle of nowhere, young woman who wanted to just have some privacy,

303
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 and one night she falls asleep on her couch.

304
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 When she's finally noticed that she hasn't shown up for work, and her friends are getting concerned and they send people to that house,

305
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 they would have found what by all accounts would have simply been a crime scene.

306
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 Lots of blood, maybe a body, or maybe she just vanished.

307
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 You could go through all the crime scene analysis and all the questions about what could have happened,

308
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 but all the police would have found was a busted screen window that looked out into the cold Arkansas night.

309
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,500
