1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 What would you do if you fell face first into a city?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Then we traveled to South Africa to take a look at an urban legend involving a bus, a cat, and you being violently assaulted.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then we traveled to Russia to meet a man who has a close encounter of the turned kind turned into a clone today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having lots of fun in the sun doing what you're doing.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 It's almost fall. It's almost time for the spookiest month of the year, October.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And we don't know. I always say I'm gonna do a theme. I'm gonna watch spooky movies every day. I don't know.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 You guys will be lucky if I remember to do a Halloween episode. Every episode is a Halloween episode, but I never am able to schedule a special.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But you know what I am able to schedule? A warm welcome for one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Give it on up for user125. Everyone give a round of applause to user125 as they walk into Dead Rabbit Command.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 User125, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'm also thinking about setting up a, what's the thing where it's just like a one-time donation thing? Like a GoFundMe.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I really want a, what are those, a stair machine. I really want like an indoor stair machine.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Like Jason, seriously we're not gonna donate money. We're not gonna give you $1,200 to get exercise. We don't want you to live long.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 No, I really want a stair machine. It's gonna get cold soon. I don't wanna walk on the stairs, but I'm probably, I'm probably too lazy to write up the GoFundMe.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But we'll see. We'll see maybe.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 User125, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We are headed all the way out to Australia.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 User125's driving us all the way down there. We get on a ferry at some point and we take a boat most of the way.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We're gonna use one of our boat vehicles, but we didn't. We're specifically headed out to Northwest.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 That's an area in Western Australia. It's December 1984. It's nighttime.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And there's a dude working in the field. He has like the rake or like the hoe or another one of the multitude of instruments.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 That farmer, I don't know if this guy's a farmer. I just said in the notes he was working in a field. We'll call him Daniel. We don't even have a name for this guy.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But Daniel's working in the field and he's walking. He's like, "Oh, and a good day's work. I don't know what I do."

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 He has a farmer instrument and then he has, I don't know, like a Geiger counter. He's like, "I don't know what exactly my job is. I just work in a field."

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And as he's walking through the field at night, he trips. Whoa! And he lands on the ground.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What do you think? He's gonna fly away? You think this is some sort of paranormal podcast?

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 He lands on the ground and he goes, "Aw, man, what the heck?" And he looks over to see what he tripped on.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 He tripped on a fence. He was like, "Jason, that's not paranormal." Well, you didn't let me finish.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The picket fence was tiny. You're like, "Jason, that's still not paranormal. You didn't let me finish."

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 The picket fence was like, for like tiny, like, ant-sized people. Maybe not ant-sized people.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 They were like, an inch or two tall. Yeah, see? Now it's paranormal.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 There's like a fence. He realized that he tripped over...

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Save your questions. Save your questions. So, Leigh-end, okay? Because when I read this story and I typed up the notes,

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I was like, "Oh, this is fascinating." But I'm saying it out loud. Okay, just wait 'til the end. It's very short.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He says he tripped on this one-inch, two-inch tall fence and he landed in the middle of this tiny person's city.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And as he's laying on the ground, he sees little buses driving through the city and little people getting on the buses and then going to work.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He's like, "What?" And then he gets up and he realizes like he must have landed on something because he has five vertical lines on his forehead.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Similar to like a barcode. And for years after this event, he had those lines.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And everyone would be like, "Hey, Daniel, line head. That's your new name. Your children are the line heads.

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Hey, how'd you get those lines in your head?" And he goes, "You guys want to believe it. One day I was walking and I tripped on a fence."

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And they go, "That's not paranormal." And he goes, "I didn't tell you how big the fence was."

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Okay, so that's the whole story. Give me a second.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 When I read that, I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, one of my favorite websites.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 They got it from a journal or a magazine called Western Australia UFO Sightings, maybe a website.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Super specific. It's only for that region of Australia.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 When I read the story, I go, "Dude, isn't that dope? Like, imagine. Imagine if I could crush the city."

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 That's the thing when I was reading this, I go, "Wait a second. I've tripped on a lot of stuff in my life, but I haven't tripped."

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Something that's only like an inch or two tall. He doesn't actually even say how small these people are.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 They do talk about Gulliver's Travels. And they use the term "tiny." So I don't think they were like three feet tall.

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I don't think these are like little people, like dwarfs. I think it was like tiny people.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But how would you trip on a fence that's only an inch tall, and then he falls and he hits the city?

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Like, wouldn't they all be panicked? When did they just realize this giant guy fell on like half of their population,

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 but they're still getting on buses and driving around?

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 As I was reading the story out loud, I go, "Okay, what probably happened was he probably conked his head so hard."

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He hallucinated. I had a friend of mine named Ron.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 He got on a motorcycle accident once, and he fell off his bike. He didn't fall off his bike.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 He got on a horrible accident, and he flew off of his bike, and he said,

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 "And I flew all the way into a pumpkin patch." But there was no pumpkin patches.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 He goes, "I sat up, and I looked, and as far as the eye could see, I saw pumpkins."

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And then, like, people were running up to me, the great pumpkins, like, "Are you okay? Are you okay?"

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 He says, "People started, like, talking to me, and I realized I wasn't in a pumpkin patch. I was actually on the side of I-80 in Sacramento."

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So that's what I'm thinking, but then you go, "Jason, where did the five vertical lines come from?"

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And I go, "I don't think they came from a tiny picket fence, but maybe. I guess I just have some questions about this story.

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Like, how do you trip on something so small? How do they not freak out when you destroy half of their civilization?"

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 But that all being said, it is quite cute and quaint, and we don't run across a lot of those stories here on Dead Rabbit Radio.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I was like, "Oh, tiny..." Okay, he did kill half their population. They're probably still rebuilding, but I would like to see more stories

69
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 where there's just, like, tiny people going about their business. They're not abducting no one.

70
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 They're not pushing over a bus. We covered that story where there was, like, a bus in Peru.

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I'll try to find out where the show notes. It was, like, driving up a cliff, and a bunch of dwarfs came out of the mountain and pushed the bus over.

72
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Like, it's just nice to have a story where just a man stumbles and destroys a city.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But I like tiny people. I don't like fairies and stuff like that. I think that stuff's kind of lame.

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But one would be cool if every so often you could just look down and you see a bunch of little people walking around.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So that is why I included that story today. You're like, "Jason, do you have some sort of tiny person fetish?"

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 No, I do not. I know a lot of times I get accused of being a scaly for having a fetish for hot reptilian females.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That's not true either. But let's go ahead and move as I shift from side to side.

78
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 User125, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 We haven't used this vehicle in a long time. It's our battleship.

81
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 We're going to leave behind Western Australia. We are headed on out to South Africa.

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 [imitates gunshot]

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 We're headed South Africa. I came across this story recently.

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I was looking online. They had a thread about African folklore.

85
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 There's a lot of really interesting stuff, but this one really stood out to me.

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 This was the story of the Minibus legend.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 This story came from a user named Winnie Blue Sevent.

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Winnie Blue Sevent was telling the story that in the big cities in South Africa, like Johannesburg and Derba,

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 this story has gone around.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Sometimes you'll be walking around town and you're like, "You know what I really hate doing walking.

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I've been doing this a lot. I want to take the Minibus."

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I looked them up and they're like shuttles. In most parts of the world, I think it's the terminology.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It's basically like a long van. They can fit like 8 to 10 people in them.

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 It's one of the primary methods, if not the primary method of mass transportation in South Africa,

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 is the Minibus taxi. You stand on the street corner and this bus pulls up.

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 You get on it and there's other riders with you, so it's not like a taxi or an Uber or anything like that.

97
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 But the legend is like this.

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You're in the Minibus taxi and it's driving you to your destination.

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 You're not really paying attention.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 At one point you look back and you realize you're the only person on the Minibus.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 What? I swear, I just got on this Minibus to tell people where did everyone go.

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I don't even remember stopping multiple times.

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's not like you figure they got off. They're just not there.

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It is very disquieting.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 You also notice now that the Minibus doesn't seem to be driving towards your destination.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It seems to be driving down abandoned streets of Johannesburg.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 You don't really even know there were abandoned streets in Johannesburg. It's a big city.

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But you seem to be traveling down this route that you've never been down before. You didn't even know existed.

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So you get up from your seat and you begin walking through the Minibus to go talk to the driver.

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 "Hey man, where are we?" That's my first question. The second question is where did everyone else go?

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And when you get to the front of the Minibus where the driver is, there's just the cat sitting in the driver's seat.

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You go, "Okay, now I have three questions." The cat looks at you, shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 You go, "Okay, now I have three questions." The cat looks at you, shhhhhh, hisses. The next thing you know you're outside of the Minibus taxi.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You're on the side of the street in the middle of nowhere. At best, you've been robbed.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 There are stories that sometimes people wake up outside of this Minibus taxi in the middle of nowhere. They've also been raped.

116
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 This story is so interesting because it has all the trappings of a typical urban legend. It's a cautionary tale.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Cautionary tale? Be careful what Minibus tax you get and don't get into cat bus taxi because the cat's probably driving that.

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But no, pay attention to your surroundings. You start to notice stuff suspicious. Get out. If you notice the bus is taking you down.

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 You know what I mean? Like there's all of these cautionary tales that you could tell a kid, you could tell a teenager.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Being like, "Hey, if you ever decide," it's a little heavy-handed because most urban legends don't involve you getting sexually assaulted.

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But it is the moral of the story. Pay attention to your surroundings.

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 At the same time, it has this level of urban magic, which is something we don't see enough of in urban legends.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 For my liking, I really like the idea of urban magic. We've covered a couple stories about urban cryptids and stuff eating hobos.

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 We've covered stuff like that. Shapeshifting as homeless people. We've covered a lot of those types of stories.

125
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Cryptids in the big city. I'll try to find them for the show notes, but there's been so many.

126
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But not enough. So many times the cryptids are out in the middle of nowhere.

127
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Or these stories take place. These urban legends take place at lakes. You've got to watch out for the lake because there's the monster there.

128
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 You've got to watch out for Crybaby Bridge and things like this. They're always in remote locations.

129
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And I find it so fascinating when they take place in the big city. Really the place where you should feel the most safe.

130
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Now, not the most safe from street crime. Because crime rates are skyrocketing. But the most safe from monsters.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 What's interesting about this story is it doesn't involve a minibus taxi taking you between the big cities.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And then you're out in the boonies. You're out in the boondocks and something bad happens.

133
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And the moral of the story is those outsiders aren't as cool as city folk.

134
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 The story of the city is where it's taking place. So it's just a great urban legend. And then is it true?

135
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Because this is a paranormal podcast and we believe in the paranormal. It's in the realm of possibility.

136
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I'm not saying sell your stock in minibus taxis if you own stock.

137
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I'm saying that if we already believe in the idea of ghosts and realms and tiny little people that we can squish, you could easily see this being the work of a sorcerer.

138
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Instead of having a Venus flytrap, it's a bus. It's something that people need in the area.

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And you get on it, but it's actually a trap. The other passengers are just illusions.

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 You get on, you feel safety in numbers, but really you're headed towards a destination that, again, at best, you lose all your money.

141
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 So fascinating story. Most likely a folktale to remind people to be aware of their surroundings.

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 However, you can never discount the idea that darker forces may be involved.

143
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 User 125, let's go ahead and leave behind South Africa.

144
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I'm going to toss you the keys of the carbon helicopter. We are headed out to Bezhetsk, Russia.

145
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 [imitates Russian]

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 User 125 is totally shrugging his shoulders. I... dude, you have to learn how to renounce this stuff if you expect me to fly there.

147
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We're headed to the Tver region in Russia if that helps a little bit better.

148
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's April 23rd, 1997. And in the town of Bezhetsk, there's a man named Igor Yutkin.

149
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He's in his apartment, just chilling, having a good time.

150
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They don't actually say what his mental state was. He could have been really, really depressed.

151
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But we'll assume he's just sitting there. He has a nice cup of tea, enjoying the night.

152
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 All of a sudden, though, that's going to end very, very soon. A blue light penetrates his ceiling.

153
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 [imitates Russian]

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And he says it's pointing down like a stalactite.

155
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And then all of a sudden, it becomes solid. And a man and two women step out of the beam of light.

156
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So whether or not he's horribly depressed or having a great night, he's definitely in shock right now.

157
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And he's sitting there, and it takes him just a brief second to figure out the pecking order here.

158
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He immediately realizes who's in charge. It's one of the women. She's 5'5" and she's described as having...

159
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 They're human. They're humanoid, at least. She has an elongated face. Medium-sized, dark eyes.

160
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I don't... I'm reading the description in the order that I was given to me, okay?

161
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 This is exactly how you described it. And you guys will see the error. You guys will see why this is not the correct way to do this.

162
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 She's 5'5" with an elongated face, medium-sized, round, dark eyes, no hair on her head.

163
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And she's bald. She's wearing a hat like a Catholic bishop. And she's green.

164
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Which one would you... If you saw this woman, as I described her, would you start off with, "Oh, she had a nice hat."

165
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Or would you be like, "Listen, bro, I'm sitting in my apartment. I'm crippling depression."

166
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then all of a sudden some green chick showed up. By the way, all that other stuff.

167
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 She was 5'5". She had... Start off with the green. Start off with the green skin.

168
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But she is humanoid. She has that green skin. My scaly fetish... My scaly fetish senses are tingling.

169
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 She's green. She's wearing a red. She's wearing a light green dress as well.

170
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Could you imagine being walking around and wearing clothes with the same skin color?

171
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Like the exact same skin color. That seems so bizarre.

172
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But anyways, I wear khaki shorts. I'm not khaki colored, okay?

173
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But she's wearing a green dress. She has a red cloak on. She's very Christmas themed.

174
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And she's holding a scepter. That could have been the giveaway that she was the leader.

175
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But anyways, this green gal shows up and she tells Igor telepathically that her name is Zuri from the planet Galea.

176
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And she goes, "Egor, you should leave Earth with us. Come with us, because you're gonna suffer a lot through life.

177
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 But if you come with us, we're gonna get rid of those sufferings."

178
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 She actually keeps using these words, "suffer" and "sufferings".

179
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 You can decrease your sufferings if you come with us.

180
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And Igor is sitting there and he goes, "I can't. I can't go with you."

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Because if I leave, it may decrease my sufferings, but my family will suffer.

182
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Because they'll miss me. They'll never know what happened to me. I'll just vanish.

183
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Zuri goes, "We have a way around that. You see, what we can do is we can take you with us."

184
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And no one will ever notice you're gone. He's like, "Oh, I'm sure some people will notice."

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He goes, "Yes, yes. People wouldn't notice you were gone in that sense, but we actually have bio-robots.

186
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And what we can do is we can incarnate another soul into this bio-robot that looks exactly like you.

187
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 No one will be able to tell the difference. No one will miss you."

188
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And she says, "You can leave and not suffer. Come with us, Igor."

189
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And Igor looks at Zuri and says, "No. I want to stay here. I'm not leaving."

190
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Zuri and her two compatriots walk back into the beam of light and they disappear.

191
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The whole interaction took about five minutes.

192
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Igor said the very next night, April 24th, he's sitting there in his living room and, you know, for just a flash, Zuri appeared again.

193
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 He saw her for just a split second. And then she was gone forever.

194
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 That's another story actually. I usually don't plan it this way.

195
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Another story I got from ThinkAbout@Docs.com. They got it from Pavel Heilov and Anton Anfalov.

196
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 They're both UFO researchers in Eastern Europe. We've covered other stuff that they've talked about before.

197
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 This is one of the stories I've had on the docket for a long time. I've wanted to share with you guys because the implications are really, really unsettling.

198
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The first thing is, is there ability to... There's a couple different things going on.

199
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Like there's one, they come down to ease Igor's sufferings. That term is used a lot in this.

200
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 You have to wonder why Igor? Two, how do they know Igor's going to suffer in the future?

201
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Like they're trying to alleviate obstacles he's going to face in the future.

202
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So how do they know what's going to happen in the future?

203
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But then we go... They can clone people.

204
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I mean, you assume aliens have alien technology that they can teleport. They can travel the speed of light.

205
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 They can beam through apartment ceilings. So why wouldn't they be able to clone?

206
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It would make sense they'd be able to clone. But perfect duplicates of people, sure, that's sci-fi level technology.

207
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But this is a duplicate that is you.

208
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 So you go with them and your clone is left behind and no one knows.

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 How do we know the true number of people who have traveled away with aliens?

210
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 The person's only missing when they're missing, when you can't find them.

211
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 If one of your loved ones, one night is visited by this people and goes, "You're right, I don't want to suffer."

212
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 "You got a biorobot that looks just like me, leave him here and no one will know."

213
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 "Yeah, I'm out."

214
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And then you go visit your dad or your uncle or your mom or your niece or whatever and it's not them.

215
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I mean, it is, for all intents and purposes, if you did any sort of DNA test on them, it's them.

216
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But it's not them. Or not really them.

217
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I mean, okay, don't go chasing your niece with a hammer now.

218
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And you're like, "I'm gonna find out what's really behind the alien agenda."

219
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 But what if it happens four more often than we think?

220
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And they're just getting replaced with these biorobots.

221
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I mean, you could have mass abductions every single day.

222
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We wouldn't know because the people aren't missing.

223
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Secondly, she showed back up and then she disappeared in a flash.

224
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So when I read that, I had something pop in my head and when I told you that, you might have had the same suspicion.

225
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Igor is a clone now. Igor now is a clone.

226
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 When she came back, Igor Prime, the real Igor, agreed to go with her.

227
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 The bio clone was left behind, thinking he was the real Igor.

228
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Seeing her disappear in a flash was the ending of that conversation between Igor Prime and Zuri.

229
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And the clone has a brief memory of it and that's it.

230
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And the clone goes, "Well, I guess she popped back in. I don't know why she was here."

231
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I mean, even though she was here yesterday to clone me and to take me away,

232
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 this time she just showed up and did neither of those things.

233
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So everything's okay, but he's the clone.

234
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 The perfect clone wouldn't know they were a clone.

235
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 The real Igor, Igor Prime, is not suffering.

236
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He's in the stars with Zuri.

237
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 The perfect clone wouldn't know it's a clone.

238
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 This could be happening all the time and we wouldn't know because we don't know what people are missing.

239
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 We don't know to investigate it.

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 What happens when the world is more clone than human?

241
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 What if it's not even a what if?

242
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Let's say that's the case.

243
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And 30%-- imagine that.

244
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Imagine if 30% of the humans on planet are conspiracy caps fully on.

245
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Again, I don't want you to walk around with the crossbow going, "Jason told me everyone's a clone."

246
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Conspiracy caps fully on.

247
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 This has been going on, let's say, most generous estimates.

248
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 This has been going on since the 1950s.

249
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Betty and Barney Hill, first alien encounter with a human, I think was like '50s, late '50s, early '60s.

250
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Forget ancient aliens. I'm just being conservative here.

251
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Betty and Barney Hill, till now, that's still about a 50-60 year window of aliens abducting people.

252
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I mean, how many clones would be out there? What if it is down to 30% original humans?

253
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Or less.

254
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Because we wouldn't know we were the clone. Statistically at this point, again, conspiracy caps fully on.

255
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 What if I'm the clone?

256
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 What if you're the clone and we're going about our clone lives?

257
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The real us are partying on some planet, not suffering.

258
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But the clones are left here to continue to suffer.

259
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 This is where insanity begins, having this belief that you're the only real person.

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's actually a really key part of insane behavior.

261
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 But conspiracy caps fully on will indulge and will wrap the episode up like this.

262
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 The next time you're looking in the mirror, look a little closer.

263
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 See if there's an imperfection that you didn't notice before.

264
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 See if there's a clue that you're not the same person you were just yesterday.

265
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But maybe their technology is perfect and you can't spot a flaw.

266
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Once again reassuring you that you are the real you.

267
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 But what would be better?

268
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 To know for sure that you were a clone.

269
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And another version of yourself was celebrating life in a world of no suffering.

270
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Or never knowing the truth.

271
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Not knowing why you are experiencing all the sufferings you are.

272
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 But you are put through these trials and tribulations.

273
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So the real you can travel the stars.
