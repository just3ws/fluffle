1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 We return to a mysterious canyon for an unusual update.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 A man and his father fight in a living room with horrible yet hilarious consequence.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then finally we take a look at a woman who believed that vampires were taking over the world.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And the only way to stop them was to kill them one by one by one.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Episode 2 of Vampire Week. Episode 2 of recording all 5 episodes in one day.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Still got good energy. We're still ready to go.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 First off I want to say thank you to my latest Patreon.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 This is the last Patreon we'll probably get to this week.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Gary Foster. Thanks for supporting the show.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Gary Foster sent us the Vampire Pope story which I covered a couple weeks back.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 He sent me some other stuff that will be covered in the future.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 But thank you Gary very much for supporting the show.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I also let's take a trip back to Gattington Canyon.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Let's hop on board the Carbner Coptor. Let's go flying over the canyon.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Now Gattington Canyon was something I covered probably about 4 or 5 episodes ago.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It's a canyon in Utah.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Well even that's an interesting question.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 There is a canyon in Utah. Whether or not it's known as Gattington Canyon.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Even that's up for debate. It's a very very bizarre story.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 The story we covered were these 4 girls tried to get home to their dorms.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 They took a shortcut through the canyon. They met a dead end in the canyon that they didn't know was there.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 They turn around and go back. They end up in an alternate dimension where a bunch of yokel aliens chase them back to our world.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 They chase them back to our reality.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Now one of the websites I cited on that show was the debunker files.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That's where I said this guy said that Gattington Canyon there's no such place.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 There's no canyon named that. And I verified that.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And that's true. There is no canyon named Gattington Canyon.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And the guy who does the debunker files listens to the podcast.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And he goes, "Yeah, I guess I might have said that his website was stupid.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I don't remember saying that. I remember just kind of being like, his website's kind of, uh, but he did have this piece of information.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He listens to the podcast and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you know, I came up with that website when I was like 15 and stuff like that."

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And he went back and read the website he had written. He goes, "I totally forgot that I had even written that.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Heard it on your show and I was like, "What?" And then he read that and he was laughing about it.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I said, I didn't think it was poorly written, but that was the only source that said Gattington Canyon wasn't a real place.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now, I was able to verify that, but it was interesting. All these stories about Gattington Canyon.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So I want to thank Sean for coming up with that piece of information. That was kind of the linchpin for that story.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But that's not the main reason I'm doing this update. I got an email from somebody named Temporal.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I think that's the name. It's a lot of letters and numbers, but Temporal, I got this email.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And he found, because I think I said the earliest reference of Gattington Canyon I found was like 2007 or something like that.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 He was able to find it earlier from 2000. So this is an old story. This is much older than I thought it was.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And what's super interesting is he stumbled across this as well. So thank you, Temporal, for finding this out.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 There's another wrinkle in this bizarre story, because I was kind of like, "Eh, this is weird."

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 In 1945, there was a book called Utah, A Guide to the State.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, the Gattington Canyon story supposedly took place in the 1970s.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 In Utah, people refer to that area as like the Gattington area, or the Gattington Canyon,

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 because in the Book of Mormon, there was a Gattington gang operating out of a canyon in that area.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And I explained that in the first episode as well, but this is an interesting note in this book written in 1945.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 They're talking about the area with the canyons that the Gattingtons used to work at.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Here's the quote, "Wide-eyed freighters told tales of rocks closing the way, and of the canyon folding up to entrap them."

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And that was similar to when they were driving through the canyon and they came across that new wall.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They came to a dead end when they thought that it just kept going on and on.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So the story of A Canyon in that area having unique characteristics in and of itself,

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 of changing the landscape, go back to 1945. Absolutely bizarre.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 There really may be more to that story. They may be the ones who got away.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Thank you, Tim Porrell and Sean. Thank you for doing that work on that.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 We're in the Carbenter Coptor flying around. Let's leave Utah and head out to MacLeod, Oklahoma.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Flying overhead, throwing bread at seagulls.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 When I was a kid, there was that thing where my brother's friends were taking Alka-seltzers,

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 wrapping them in bread and throwing them and the seagulls would eat the Alka-seltzer, and then they'd blow up.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Now, I don't think that's true. I think that the mechanism is true.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I think that because they can't pass gas or something like that and the Alka-seltzer makes them super gassy,

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 that their stomach might just tend, but I don't think they blew up midair.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But anyways, we're not doing that. We're throwing bread.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 We're making up for those horrible kids at Mount Telmopai is High who were doing that.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 We're throwing bread out of the... You're like, Jason, you just fly this stupid thing.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You can throw bread out of the helicopter. I'm flying around.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You're just eating the bread yourself every time we turn around.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Like, are the birds following us? And you're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 "Eight grain. Eight grain toast."

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Like what? Where'd you get a toaster?

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So anyways, we're flying the helicopter around.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I smell the delicious smell of butter on toast.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I'm like, I'm on keto flying around and we get...

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 We're going to land in the sky's front yard, right?

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And we're landing there right when the cops are showing up.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 We're like, "Oh, it's getting good. We didn't deal with any of that boring preamble."

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Cops are showing up to the house. We go in after them.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 We just walk in after the cops. We're invisible.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Or we have badges, dude.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 We have like... I should have come up with these 200 episodes ago.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 We have like a police badge that when we flash it, it's whatever...

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Okay, now it's getting too convoluted. It's whatever jurisdiction it needs to be.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So if I show it to a librarian, it's a library card.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 If I show it to a cop, it's an outranking officer.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So anyways, that's a new gimmick that I'll probably totally forget about right away.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 We show our brand new Dead Rabbit ID badge. What's a good name for that?

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Lupine license. Lupine's a rabbit, right? Lupus license.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Lupus license. I'm never going to mention it again.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 We show our Lupus license and they're like, "Oh, gentlemen and/or lady."

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Because you know, you never know. Go on in.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I have a varied audience. Walk on in. So we walk in the crime scene, step in over all the stuff.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 You're dropping bread in the crime scene.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Anyways, we're at the crime scene.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And what we see is there's a young man there. He's about 34.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 His name is Brad Lee Davis. Just a couple letters short of being Bruce Lee Davis, which would have been dope.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Brad Lee Davis is sitting there in the house.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He's like, "Can I have some bread?" We're like, "No, no. We want to know the whole story and then maybe give you some bread."

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And he's like, "That's fair."

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Now he's fine, but there's a body lane in the house as well.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And it's this older guy. His name, tell me if this, I read this name and I was like, "Is this like...

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 This name, my... This name just sounds like a cologne.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Denver St. Clair." This dude's name.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He's an older man. He's dead. His underwear.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 [laughs]

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He's dead. He's laying on the ground with an atomic wedgie.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So his underwear is pulled... This is 100% true.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 His underwear is pulled all the way up his back, over his head, over his face.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 The elastic band is around his neck. He's just laying on the ground dead.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And you're like, "What went on here? Mr. Brad, what's going on here?"

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And he goes, "Well, me and my... This is my stepdad."

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 He points over the guy with the atomic wedgie. Cops are taking pictures.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 "This is my stepdad." And he's been abusive towards my mom.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And we're like, "Ah, it's not very funny. Why'd she have to tell us that?"

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, I know. It's not very funny. It kind of looks at us."

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You guys are doing a comedy podcast where you cover in the story.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 We're like, "Well, you know, look at the wedgie."

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 He's like, "Okay, anyways."

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So this guy was abusive towards my mom and we got in a fight.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And I was afraid for my life.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So look at all this stuff that's been knocked over during this huge, long fight.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So I finally hit him so hard and knocked him out.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And then, just, you know, because I thought it was funny, I gave him an atomic wedgie.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I took the underwear and put it all the way over his body, over his head, and wrapped it around his neck.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Now the problem is, there's actually several problems with that.

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 The atomic wedgie is what killed him.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The elastic band... Tell me this is going to be a good advertising.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Someone made the joke about it. I think it was Carson made this joke.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I mean, the underwear holds up so well, not only was he able to get the elastic band from a guy's butt crack over his head,

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and wrapped around his neck, but it crushed... like, suffocated him.

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 They don't name the brand of the underwear, but that's quite impressive, honestly.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Death by atomic wedgie.

137
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Now, the police are doing their investigation. They start to notice some things.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They don't necessarily dispute the fact that the son felt he was being abusive towards the mother,

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 but I couldn't see anything, any statements from the mother saying that was true.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 The police don't believe there was an all-out fight.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 They believe he attacked his stepfather, knocked him unconscious, gave him the wedgie,

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and then trashed the place himself to make it look like it was a big fight.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So now things are getting really weird.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And the cops said, "Yeah, he did die of an atomic wedgie."

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But his head injury that knocked him unconscious was so bad, that would have killed him if he hadn't gotten treatment.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Anyways.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So, Bradley Davis gets dragged into court, sat down.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He pled guilty to manslaughter 30 years in prison for killing your stepfather with an atomic wedgie.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I'm not saying that's not necessarily an unjust sentence.

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I'm saying, "Oh, man, like, he's 34 years old. He's gonna be in prison until he's 64. You guys know how to do math."

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 But, I mean, just think about that. Just for doing an atomic wedgie, one of the statements he said at the judge was,

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 "I feel like this is a terrible nightmare." And you're like, "Jason, again, this is a comedy podcast. Why are you dwelling on this?"

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 One, atomic wedgie, that's pretty funny.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But I don't know, man, it's just, it's a funny story, but it's also like quite miserable.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 This guy threw his life away, punched the dude, and, okay, it's depressing.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 The atomic wedgie part's funny, but the end's depressing.

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Now, I will tell you this. Let's go ahead and segue on to our next story.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 This next story is depressing, too.

159
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It involves vampires, kind of.

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Well, technically, it involves vampires, but it's kind of depressing.

161
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 So, it's kind of funny, though, too.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So, again, it's kind of in the-- I probably should have put these stories in different episodes.

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 This one's also kind of depressing, so-- but again, you know.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with it. If you just want to jump to tomorrow's episode, what's tomorrow's episode about?

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Let me give you a quick preview if you don't want to hang around for this one.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 What's tomorrow? Wednesday? Well, I'm recording it a half hour from now, but--

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Oh, yeah, tomorrow's episode.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It's vampire, of course. We're doing vampire week.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And it's about a vampire that started, at all.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Not Dracula, that's lame. Not Volod the Impaler.

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Anyways, just listen to tomorrow's episode.

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Let's go ahead and get on to this next story.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So, we are going to go ahead, hop in the Carpenter Copter one last time for this episode.

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 We're saying goodbye to Bradley Davis.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 We walk out of the courtroom, and we're like, "That was an unfortunate--"

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 You're like, "Jason, that was not funny."

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 That story wasn't as funny as you thought it was, and I was like, "Yeah, the headline seemed funny."

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 We started talking about it, and once I mentioned the domestic violence angle, I realized that it wasn't as funny as I remembered.

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So, we stop by the bread store. You're like, "I need my bread."

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "I'll get you some more bread to make up for that depressing story."

181
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 You're like, "This next story is going to be fun, right?"

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah, totally fun. Here, eat some bagels."

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So, let's hop in the Carpenter Copter. We're flying to Notting Hill, birthplace of Hugh Grant.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And we are going to the year 2015.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Now, this story was a suggestion from Mason Norbeck, the architect of Vampire Week.

186
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And we're going-- so, thanks, Mason. We're going to Notting Hill.

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And we meet a woman. Her name is Shelley Christopher.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 "Hey, that is weird. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. Christopher Lee played Dracula, and Frankenstein fought Dracula."

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So, that's weird that her name is this, and it's a vampire story.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And yes, the heat is starting to affect my brain.

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Shelley Christopher, 36 years old. I don't know if Christopher Lee played Dracula.

192
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 He was in Swarm, but I'm sure he did, eventually.

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I do not know Christopher Lee's. I know he was a Sith.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 He was Count Dooku, and he was Salomon. That's all I know.

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 If he was Dracula, that was a total fluke.

196
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Okay, so Shelley Christopher, 36 years old. She's walking into a mental health clinic.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And she walks up to the front counter, and she's like, rings a little bell.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Ding, ding, ding. There's some nurse who comes out with a padded jacket.

199
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And she's like, "Can I help you?" And she goes, "Yes. Yes, I've-- I've got to start making the jokes early, because this one gets depressing."

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 She's like, "Yes, I'll have a number seven." And they have like a list of paranoid delusions on a menu.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 She's like, "I'll have a number seven." So, number seven was, "Vampires are out to get you."

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 She's being followed, right?

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And as she's at the mental health clinic waiting to get checked in, waiting for her order, they put it up on a little spindle, and there's like a psychiatrist behind the counter.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 He's like, "Number seven, coming up."

205
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 As she's waiting to get checked in, she starts to notice there are vampires in the clinic.

206
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 They're like doing taxes. One of them is at the water fountain, the blood's shooting out of it.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So, she leaves. Now, from that little intro, you should be able to tell this woman is full-on delusional.

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Delusional at this point. So, whatever her life circumstance-- we're-- we don't know much about her.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 This is a totally true story. It went through the court system. We don't know much about how she got to this point.

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But, February 2015, she walks into a clinic, sees vampires leave. So, full-on delusion at this point.

211
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, the fact that she went to the health clinic in the first place makes you think-- the mental health clinic makes you think she knew something was wrong.

212
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But, nonetheless, she sees her most hated enemies there, the vampire, she leaves.

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 She goes home, and she's sitting in her living room. And she's like, "I can't go there, because there's vampires there, she has a checklist all the places."

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 It's like graveyards, no. Unsanctified churches, no. She's like crossing all this stuff out.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And she's like, "I don't know where to go now." And then she hears a voice go,

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 "You know what you need to do, Shelly. You know what you need to do."

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Shelly's like, "Where's that voice coming from?" And she looks up.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 There's a light bulb in the kitchen light. And it goes, "Yes, Shelly. It is I, a light bulb."

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 "You know what you need to do. You need to kill the vampires."

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "They're taking over the world, Shelly. And only you can stop them."

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Now, as a comedy podcast, someone would make a joke about whether or not it was an animated light bulb with like lips and eyes.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Did it look like Clippy from the Microsoft Word document? Or was she just staring at-

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 What? In reality, she was just looking at a light bulb. But again, I've talked about this before. What does a delusional person see?

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Was the light bulb, was it just like going, "Shelly, it was like lighting on and off?" Or was it like, "Have a mouth."

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Did it look like a light bulb that would appear over Roger Rabbit's head? I don't know.

226
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 But anyways, a light bulb tells her that vampires are taking over the planet and she has to stop them, right?

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And she's sitting there and she's like, "Ugh, I don't know. I've got a lot of stuff to do."

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Light bulb's like, "The world is in trouble, Shelly. You have to kill the vampires."

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And Shelly Christopher's sitting there and she goes, "Hm, speaking of vampires, there is a little girl living with me right now."

230
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So later on, her boyfriend, Richard Brown, shows up at her house.

231
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Now, again, I'm assuming Richard had to know that things were deteriorating with Shelly. Something was totally going wrong.

232
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Richard Brown shows up at the house and he brings along their daughter, Sophia.

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And we don't know a lot of details because the only witness to this is certifiably insane.

234
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Richard Brown gets to the house and asks Shirley, "What's going on, dude?"

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So he had to have assumed that he maybe was trying to get a hold of her or something like that.

236
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But he goes to the house and asks her what's going on. That's the exact quote.

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And Shirley's looking right at him and she just goes, "You're one of them. You're a vampire."

238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And she sticks him right in the chest. She begins stabbing him and then she says, "He becomes a vampire."

239
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 As she's stabbing him, she says his eyes turned color and he began to try to bite her.

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And so that only fuels her delusion even more because as she's murdering this man, she's watching him change into a monster.

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So she finishes him off and then she turns to her daughter and says, "Are you one of them?"

242
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And Sophia says, "Yes, I am, mummy."

243
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Shirley picks the knife back up.

244
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 The light bulb then tells Shirley.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 The light bulb is just watching this whole thing being like, "Oh, this joke went on too long.

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 She's getting punked by Ashton Kutcher."

247
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He put a microphone in the light bulb. He's like, "Dude, this will be so funny.

248
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Watch Mariah and Carrie murder these people." And then they're like, "Oh my god."

249
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So anyways, she's not getting punked. She's in a full mental breakdown at this point.

250
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 The light bulb says, "You've stabbed them, but remember they're vampires. You must stake them with wood."

251
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So Shirley Christopher gets the only wood, really, that a suburban house mom would have.

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Pinsels and a child's paintbrush.

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And was stabbing them now with pencils and a wooden child's toothbrush.

254
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Now, a miracle happens.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 The first girl, so she was at the house when the light bulb started talking to her.

256
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 She realized she had a little girl in the house.

257
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 She lives.

258
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Totally, she got really, really stabbed up.

259
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And that happened before her boyfriend and her daughter came over.

260
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So she attacked this one girl.

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Then she, then later, boyfriend, daughter shows up, kills them.

262
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But then the other girl's still alive.

263
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 So again, because Shelly is nuts, she, well, this is a good nuts.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 She takes the first victim to the hospital and says, "Oh, look at what, she must have fallen down the stairs."

265
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And they're like, "Her face has severely slashed up."

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Like, she was really, really cut up, but she survived.

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And so the hospital staff, Shelly's sitting in the waiting room, and the hospital staff's like,

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 "Uh, we better get the cops down here."

269
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So the cops went and talked to her, they went to the house, they walked in, they found the bodies.

270
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Bodies of the boyfriend and the daughter.

271
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 What happens is, almost immediately, everyone is just like this woman's too insane to stand trial.

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They did go through the whole, like the prosecutors wanted her blood,

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 but prosecutors go through the rigmarole, defense lawyers is like, "She's insane."

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 There were allegations that she was faking the insanity, which is always possible,

275
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 but she was eventually found insane, and sentenced to nothing.

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 She was basically just put in a mental hospital against her will.

277
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Too insane to even stand trial.

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 If you can't understand the charges against you, you're too insane to be tried for anything.

279
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And I'm sure with the right course of medicine, all of these illusions go away.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I remember once, when I lived in Sacramento, it was probably back in 2001,

281
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I was driving home from this chicks house, and it was probably like 2 in the morning, something like that.

282
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 There's driving along Antelope Road out in the middle of nowhere.

283
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It's out actually where I covered the story with like, it used to be a Japanese internment camp.

284
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 It's out over there.

285
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 It wasn't that wasn't there when I was there.

286
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It was like, "Hey guys, just driving by."

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I'm like, "Look at me, I'm free."

288
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 That happened years, decades before me.

289
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 But anyways, I was enjoying riding around miserable people.

290
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 So I'm driving through basically Antelope towards Citrus Heights.

291
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And I saw off in the distance, it would have been a couple miles away.

292
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 So I mean, it wasn't like right around the corner, but probably about three or four miles away.

293
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Sacramento's fairly flat.

294
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I saw this massive, you guys are going to be chasing this, this might be your dumbest story ever,

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 but I'm driving, it's late at night, I'm all alone on the road.

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I see a massive blue beam shooting up into the sky.

297
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And I go, "That's weird."

298
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And now it was, the circumference was, it had to be, God, I don't know.

299
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I mean, the fact that I could see it as far away as it was,

300
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 it would have had to be maybe about like 100 yards in circumference.

301
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And it was a couple miles away, and it was shooting up as one giant beam.

302
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 It looked like a giant spotlight, but again, there's no spotlights that are 100 yards across that I know of.

303
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And it was blue.

304
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And I remember driving by and I was looking at it and I thought,

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 "I bet you right now, over there, there's some epic battle between good and evil going on,

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 and like some Skeletor's trying to open a portal, and Gallador for whatever is there,

307
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 like trying to work on this little device real quick,

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 because the good guys are like fighting off this horrible entity attacking Earth."

309
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And I thought, "I should drive over there and be part of that adventure.

310
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I should just stop by and see what's going on."

311
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Now, I didn't, because obviously I'm still, I'm here and not in Eternia.

312
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But I remember I was looking over at that beam, and I thought,

313
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I was kind of compelled to go over there and find out what it was,

314
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 at the very least to find out what it was,

315
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 had the most maybe join a group of heroes traveling across the dimensions fighting Skeletor.

316
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But I said, "Nah, I'm too tired."

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to do tomorrow."

318
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So I drove past this portal that was opening up and went to bed.

319
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 The reason why I tell that story, totally true story, absolutely happened.

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Now, again, logically it was probably some something else, something not that.

321
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 But the reason why I tell that story is because I think it's really easy to look at things

322
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 that are paranormal, that are weird, and to kind of get swept up in the moment of it.

323
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Think about it this way.

324
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I think an insane person who had a delusion would go to every giant light they saw in the sky

325
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 expecting to see Skeletor showing up.

326
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Like, does that make sense?

327
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And I think a rational person will drive by something like that and go,

328
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 "A rational person would go, 'Oh, there's just probably nothing.'

329
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 A person who's interested in this stuff like us would go to check it out."

330
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And then a delusional person would have websites about blue beams being spotted all over the world

331
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and tracking them on huge maps and stuff like that.

332
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 The reason why I'm sharing that story with you and kind of relating it back to this is

333
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 we deal in this stuff all the time.

334
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 We're fans of the paranormal.

335
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 She obviously, we know that they weren't vampires.

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 They were murder victims.

337
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 The reason why we know that is because if they were real vampires,

338
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 it takes more than a pencil and a paintbrush to put one down,

339
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 and the other girl survives, so she obviously wasn't a vampire.

340
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You know, just there's a lot of like stuff going on.

341
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 This woman was mentally ill.

342
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Light bulbs are talking to her.

343
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And so this is what I'm getting at.

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 This is what I'm getting at.

345
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Let's say that you, you personally, stumble across the conspiracy.

346
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Let's say that you discovered that there's something weird happening in your neighborhood.

347
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 That's not on the up and up.

348
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And then one night you do decide,

349
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 "Hey, you know, I just want to drive in that area a little bit later

350
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 and see if I can see what's up."

351
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 At the very least, it'll be an interesting story to tell my buddies.

352
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I thought this guy was selling drugs out of his car, and it turns out he was just unloading his grandma's laundry late at night or something like that.

353
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And you come, you, being a rational human being, being an intelligent person,

354
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 you see a vampire.

355
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And not just a fleeting glimpse of a dark shadow walking by a building or a man wearing a cape.

356
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 You see a man drink the blood of a victim just right in front of you.

357
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 First off, would you tell anybody?

358
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You may tell people online.

359
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And I think you'd probably have a hard time believing that that's actually what you saw.

360
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But then you continue to go back or continue to look into it.

361
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And you come to the belief that vampires are taking over part of your city.

362
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 What do you do?

363
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Because it's the same thing.

364
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Let's say that you felt that the Crips, the street gang, the Crips were moving drugs through your neighborhood.

365
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Some of you are like, "They are. I know they are. I'm one of the Crips."

366
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But let's say that in your area where that activity is not necessarily normal,

367
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 you come to the idea that there is a gang moving drugs through your city.

368
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Or intimidating shop owners, kicking over Apple Cards, whatever.

369
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 You could go to the police.

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 If you see someone get assaulted and beat up, you could go to the police.

371
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But if you don't have that option, if you're watching people drink the blood of other people

372
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 and like burn in the - let's say there's no evidence, they're burning the bodies or whatever.

373
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It's all hypothetical.

374
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 What do you do?

375
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 You believe and you have evidence.

376
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 You've seen it. You can't prove it to anyone else.

377
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But you have seen with your own eyes vampires attacking people in your city.

378
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And they're going to try to take over city council for whatever nefarious scheme they have next.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 What do you do?

380
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 That's the interesting question about the story.

381
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 This woman was insane, but she thought she wasn't.

382
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Even though she went and went to the health clinic, she probably had a little bit of doubts like we would.

383
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 After the first vampire attack, you'd be like, "Oh my God, I'm going nuts."

384
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But after the fourth one, you would be drawing maps, marking out vampire attacks.

385
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 What do you do? That's such an interesting question.

386
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Because if you truly believe that your city, the world, is on the cusp of takeover of vampires,

387
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 and nobody else knows what do you do.

388
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 If you do anything, you will be labeled a murderer and a psychopath.

389
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And it's probably true.

390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 You probably didn't really uncover a vampire ring trying to take over city council.

391
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But you never know.

392
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 You never know.
