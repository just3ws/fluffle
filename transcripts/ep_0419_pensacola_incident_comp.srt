1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Takashi69 is out of jail due to the coronavirus.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,440
 A conspiracy theorist takes one for the team trying to expose the truth.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
 Trying to wake up the sheeple.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,360
 And then we travel to Pensacola, Florida to meet a man with a bizarre tale.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,240
 Is it true that one night, him and his friends went deep sea diving?

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,200
 And instead, a creature came from the depths to kill them one by one.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:41,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,400
 I'm your host Jason Kirfner.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
 So we're gonna kind of get started here.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,320
 First off, tomorrow night, Friday night at 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,240
 We're gonna do the movie club.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,600
 I've been talking about this all week.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,120
 I'm currently doing that shutter.com special.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,880

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
 I'm not sponsored by them.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
 I just really like the service.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,120
 The movies that I watched this week that we're gonna discuss tomorrow are

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,520
 The Room, the horror movie version.

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
 They shouldn't have named it that.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,880
 The Room, the horror movie version.

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,160
 One Cut of the Dead.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,840
 Soul Station.

28
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
 It's an anime.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
 Most of these are foreign actually.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,960
 Mandy, the Nicholas Cage movie Mandy.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,160
 And then Train to Busan.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,600
 I rewatched it again today.

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,120
 So there's gonna be the five movies we're gonna discuss tomorrow on YouTube,

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,320
 live streaming.

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
 Check out my YouTube channel.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,880
 If you haven't seen those movies, I'm gonna go completely into spoilers on that live stream.

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
 And I'm gonna upload the live stream to the podcast as well.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
 I'll probably upload that Sunday.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,080
 So I'll be discussing spoilers.

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,560
 And all of these movies are super spoilery.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,480
 Like all of them, you really don't want to know anything about them.

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,920
 Until you watch them.

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,120
 So I recommend watching those.

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
 All those movies are available on Shutter.

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,080
 They're also available.

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,360
 You can rent them.

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,120
 Check them out on other venues as well.

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
 You don't have to use Shutter.

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,560
 It's just free right now if you use that promo code.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
 And again, I'm not sponsored by them.

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
 So check out those movies.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
 Tomorrow night at 7 p.m.

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
 Come to talk with me about them on live stream.

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,200
 And again, all of them, all of them have some amazing twists and turns in them.

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,880
 So join me tomorrow night for our thing.

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,520
 I said I wanted to do more live streaming during this whole shutdown thing.

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
 But then I was like, I'm not a huge fan of live streaming unless there's some sort of structure.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
 When it's just me live streaming and being like,

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
 so what do you guys want to talk about?

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
 It's like an awkward date me and 50 people.

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,960
 And I think things go better when we have some sort of structure.

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
 So we'll do that.

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,480
 Like the live stream Thanksgiving episodes, one of my favorite episodes.

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
 I actually never listened back to it, but my memories of it were really fun.

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,720
 And then the Halloween one was pretty cool too, where I was showing you around my town.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,320
 But anyway, so yeah, we'll see how this movie thing goes.

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,520
 Let's go ahead and get started.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,240
 We got a ton of stuff to talk about today.

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,520
 First off, and this is just breaking news.

70
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,680
 I just found this as I was getting ready to record.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
 I just read this about five minutes ago.

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,160
 Takashi69 is out of jail.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,240
 Now Takashi69, if you don't know him, is an idiot.

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,880
 Right?

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,280
 Now I don't talk trash about a lot of people on this show unless they're like some sort of

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,240
 weird cult leader or some sort of like just disgusting serial killer or whatever.

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
 Takashi69 is an idiot.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,240
 He's an idiot.

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,560
 He was originally came on my radar.

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
 You know, I'm a big rap fan, but I'm not a fan of like this newer type of rap.

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 He's more of like a SoundCloud rapper.

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
 That's kind of where he made his bones.

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,880
 And now he's huge.

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
 He's doing something with Nicki Minaj.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,720
 Stuff like that.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,640
 But he came into my vision because I'm reading the newspaper and he gets charged with like

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,960
 production of child pornography.

88
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
 This rapper.

89
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,080
 Now when I was a kid back in my day, the gangster rappers I listened to, maybe they'd catch

90
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
 like a murder charge and get off like Snoop Dogg did.

91
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,520
 Maybe they might have some connection.

92
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
 You know, maybe there's like two levels down.

93
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,840
 Someone's dealing coke out of like the record management's office.

94
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
 But this dude, I don't know what it is with kids these days.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,880
 This guy gets busted for being part of this.

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,160
 This dude was banging a 13 year old and he was like in the background being like,

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,720
 "Yo, what's up?

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
 What's up, dude?

99
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,880
 Throwing up a gangsta.

100
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
 Come on guys."

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
 Anyways, he walks because he's rich.

102
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
 Anyways, like that's an ass whooping.

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,360
 Right.

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,840
 If you ever had a party and some dudes making a movie on a 13 year old,

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,960
 in my back in my day, that was an ass whooping.

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
 Anyways, he walks on that.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,600
 And then he gets swept up in this giant Rico charge thing about a year or two ago.

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
 For, he gets caught up with this, I mean, come on dude.

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
 All gangs really are just kind of scary in general.

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,720
 There was a gang called the Smurfs.

111
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
 I profiled them.

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,440
 They're not too scary, but Nine Trey Gangster Bloods.

113
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,760
 He's running with these guys and he liked it because it gave him some street cred, right?

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
 Because he's this young dude.

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
 He's like 23 years old.

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,040
 He's this young dude.

117
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,920
 What up, but a boob, but a but a boob, but that's pretty much every song he's ever recorded.

118
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,280
 And then he has like 10 giant black dudes in the back of every video.

119
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
 They're all blood.

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,840
 So it gave him some credibility when he was coming up in the game.

121
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
 They used him because he was popular.

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
 He had a lot of money and whenever they wanted to move stuff, he had private jets and everything like that.

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,640
 So it was a plus plus, a symbiotic relationship between the two.

124
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,200
 Well, then the FBI wrapped them all up.

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,440
 They arrested this kid, his 23 year old wannabe thug, and then a bunch of real thugs.

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
 And what happened was exactly what the FBI thought was going to happen.

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
 He turned really, really quickly on him.

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,000
 Now, me personally, in my personal view on quote unquote snitching, if you witness a crime

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
 and you're not involved in that crime and you have no, if you see like a shooting or a mugging

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
 or something like that, I think you can step forward and say, hey, that guy did that.

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,280
 I would say use better judgment if you see a bunch of gangsters doing it

132
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,560
 and you know that your life or the lives of your loved ones will be in jeopardy kind of way that.

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 And I know people may not agree with that, but that's just from my own personal

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
 experience.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,200
 If you see like organized crime activity and it's not too serious, you just may be,

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,640
 I got that and that's what I've done in the past.

137
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,360
 But anyways, the point is, if you see just one dude mugging someone, you have tournament.

138
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,160
 I don't consider that snitching, but if I'm working in a criminal enterprise and we all get caught

139
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,840
 and then to lessen my penalty, that snitching, that's being a snitch.

140
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,760
 To me, there's one thing between being a concerned citizen and being like, hey,

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
 I don't think that's right.

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
 What's going on and calling authorities to me.

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,800
 That's not snitching.

144
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,600
 I know some people think that is, but I don't think it is.

145
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,920
 But if I'm caught and you're caught and it's that prisoner's dilemma thing and I want to get out,

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
 that's straight up snitching, dude.

147
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:15,120
 So not only was Takashi six nine, okay, being in a child porn video is way, way worse than

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
 being a snitch.

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
 But the first one's probably not going to get him killed.

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
 Second one might because he ended up getting these other two guys really long prison sentences.

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,040
 Corona six nine Takashi six nine has been in a private prison basically since because the

152
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,640
 danger so real to him and he has a really bad asthma.

153
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,200
 So he finally was he was freaking out this whole time and he goes, please, please, please let me out.

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,200
 I got to get back on the streets where I'm safe and the judge is probably like, uh,

155
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,560
 yeah, yeah, Takashi six nine.

156
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
 Yeah, it's real safe out there, but they did.

157
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
 They just let him go.

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,080
 So technically he's under house arrest or he's going somewhere they didn't reveal where.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,800
 But when this is all over, he's supposed to report back to jail, but he only has

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,400
 he only got like a four year sentence and I guess he's like halfway through that or something like that.

161
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,640
 So anyways, if I get it, listen, dude, I have friends in prison.

162
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,520
 I have a really close friend in prison right now and I feel really bad for him because,

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
 you know, he doesn't have that opportunity.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,920
 You know, they're running out of soap and stuff like that.

165
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,280
 You know, I'm blessed where I'm at where, you know, I could wash my hands.

166
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,040
 I have ample food supply and stuff like that.

167
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
 I can close my place off.

168
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,200
 I feel really, really blessed that I'm in the position I'm in at the time that I'm in this position.

169
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,880
 My buddy, you know, he's in prison.

170
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,400
 He's in California prison right now.

171
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,920
 And I think, geez, like,

172
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,360
 but you know, you know, he's not really in that risk structure.

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
 He's a lot younger than me.

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,320
 He's a lot more fit than I am, but still I worry about him, you know, I worry about him, but

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,120
 my buddy isn't at risk of getting murdered by a group of people known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.

176
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,520
 So Takashi69, listen, man, I don't wish the coronavirus on anybody at all.

177
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
 I'm not even gonna make a joke about that.

178
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
 But dude, you're in some serious danger.

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,440
 I think you probably had a better chance in jail, honestly, but talk about,

180
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
 talk about what is it, the rock on the hard place, man.

181
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,840
 Coronavirus in a jail cell.

182
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,360
 You might not get that.

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
 Or, and he's from New York.

184
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
 So I think he's like, awesome, I'm gonna go back to New York City.

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
 I haven't read a newspaper in three weeks or ever because I'm illiterate.

186
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
 I'm a literate idiot.

187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,400
 And he's walking into the city.

188
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
 Why is everything so quiet?

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,360
 This is weird.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
 Better just go home.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
 I don't know, dude.

192
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,960
 I don't know.

193
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,760
 So anyways, that's the story of Takashi69.

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,520
 We will see what comes of that.

195
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 That's pretty dangerous.

196
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,680
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

197
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,600
 Now, our next story, again, I just came across it yesterday.

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
 This is all breaking news.

199
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
 I had a kind of different stories planned for today.

200
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
 Opening stories, at least.

201
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,960
 The ending story I've been working on for a while.

202
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,280
 As long, it was a request from a long time ago.

203
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,080
 It was a really good story.

204
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,400
 But anyways, let's go ahead and we are traveling to Los Angeles.

205
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
 So let's hop in.

206
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,600
 I got a complaint the other day from PriscillaKills on YouTube.

207
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,840
 She says, "How come you don't use the other vehicles anymore?"

208
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,040
 They have been in the garage lately.

209
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
 I'll make up some backstory for why.

210
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
 But let's hop in the Jason Jalopy.

211
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
 We are driving.

212
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
 You're like, "Jason, can we please take the helicopter?

213
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
 There's a pandemic everywhere."

214
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy.

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
 Now there's a roof and the windows are rolled up.

216
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
 It's really nice air conditioning.

217
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,840
 We are driving from wherever Tekashi-699 was.

218
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,000
 We're driving from a federal prison.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
 Because we don't know where he was at.

220
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
 It was a private prison.

221
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
 It was unlisted.

222
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
 That's at how risk this guy's life is.

223
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,840
 The government was hiding him.

224
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
 Because he was a federal witness.

225
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,640
 So they do have to kind of take care of him for a bit.

226
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
 But they still sentenced them.

227
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,840
 And then they're like, "Okay, you want to go out the door, dude."

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,840
 His face is covered in tattoos of the number 69.

229
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,520
 He's incredibly right.

230
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,400
 Anyways, okay.

231
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,880
 Anyways, anyways.

232
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
 Let's go ahead and we're leaving behind this undisclosed location.

233
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,960
 We're driving out to Los Angeles.

234
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
 This just happened March 31st.

235
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
 I'm honestly surprised this isn't a bigger news story.

236
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
 But I think it's because everything else that's going on.

237
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
 There's a lot of stuff going on.

238
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,800
 Tekashi-699 is the lead story of the day.

239
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
 March 31st, 2020.

240
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,480
 We're driving down to the port of Los Angeles and Los Angeles.

241
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,760
 So right now the United States, it's the USNS.

242
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
 Which I believe stands for United States Navy Ship.

243
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
 It's kind of weird because aren't they all Navy ships?

244
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,560
 You don't have like Air Force boats, right?

245
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,440
 I know the Navy has its own, the Marines has its own Air Force of helicopters.

246
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 And I think the Navy actually has its own Air Force as well.

247
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
 I don't think the Air Force,

248
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
 like the Air Force can land on.

249
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
 It's not like the Navy is like, "Ah, you can't use our aircraft carriers."

250
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
 And the planes are like, "Oh, come on, we're going to run out of fuel."

251
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,040
 Uh-oh, only Navy guys can land here.

252
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,800
 Air Force is like, "I should have joined the Navy."

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,160
 Is there planes, Cred?

254
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,320
 I'm sure they coordinate, but I think the Navy also has its own planes.

255
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,400
 I don't know.

256
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,040
 I know so little about so many different things.

257
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's mind boggling.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
 I know just enough.

259
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,920
 I know just enough.

260
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,680
 Anyway, so the Air Force, no, no, no, the Navy, the US,

261
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
 is it the US Navy ship?

262
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
 Maybe it's like US nurses station because it's a medical ship.

263
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
 It's only nurses though, no doctors.

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
 Doctors are like, "Can I come on board?"

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
 They're like, "Mm-mm, mm-mm."

266
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,400
 Oh, no, no, anyway, so USNS Mercy.

267
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
 It's a medical ship.

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
 Now, it's being brought in because of the coronavirus thing.

269
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 Now, what's, a lot of people get confused.

270
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,400
 It's not for coronavirus patients.

271
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,560
 It's for broken legs.

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
 It's for car accidents.

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
 It's for everything else.

274
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
 You having heart trouble?

275
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,080
 You're going to go to the boat.

276
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,320
 You have anything wrong with you.

277
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,120
 That's not coronavirus related because they don't want to just spread the infection.

278
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,760
 Hospitals are getting outfitted with all their stuff.

279
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,080
 They're getting all their PPE, ventilators.

280
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
 They're getting all that stuff.

281
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,520
 The boat is for everything else.

282
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,160
 So you get a car accident and you're headed to the mercy.

283
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
 But there's a man named Eduardo Moreno.

284
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
 He's 44 years old.

285
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,760
 I always think it's funny when people older than me do stupid stuff

286
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
 because I think you're an idiot.

287
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
 Like, I know better.

288
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,560
 You should too.

289
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,840
 You should too.

290
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,920
 Anyways, 44 years old.

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
 He runs a train.

292
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
 He's like a train guy.

293
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,080
 He's a train conductor.

294
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,360
 And he's riding this train one day.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,400
 He's like driving the train.

296
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
 Whatever the term is, right?

297
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,640
 He's in the thing of the train.

298
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,560
 The engine room, the control room is what I meant to say.

299
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,200
 Whatever.

300
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,520
 You know, you guys know what I'm talking about, right?

301
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
 I don't think he's the conductor.

302
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,480
 Isn't the conductor the dude who just has a little blue hat

303
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,840
 and he goes like, tickets please?

304
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,280
 Or is that the ticket guy?

305
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,880
 Like whenever I think of the conductor, I think of like just dude

306
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,440
 in a suit.

307
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
 Who's the guy who actually drives it?

308
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,920
 Like what you call him a driver?

309
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,600
 Anyways, the point is, is that Eduardo Moreno is the only,

310
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
 to be fair, he's the only guy on this train.

311
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
 He's the only guy on this train at the time.

312
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
 So it really doesn't matter what his title is.

313
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,920
 But he works at the train yard and something's been bugging him

314
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
 for weeks.

315
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
 Oh my God.

316
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,280
 I know something's not right about this whole U.S. Inness Mercy thing.

317
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,360
 This doesn't make sense.

318
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,200
 He's walking around his house.

319
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,000
 His wife is just trying to sit there, watch television.

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
 It doesn't make sense.

321
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
 Something's not right.

322
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,600
 We're being contained in our own houses and that just doesn't make sense.

323
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,880
 And then this boat pulls up.

324
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
 Something's not right.

325
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,480
 Something's not right.

326
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,360
 He's driving to work.

327
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,000
 I don't get it.

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
 Oh my God, that's something's not right.

329
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
 Trying to figure it out.

330
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,240
 He's eating soup.

331
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,720
 I don't get it.

332
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,640
 Delicious soup.

333
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,240
 But still, it doesn't make sense.

334
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
 Why would the boat be here?

335
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,240
 Wait.

336
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,920
 Oh, he's trying to sleep.

337
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
 Dodger Stadium.

338
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,760
 Dodger Stadium.

339
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,200
 He wakes up in the middle of the night.

340
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,960
 So this day, March 31st, he's driving.

341
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,040
 That's not an exaggeration, honestly.

342
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,960
 On March 31st, allegedly, though, I have to say that, we'll get to all this.

343
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,360
 On March 31st, he's driving this train.

344
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,760
 He has been obsessed with what's going on.

345
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
 And all of us have to a certain point.

346
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
 I've really pulled back because I sometimes, I'm starting to get like too scared.

347
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,720
 And then I just started reading headlines and I've been fine.

348
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,280
 It was when I was clicking on, I realized this.

349
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,760
 I go to two websites now for all my news, Fox News and CNN.com.

350
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,160
 Because Fox News has all the good news.

351
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,280
 And CNN.com has all the horrifying news.

352
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,960
 So in between the two, I can kind of find what's actually happening.

353
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,000
 Fox News is all about like cures and how the economy is going to come roaring back

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
 and all this stuff.

355
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 And then CNN is like, today a baby deer died of COVID-19.

356
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
 Here's footage of people more.

357
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
 And I'm like, I don't want to see that.

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,200
 I want to, I mean, I do want just the good news.

359
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
 But I know like I kind of need a little bit in the middle.

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,120
 Those two websites I go to.

361
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,480
 But CNN, I click on, I just kind of scan the headlines and they're like,

362
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
 did you know that Frosty the Snowman melted today?

363
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
 Because it's like, dude, yeah, I get it.

364
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,160
 There's going to be outliers.

365
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,040
 There's going to be really scary stuff that's going on with this thing.

366
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
 I kind of just want like general news.

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
 But Fox News is too much like it's going to, it's right around the corner guys.

368
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
 Just keep on waiting.

369
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,280
 So, and I kind of need more of that cheery thing.

370
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,960
 But anyway, so that's where I go for my news.

371
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,880
 I stopped going to most news sites.

372
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,560
 I really stopped reading a lot of stuff.

373
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 But this guy, Eduardo Moreno, believes he hasn't figured out.

374
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,480
 See, he's obsessed but on a different level.

375
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,360
 He's not obsessed so much about the health ramifications

376
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,880
 or the economic ramifications, which are my two big concerns.

377
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,200
 He's concerned about the conspiracy.

378
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
 Now, he doesn't specifically say what conspiracy theory he believes in.

379
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,160
 I did a lot of reading on this.

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
 I was trying to figure out if it was QAnon.

381
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,760
 Some people, I've seen people pop up that this has to do with 5G

382
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
 that we're actually, there's no coronavirus.

383
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,920
 This is the effects of 5G technology.

384
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,440
 The beams going through our body.

385
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,920
 Oh, it actually has the same symptoms as coronavirus.

386
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,080
 Jorge on YouTube actually pointed out that there's a conspiracy theory that

387
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
 while we are all locked in, they're building 5G everywhere.

388
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,800
 Like this was all just a ruse to get us to hide so they can put 5G towers everywhere.

389
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,600
 So there's a whole 5G, the phone.

390
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,520
 I'm talking about 5G like the phone towers,

391
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
 you know your cell phone right now is like 3G or 4G.

392
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
 5G is the new one.

393
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
 The waves are supposed to be much smaller.

394
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
 I did a whole episode on it a while back.

395
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,440
 It's complete nonsense.

396
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,360
 But anyways, I was really hoping I could figure out which conspiracy theory he believed in.

397
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,240
 But I couldn't.

398
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,320
 But it doesn't matter because he decided to take action.

399
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
 He's running that train.

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,560
 And he's just, it's actually just a normal day at work for him on March 31st.

401
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,840
 But then he eventually gets interviewed by the FBI.

402
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,640
 So if you don't know this story, here's a little flash forward to you.

403
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 You're like, would you just tell me what happens?

404
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
 Why are you the absolute bizarre story structure?

405
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,600
 He's getting interviewed, a flash forward.

406
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
 And he's getting interviewed by the FBI.

407
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,160
 And they ask him, did you plan this?

408
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,680
 And here's his quote.

409
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,400
 Here's his quote.

410
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
 I don't know.

411
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,640
 Sometimes you just get a little snap and man, it was freaking exciting.

412
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,320
 I just had it and I was committed.

413
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
 I just went for it.

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
 I had one chance.

415
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 Unquote.

416
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,360
 So he didn't have like a mental breakdown.

417
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
 He was just focused.

418
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
 This thing was going through his head all this time.

419
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,800
 And this boat, the US NS Mercy, is at the end of his railroad track.

420
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,720
 Destiny?

421
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,360
 Destiny?

422
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,560
 That put him on that train on that day.

423
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,120
 Now it's not like the train track went into the sea.

424
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,320
 The train track ended and then, you know, probably about 300 some odd yards away from

425
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
 the train track is the boat.

426
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,080
 Trains coming.

427
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 Chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica

428
00:19:36,080 --> 00:20:01,440
 Here's another quote from his interview afterwards.

429
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
 You went to Dodger Stadium.

430
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
 We might not be able to go again.

431
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,000
 Trains getting closer to the end of the line.

432
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,360
 Train derails.

433
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
 Smashes through a concrete barrier.

434
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,200
 Dust and rock going everywhere.

435
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,440
 Sparks, I guess that wasn't in the newspaper.

436
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
 But I'm assuming shooting everywhere.

437
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,920
 The train is sliding to a stop.

438
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,320
 Slides to a stop 250 yards from the US NS Mercy boat.

439
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
 Now at the same time, there's the same time.

440
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,480
 As if things aren't complicated enough at the exact same time.

441
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,720
 There's a California Highway Patrol officer sitting in his car, right?

442
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,760
 He's probably like, "Finally, out of the station.

443
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 Totally socially isolated.

444
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,920
 I can be by myself.

445
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,080
 What a peaceful LA day."

446
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,280
 Just the giant train goes derailing.

447
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,360
 Shooting everything up.

448
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,280
 He freaks out.

449
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,680
 Now he's sitting in his car and he watched.

450
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,640
 I would love to see the dash cam footage of this thing.

451
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
 Because we haven't seen any yet.

452
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,200
 There was footage.

453
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
 There was footage from inside the cabin, all that stuff.

454
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,040
 But the train derails.

455
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,840
 And your first instinct is going to be accident.

456
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,320
 You're never going to think someone did this on purpose.

457
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,800
 Right?

458
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,640
 Your first instinct, that was a 9/11/2.

459
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 Remember we were like, "Oh my god, what a tragic accident.

460
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,400
 Like a plane crashing into the World Trade Center.

461
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,280
 That's horrible."

462
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
 And then like 40 minutes later you're like, "Ugh.

463
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,680
 The second one didn't seem like an accident."

464
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,480
 But so anyways, the point is that you think it's an accident first.

465
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,680
 And then he sees a guy jump out and start running away.

466
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,640
 So the cop goes, "Wait a second.

467
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,920
 If it was an accident, generally I've seen a lot of accidents in my life.

468
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,600
 From California Highway Patrol.

469
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,360
 Usually people don't get out of their car and go running,

470
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
 unless they did something wrong in that accident scene.

471
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,720
 So the cop gets out and starts chasing them, catches them, arrests them.

472
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
 There's no damage to the boat.

473
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,120
 250 yards is quite a long way.

474
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,360
 Right?

475
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
 That's two and a half football fields.

476
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
 American football fields.

477
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,000
 I don't know how big a soccer field is.

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,920
 And he catches them.

479
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,880
 There's a bunch of fuel everywhere, but nothing explodes.

480
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
 There's no giant awesome explosion.

481
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,680
 No one is injured at all.

482
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,160
 And what happens is he gets arrested by the cops.

483
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,280
 The cops are like, "Yo, yo, yo.

484
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,320
 I don't think he got arrested.

485
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 If they're like, "You, sir, you're under arrest."

486
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,360
 He was an accident.

487
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,560
 They detain him.

488
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
 He confesses.

489
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
 He says that he did it.

490
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,560
 And then he starts saying why he did it.

491
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,840
 So the cop's called the feds.

492
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
 And this is the thing.

493
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,040
 This is really where I was getting to.

494
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,600
 I know there was kind of a long theater of the mind.

495
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,080
 Do you like that?

496
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
 Did you picture the dust from my amazing visuals?

497
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,080
 He's being charged with terrorism.

498
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,520
 He's facing 20 years in prison for this.

499
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,240
 Which I imagine he'll get at least half of that.

500
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
 Right now, everyone's real...

501
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,160
 Like if you spit on someone, you can get charged with terrorism.

502
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,560
 So I know everyone's kind of on edge.

503
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,960
 And not only the fact that he committed terrorism, but he tried...

504
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
 Some people say he was trying to smash into the boat.

505
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,160
 He could have just been trying to draw attention to the area and get his word out.

506
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,280
 But it almost seems to me that he was trying to smash the boat

507
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
 because he thinks something nefarious is going on.

508
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,880
 I don't know if he thought he would smash the boat and a bunch of armed soldiers would spill out.

509
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
 Like they're all crammed into it like a beehive.

510
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 And then we realized that this was a military takeover.

511
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
 Or he'd crash into the boat and a bunch of sprint phones would come out.

512
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
 And everyone's like, "Oh my God, it's 5G. It's real. It's real."

513
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,360
 Who knows?

514
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,880
 We don't know. He'd crash into it and a giant letter Q rolls out.

515
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,920
 We don't know.

516
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,240
 The point is, is that all of these conspiracy theories that we kind of laugh and talk about...

517
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
 Some people...

518
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:04,400
 This is a reminder, a constant reminder, that some people take this stuff super seriously.

519
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,040
 Like there's different layers of it.

520
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,720
 I think there's people who use it just to get money.

521
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,680
 Who people who put out fake conspiracy theories 100% to get money.

522
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,360
 And then I believe there's a smaller amount of people who do it because they're actually trying to expose a truth.

523
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
 I think most people are in it for the money.

524
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
 I think most people are in it for the money.

525
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
 I think the second level down is larpers.

526
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,760
 I think people who don't believe it at all, you find them all over the internet.

527
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
 They do it because they think it's funny.

528
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
 They like scaring people.

529
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
 They like tricking people.

530
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,840
 I think a good amount of the conspiracy theory community actually is talking about it ironically.

531
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,920
 But you don't pick up on that.

532
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,840
 I honestly believe that.

533
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,240
 And I think underneath that you have the people who super believe in it.

534
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
 I think those would be the things.

535
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
 You have the people who make money doing it.

536
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,080
 So yeah, I think those are the different levels.

537
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,080
 I think most conspiracy theorists are trying to figure out a way to monetize it in some way, in some fashion.

538
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,000
 And then you have a bunch of larpers.

539
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,800
 And actually those two might kind of be blurred.

540
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,440
 You could have larpers who are like, "Oh, this is a cash cow."

541
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,160
 Like when I did my episode recently about is Ellen DeGeneres eating kids.

542
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,240
 It was one of my biggest episodes in months.

543
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,120
 Huge spike in downloads.

544
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,240
 Huge spike in views.

545
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,240
 And whenever I do an episode about Kevin Spacey, it's always like double or triple the amount of my normal views.

546
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,960
 And I remember a long time ago when I first did an episode on Kevin Spacey, because like I was so weird,

547
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,600
 did an episode on Kevin Spacey and my viewership shot up completely.

548
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 I remember that was kind of what that was early in the show.

549
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
 It was probably like the first six months of the show.

550
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,720
 I thought to myself, I could at this point cancel Dead Rabbit Radio,

551
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,760
 start a show where I unironically talked about this stuff.

552
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,280
 Like I love conspiracy theories.

553
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,240
 I love discussing them.

554
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,280
 I think they're fascinating, but I don't believe them.

555
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,640
 I don't believe them.

556
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,760
 There are some that I do believe, but for the most, like most of it I think is absolutely foolish.

557
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,200
 It's entertaining.

558
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
 It talks a lot about where we're at as a society.

559
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,600
 I find conspiracy theories as fascinating as other people find like fables or myths and things like that.

560
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,040
 I think they're modern day mythology.

561
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,720
 But I remember when that first Kevin Spacey video came out,

562
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,000
 I thought I could stop doing Dead Rabbit Radio right now or completely change my tone and talk about this stuff like it's 100%.

563
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,760
 And I would make bank.

564
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,920
 I could actually make money doing this show.

565
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,800
 If I talked about these conspiracy theories, talked about this Illuminati bloodline stuff,

566
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,360
 as if it was true knowing that it's not,

567
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,760
 I could make a ton of money because I obviously can obviously find those right keywords and stuff like that.

568
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 And I didn't, I remember that I spent a weekend thinking about it and I go,

569
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,880
 you know, you could, you know, there's a void right now.

570
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,800
 Alex Jones getting run out of the platform.

571
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,240
 Yeah, it was a while back ago.

572
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,480
 You could change up your show.

573
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
 I don't even think I spent a weekend thinking about it.

574
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,040
 I think I spent a night thinking about it and I thought I'd be miserable.

575
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,480
 I'd be miserable.

576
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,680
 I'd be putting too much bad stuff out into the world.

577
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,880
 And you don't believe it.

578
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,080
 There are some conspiracy theories that I do believe and I've talked about those on the show,

579
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,560
 some of them.

580
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,320
 And yeah, I was like, no, I'd rather talk about,

581
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,600
 I'd rather talk about Mormon, Bigfoot and Popobawa and all sorts of nonsense.

582
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,400
 And then so, but I still get that when I do an episode like

583
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,560
 is Ellen DeGeneres eating kids massive downloads.

584
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,760
 And of course, I'm sure most of those people are completely disappointed because I said no.

585
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,120
 No. So anyways, there are people out here who take this stuff so seriously,

586
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,200
 they're willing to injure themselves, definitely.

587
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,160
 But it's possible that he could have hurt someone else.

588
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,840
 So, but people believe in that people will knock on the doors of families of Sandy Hook,

589
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,040
 people, victims, people will knock on the doors of people who had victims who died at the movie

590
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,720
 theater shooting in Aurora.

591
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,040
 You'll see people getting harassed because they don't believe your pet conspiracy theory.

592
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,640
 But we'll see all sorts of stuff.

593
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
 We'll really, really buy into this stuff.

594
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,920
 And it's sad this guy threw his life away, threw his life away 20 years,

595
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,520
 even if he only got 10 because of a moment in time.

596
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,480
 He has a family too.

597
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,200
 His wife started to go fund me and was like, I don't know what to do.

598
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,280
 This guy threw his life away and ruined his family.

599
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,600
 All the pain and suffering he has to put his wife in

600
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,560
 because he had a thing in his head about Dodger Stadium not reopening up.

601
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,400
 Got to remember there's a lot of entertainment value to this,

602
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,120
 but you can't take it seriously because trust me,

603
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,600
 most of the people you think are taking it seriously are larping.

604
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 And you may be getting tricked.

605
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,320
 Now, I think actually my audience, I think you guys are smarter than that.

606
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,160
 I think you guys have been like, yeah, you're checking to watch for late,

607
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,560
 dude, you've been preaching at us for five minutes, but I think you guys are pretty,

608
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
 pretty savvy.

609
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
 You get the score.

610
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
 You know that this stuff is entertaining and it's crazy.

611
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,480
 People believe this stuff.

612
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,880
 Now, talk about crazy believe.

613
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
 It's funny because all of that stuff, now let's talk about a monster.

614
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
 Let's talk about this is going to be a long episode.

615
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,920
 Let's talk about a monster that may have eaten people.

616
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,000
 And now see again, that stuff that I think is fine to believe in ghost and monsters

617
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,280
 and UFOs and stuff like that.

618
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,400
 Because there's a really effect how you interact with other people.

619
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,680
 But if you have a conspiracy theory where X is the enemy,

620
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,440
 you are the bad guy because you're part of this Illuminati blood drinking cult

621
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,120
 that affects how you deal with other people or other groups of people

622
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,240
 or other religions or cultures or politicians, whatever.

623
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
 Whether or not you believe in ghosts, really doesn't matter.

624
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,800
 So let's go ahead.

625
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,720
 We're going to park the J.C.

626
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,360
 Jalopy.

627
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,200
 We are now hopping in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

628
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
 We're using all sorts of vehicles today.

629
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,000
 We are going to row, well, technically, you're going to row all the way from Los Angeles.

630
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,560
 We're headed out to Pensacola, Florida.

631
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,160
 Now this was a request a long time ago from Andrew via Gmail.

632
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,960
 Long time ago.

633
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,280
 I think, like, I think I was 40 episodes in.

634
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,880
 He's like, "Hey, man, should cover this.

635
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,920
 Sorry it took me so long.

636
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,040
 I do find it fascinating.

637
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
 Just kind of got lost in my notes."

638
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,520
 It's March 24th, 1962.

639
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
 We're in Pensacola, Florida.

640
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,520
 There's a young man named Edward Brian McCleary.

641
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,400
 He's 16 years old and he has four friends.

642
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,360
 We don't have their names.

643
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
 So I guess you can figure what happens to them.

644
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,160
 Now they like to go diving.

645
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
 They're like, "Hey, let's do this boring thing."

646
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,560
 I never understood the idea of diving.

647
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,160
 Diving.

648
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,600
 I'd rather go caving and I don't want to do that either.

649
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 But diving is basically caving.

650
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,520
 But it's just all like, think about it.

651
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
 Diving is basically just digging in the earth.

652
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,480
 It's the same thing.

653
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,960
 Except when you dig, like, let's say if I just laid on the ground and started digging with my hands.

654
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,720
 It's the same thing as swimming, right?

655
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
 And then you kind of like, it's fast.

656
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,960
 It's obviously faster to swim.

657
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,040
 Because if you're like, "Hey, let's swim for 100 yards deep."

658
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,520
 And you'd be like, "Uh, can you go 100 yards deep?

659
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,240
 That's pretty deep."

660
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,560
 Anyways, it's the same thing.

661
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,160
 But it's just different substance.

662
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,840
 You're like, "Jesus, it's not even close to the same thing."

663
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,760
 Whatever hang up you have about, what diving sucks?

664
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
 Why is this even a rant?

665
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,080
 I just don't like, I don't like swimming in general.

666
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,400
 Anyways, the point is, it's like,

667
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
 so I'm already judging these guys.

668
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,960
 Edward and his four friends, they take a raft out.

669
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
 Now they're going to go diving.

670
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,760
 There's a battleship in the Pensacola Bay called the USS Massachusetts.

671
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,400
 USS Massachusetts.

672
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,120
 And it was scuttled back in 1921.

673
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,200
 And they're doing this thing called skin diving,

674
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,320
 which I believe means they're wearing human skin while they do it.

675
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,080
 I don't think they have any scuba gear, right?

676
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
 Isn't that skin diving?

677
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
 They're just jumping in.

678
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
 So anyways, wee splash.

679
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,560
 And they're like swimming around the boat.

680
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,760
 Hey, look at this.

681
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,360
 Here's like this rusted part.

682
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,040
 No way, Billy, look at this.

683
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,280
 To be fair, they can't talk underwater.

684
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,040
 But I mean, yeah, you look down.

685
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,320
 Oh no, this part's rusted.

686
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
 And then you come up and get some oxygen.

687
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
 Or maybe they had tanks out.

688
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
 I probably have been sitting on this story for a year.

689
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
 And I don't know basic facts about it.

690
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,440
 Doesn't matter.

691
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,800
 Anyways, they're swimming around.

692
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,440
 They're pointing out rusted stuff to their buddies.

693
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,160
 Doing all this stuff.

694
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,760
 Now a storm hits.

695
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:18,880
 That's rain.

696
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
 That's not a bunch of ants coming.

697
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,160
 And they're like, hey, let's get back on the raft.

698
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,400
 Right?

699
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,440
 We should raft home.

700
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,960
 Now I imagine it's like--

701
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,640
 Again, I probably should have done some more research.

702
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,120
 Well, to be fair, this story is from 1962.

703
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
 So I don't think they had photos.

704
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,760
 But when they keep saying raft, I keep imagining it's like

705
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
 castaways raft.

706
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,160
 They took a bunch of twigs and twine and built this thing.

707
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,440
 But raft can also be one of those yellow inflatable things,

708
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,560
 which it probably was.

709
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,720
 Probably wasn't just loose pieces of wood.

710
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,480
 But anyways, so they come back up to the raft.

711
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,560
 Now they're sitting in the middle of the sea,

712
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,840
 really kind of in the middle of nowhere.

713
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,240
 They didn't scuttle this thing right next to the coast.

714
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,080
 And it starts to get dark.

715
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
 And the storms still come in.

716
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
 So now they're like, OK, we should probably go back at this point.

717
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,920
 Right?

718
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,480
 Probably shouldn't be swimming around this big hunk of junk.

719
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
 Let's go back.

720
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,320
 But then they see something in the water.

721
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,760
 Just kind of cutting lines through the already turbulent sea.

722
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,800
 What in the world was that?

723
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,680
 They see it again.

724
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,240
 All five teens are kind of peering into the darkness.

725
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,520
 It was described as quote,

726
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,080
 "There's like a telephone pole about 10 feet high with a bulb on top."

727
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,080
 So it was basically this giant long neck.

728
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,240
 And they could see a little bulb, supposedly the head.

729
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,760
 So basically what you would picture as a classic sea monster,

730
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,680
 like a Nessie or like the Brontosaurus with flippers,

731
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,840
 whatever that thing was called, Brontoflippers.

732
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,880
 Kind of classic sea monster.

733
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
 Right?

734
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
 It's what you think of when you see a sea monster.

735
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,480
 Now you go, Jason, don't you hate sea monsters?

736
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,880
 And I do.

737
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
 I think they're super boring.

738
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,120
 And that's why I never talk about them.

739
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,080
 But not this one.

740
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,920
 This one's pretty dope.

741
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,840
 And it's coming.

742
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,400
 It's kind of cutting through the water.

743
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,360
 And as it's getting closer,

744
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,560
 they're kind of able to get a visualization on it.

745
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,360
 Skin was greenish brown.

746
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,520
 It had a head like a sea turtle.

747
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,520
 And a mouth full of teeth.

748
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,440
 And you go, Jason, didn't you just say it was nighttime

749
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,040
 and there was a storm going on earlier?

750
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,640
 How are they getting such a good look at it?

751
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,000
 Because...

752
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,800
 The creature bites into one of the men.

753
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
 No, not me.

754
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,880
 I was hoping I would die last.

755
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,560
 And it pulls him underwater.

756
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,320
 The other four teens go, swim for the boat,

757
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360
 swim for the boat.

758
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,880
 Because they're like in this raft, right?

759
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,040
 You're not going to stand the chance.

760
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,960
 Now there's like a giant mast.

761
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
 So where the boat crashed,

762
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,920
 where the USS Massachusetts got scuttled,

763
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,480
 there was like 26 feet of a mast sticking out of the ground.

764
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,360
 The boat's real.

765
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,400
 Whether or not any of these other details are,

766
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,680
 we'll get into that in a second.

767
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,480
 The boat actually, I did check on that.

768
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,840
 There was boat actually was scuttled.

769
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,280
 I don't know if there's still 26 feet of metal sticking out of the bay.

770
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,840
 But anyways, so they jump out of the raft and they're swimming.

771
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,160
 They figure this thing's head is about 10 feet tall.

772
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,480
 This mast goes up 25 feet.

773
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
 We have a fighting chance.

774
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,640
 So they're swimming, swimming.

775
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,280
 And as they're swimming,

776
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
 eats another one.

777
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:48,960
 No!

778
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,600
 Three teens swimming.

779
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,480
 One's dog paddling.

780
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,280
 He's not going to make it.

781
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
 No!

782
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,600
 Two teens left.

783
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,120
 Edward and his buddy who his parents never even named.

784
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,560
 The poor kid 16 years old.

785
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,440
 He never got a name.

786
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,280
 Monster eats him as well.

787
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,480
 Edward stays on the mast till sunrise.

788
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,000
 It's a big old boat coming by.

789
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,120
 A honk on their horn.

790
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,920
 If you couldn't tell.

791
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,440
 And Edward is rescued the next day.

792
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
 Now,

793
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:45,440
 he goes, he tells people the story that his four buddies were murdered one by one by this monster.

794
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,640
 And he was the only survivor.

795
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,520
 And later, one of his friends, his body was actually found cause of death drowning.

796
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,040
 So I don't know if they noticed the 52 large puncture marks in his side where the monster got him.

797
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,360
 Cause of death drowning.

798
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,080
 At that point, he drew pictures of what the monster looked like to sketch pictures of the monster.

799
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,840
 And at a certain point in his life, he just kind of stopped telling the story about this.

800
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,320
 Like he told it obviously, hey, what happened to my son?

801
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,520
 Was any hanging out with you yesterday?

802
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,360
 You got to tell the story then.

803
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,760
 But over time, he just clammed up about it.

804
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
 They don't want to tell it anymore.

805
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,360
 Passed away in 2016.

806
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,920
 Thank you for the recommendation, Andrew.

807
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,880
 I really appreciate it.

808
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,040
 It does sound made up, right?

809
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
 There's a couple of different things that are going on.

810
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,920
 The one thing is, this is not a completely obscure monster story,

811
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,640
 but it's also not super well known.

812
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
 It's definitely dated.

813
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,160
 It was more well known in the decades past.

814
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,880
 There's only one source of material of the story I could find.

815
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,760
 There have been articles written about it since where people are like, well,

816
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,680
 remember that story so you may find articles in magazines or newspapers referencing it.

817
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
 But at the time, there was no newspaper.

818
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,800
 Four Pinsicle of Boys found like gone missing.

819
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,960
 Four Pinsicle of Boys, gone missing.

820
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,440
 Couple days later, Boy found.

821
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,040
 Other three bodies never returned.

822
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,800
 Stuff like that.

823
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,840
 Really, the original source story was Fate Magazine.

824
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,560
 Fate Magazine.

825
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,040
 It was a magazine which is basically the equivalent of Dead Rabbit Radio back in the day,

826
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,240
 except far less skeptical.

827
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,600
 I think it would probably be more the equivalent of say, Coast to Coast AM.

828
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,480
 It covered bizarre stuff, 40 and stuff.

829
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,360
 Stories of the paranormal.

830
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
 I have a bunch of issues actually.

831
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,600
 It's a pretty good magazine.

832
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,440
 But the thing is, is like, you gotta wonder about the editorial review of it.

833
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,960
 And the thing is too, with a magazine that long in production,

834
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,600
 sometimes they'll go through time periods where they're actually have like a lot of true stuff.

835
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,520
 And then, you know, you kind of got to boost the sale numbers and stuff could get a little more iffy.

836
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,720
 So, they could be going through their own Kevin Spacey moment back in a certain time period.

837
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,040
 And they're like, "Whoa, this article made a lot of money.

838
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,760
 This issue sold a bunch because we have this on the cover.

839
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,640
 Let's hype up this.

840
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,360
 Let's hype up this."

841
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,000
 So anyways, you definitely have that.

842
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,760
 The only real original source of the story was Fate Magazine.

843
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,600
 In 1965, it was Volume 18, Issue 5.

844
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,880
 It was an article written by Edward Brian McCleary.

845
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,400
 And it was called My Escape from a Sea Monster.

846
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,880
 Now, I wasn't able to find that original story because that's such an old copy of that magazine.

847
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
 But short fiction?

848
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,000
 I mean, is it possible that this guy just simply wrote a short story, submitted it to Fate Magazine,

849
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,880
 and got it published, and then he talked about it for a while, and then eventually he goes,

850
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
 "Whoa, like people actually believe in this thing?

851
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,600
 That's possible."

852
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:46,880
 It's, that's honestly more possible than four people going missing,

853
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,080
 getting eaten one by one.

854
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,280
 And there being no police reports at the time, no news coverage at the time.

855
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,600
 Even the Edward know it, even if you had four people going missing and Edward making these

856
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,840
 statements, that would be news at that time.

857
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,040
 We've covered a lot of stuff, a lot of like old news.

858
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,000
 This story we did recently, the past two days about R.O. Reigns.

859
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,520
 Like that was in the news.

860
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,120
 The guy just said, "Oh, I went on a UFO."

861
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,680
 And he, that published the news twice.

862
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,560
 Such a great article.

863
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
 They republished it a couple months later.

864
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,920
 So you think when it would involve actual proof, people missing, body being found,

865
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,160
 that it would be covered.

866
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,760
 The thing I like about the story is that it's basically a bridge between the two.

867
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,000
 We have stories about cryptids.

868
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,240
 We have stories about monster sightings, right?

869
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,080
 And then we have stories about mysterious disappearances.

870
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,440
 You have those two stories all the time, the cryptid sightings and the mysterious

871
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,160
 disappearances. This story bridges them and directly connects a sea monster, a cryptid,

872
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,080
 to disappearances.

873
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,600
 The reason why they're not here is because this monster got him.

874
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,360
 Now, that's fascinating.

875
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 Because I think a lot of people who do read about stuff like missing 411,

876
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,960
 that's the idea that people go missing in national parks and there's a giant cover

877
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,360
 up by the government because something's going on in the park.

878
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,960
 Some people believe it's Bigfoot.

879
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
 Some people believe it's some sort of colt.

880
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,840
 Some people believe it's some sort of demonic or interdimensional portal activity, stuff like that.

881
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,720
 It's basically whatever boogeyman you want is in the national parks.

882
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,240
 This story kind of exists in that realm.

883
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
 And it's not common.

884
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,320
 Surprisingly, these stories aren't very common.

885
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,320
 We don't have a lot of reports of people running out of the bushes being like,

886
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,160
 "Oh my god, everyone I just hung out with is dead. Bigfoot got him."

887
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,840
 This is super rare and I think the reason why is because they'd be very, very easy to disprove.

888
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,560
 Very easy to disprove.

889
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,600
 If a story like that happened today, people would immediately start seeing,

890
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,080
 "Did anyone actually go missing from that town?"

891
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,680
 But if people just go missing, like the Yuba County 5 or the Yotlov Pass,

892
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,440
 where there's just mysterious deaths, you're able to assign that.

893
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,480
 When you have a witness come forth and say, "It was a monster."

894
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,080
 It's either fake and you can immediately disprove that,

895
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,840
 because there are no reports of missing people, or it's real and we've never had a case of that.

896
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,360
 As far as I can tell, we've never had a case of someone running back to civilization and saying,

897
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,520
 "Everyone I know is just killed by a monster and the authority is going out there and finding

898
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,720
 five mutilated people."

899
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,440
 Or just the people went missing completely and the person never changes their story.

900
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,960
 The monster showed up from the woods.

901
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,000
 It's funny that I say that because you would think that has happened, right?

902
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,600
 But is that just from the horror movies that we've watched?

903
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,240
 Like, it's kind of weird now that I say that it's weird that this is the only time I've ever heard

904
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,120
 this story of five people go out, one person comes back and says, "A monster killed everyone else."

905
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,480
 I can't recall another story where there was a survivor from a monster attack.

906
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,320
 So this story, I mean, this story, it's possibly fiction, because again,

907
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,920
 we have no missing reports of these people.

908
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,200
 We don't even have their names.

909
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,440
 So we can do that background check.

910
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,520
 But it is terrifying.

911
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,960
 The implication is terrifying, because then it does create that bridge.

912
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,680
 Whenever we have the people go, "Yeah, I saw something fly around my house.

913
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,160
 Saw this, I saw this, I saw a monster come in to try to take my kid."

914
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,400
 We talked about that, the Illinois Batman tried to steal a kid, but they didn't.

915
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,840
 See, if he had stolen the kid, we would have missing people reports and all this stuff.

916
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,680
 Tried to steal the kid.

917
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,960
 This story actually has that horror movie element, one survivor, a monster kills the rest of them.

918
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,760
 And really, then you have the horror movie element where no one believes them.

919
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,600
 Because here we are over 40 years later, 50 years later,

920
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,560
 and you still have me going like, "I don't know if it's true."

921
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:56,480
 This is a story that my gut tells me isn't true, but it could be.

922
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,520
 It could be that just no one believed him, the only way he could get the story out was

923
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,200
 "Fate Magazine," a magazine that ran stories on UFOs and creatures from beyond.

924
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,920
 So is it possible that there are monsters out there that are killing us?

925
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:20,640
 And if so, is it possible that someone could get away and tell us that story, even if we didn't

926
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,040
 believe it?

927
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,120
 Tell us that he was the only survivor that all of his friends were killed.

928
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,520
 The fact that we don't have a lot of these stories tells me one of two things.

929
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,240
 One, they're fake, and most people know it would be really hard to carry on that fake for a long time.

930
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,720
 Or they're rare.

931
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:45,440
 Because these creatures, these monsters, these cryptids are hunters.

932
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,880
 And it is so rare when a victim gets away.

933
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,360
 They just keep hunting.

934
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,080
 People just keep disappearing.

935
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,360
 And they remain a myth.
