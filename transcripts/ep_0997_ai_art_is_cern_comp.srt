1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 A cursed college campus claims more victims.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,480
 When a professional hitman sees crimes worse than his being committed, he decides to take

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
 the law into his own hands.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,680
 And then we travel into the world of AI art.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,480
 It's currently taking the world by storm whether you need a book cover or you just want an

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,240
 image of an anime chick with huge boobs, AI art is where it's at.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,880
 But when you request a brand new piece of art to be created for you, are you actually

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,200
 reaching into an alternate universe?

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:56,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

12

 This is episode like 996, we're four episodes away from episode 1000 and I'll tell you guys

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,400
 right now, I got no special plans for it.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,480
 It's hard enough just doing regular episodes, it's hard enough coming up with stuff regularly

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,480
 so it's just gonna be just a normal episode but thank you so much for being part of this

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,280
 journey, it's fantastic.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,120
 We are doing a Christmas livestream that's going to be December 25th at 12pm pacific

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,360
 standard time so maybe we'll do something there.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,040
 Maybe I'll eat cake on the mic and irritate everybody.

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,320
 But join us for the Christmas, do people eat cake at, I think people eat pie at Christmas.

 Rex let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hovercraft.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,960
 We're gonna take this one out of storage, haven't used it in a while, glide us all the

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,040
 way out to Irvine California.

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:55,880
 Now this is actually a follow up to an episode I did a while back but if you didn't hear

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,920
 that episode it's totally fine we'll do a quick review, fascinating story, fascinating

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
 update.

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,520
 It was episode 912, it was titled The Suicide Machine and it talked about the University

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,960
 of California Irvine.

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,240
 What happened was I was researching a ghost story about this ballerina who was really

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,960
 trying to get the lead part in the ballet, she's like I gotta be the one who stands on

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,640
 my tippy toes for 3 hours, it has to be me.

45
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,560
 But she didn't get the part, she's like aw man I guess my feet aren't gonna be bloody

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:35,880
 for weeks on end and she was depressed so she, as I'm starting to laugh, as I'm starting

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 to laugh this story takes a tragic turn, she hangs herself, well here's the thing, so

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,760
 people didn't know that she didn't get the part and her neighbors would look into her

49
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,920
 dorm and they would see her practicing all day long, she was constantly spinning, she

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,320
 was constantly spinning around and they're like wow, she's really really hoping to get

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,880
 that role, that's weird though I thought auditions were 2 weeks ago but she's still practicing,

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,400
 maybe she's getting ready for the show.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,480
 People noticed that she was practicing day and night, the only thing is she was only

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,240
 practicing the same move, the spinny move.

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,640
 Well it turns out she hung herself from her ceiling fan and what they thought she was

56
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,080
 spinning it was actually the ceiling fan going around and around.

57
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,880
 Now obviously that's an urban legend, you could obviously tell the difference between

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,640
 a ballerina spinning on one toe versus a body going whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo, flipping

59
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,720
 around like a stooge with their tie caught in a ceiling fan, you could obviously be like

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,800
 wow she really has those moves down, she's defined the laws of gravity, she's been doing

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,720
 it for about 12 hours now.

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
 But that got me to look at, that's an urban legend that comes out of UC Irvine, but UC

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,160
 Irvine does actually have a serious suicide problem, which is something I discovered when

64
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,480
 I was researching this urban legend.

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,680
 There was an article written for the OC Weekly, there's a great article written by Charles

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:12,560
 Lamb and the article is titled "Why Do So Many Students Commit Suicide at UC Irvine's

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,920
 Social Science Plaza?"

68
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,200
 And Charles Lamb paints this picture so you have this campus, there was supposed to be

69
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,880
 this symbol of balance between nature and the modern world.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,160
 You had this perfect balance the way everything was laid out, but in the middle of it they

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
 built the social sciences building and actually they said the buildings are in this weird

72
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
 clockwise formation actually.

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,360
 When you're walking around UC Irvine you feel everything is so open and breezy and you can

74
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,320
 sense the intent behind the architecture.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,040
 So when you enter the social sciences plaza and every student has to take at least one

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,640
 class here, just the way the classes are laid out, it's not like the dean is like "let's

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,440
 see if you can survive one semester here."

78
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,880
 You walk in there and everything starts to feel very claustrophobic and not like in

79
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,760
 a spooky way, it's not like you go there and there's dark shadows walking on, although

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,280
 those might be there as well.

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,280
 They say that it's more closed off, there's something like architecturally wrong about

82
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 it, it really throws off the balance of the campus.

83
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,800
 And they have so many suicides, so what happens is you have these buildings with these, there's

84
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,640
 five buildings there, these five multi-story buildings, and they have these exterior staircases.

85
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,560
 They have interior ones as well and I'm assuming elevators, but they have these exterior staircases

86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,040
 and on each landing there's a sign that says "don't kill yourself."

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,400
 That's not verbatim, that's not the quote, but it's like "there's help out there, here's

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,880
 a phone number, don't kill yourself."

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,880
 And those signs are on each floor, but what happens is people keep jumping off the exterior

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
 staircases of these buildings and killing themselves during the school day.

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,200
 And some of these people aren't even students.

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,760
 Some of these people like travel here, walk up the staircase and jump off.

93
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,920
 And nobody really knows why.

94
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 Nobody really knows why.

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,240
 It was interesting because Charles Lamb, this is obviously a paranormal podcast, I'm

96
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,000
 a paranormal researcher, so I started talking about maybe there's something here harnessing

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 the dark energy.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,280
 Like Jason, that was really tacky, now that you remind me of that.

99
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
 That's pretty callous.

100
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,440
 I know, I know, but I was like maybe there's something here harnessing this dark energy.

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:55,920
 You see Irvine was created when the niece of Myford Irvine killed himself.

102
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,200
 And then the entire Irvine, because Irvine was this family of very prominent real estate

103
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,320
 developers back in the day, Myford Irvine killed himself and his niece who took over

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,940
 everything, she was really the last living person, she donated like a thousand acres

105
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,040
 to build this.

106
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,720
 So the college itself in a way came out of a tragic suicide.

107
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,600
 I kind of went with this paranormal angle, maybe a little bit of a mad scientist angle

108
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 in there.

109
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,560
 And I said, why are people killing themselves here?

110
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,600
 Charles Lamb, Charles Lamb wasn't having any of that nonsense.

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
 He didn't say that.

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,280
 And it's interesting because the school themselves, like the school spokespeople, they're just

113
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,440
 like they don't even like to acknowledge this stuff.

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,440
 They don't even like to acknowledge it.

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,240
 It happens.

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
 We just go on with the day.

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,080
 Like people will kill themselves and they'll kind of like rope it off and the ambulance

118
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
 shows up.

119
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,360
 But there's no like, sometimes there are, but a lot of times there's no like candlelight

120
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,480
 vigil or memorial put up or anything like that.

121
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,920
 Someone kills themselves.

122
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
 Everything is back to normal.

123
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
 Really interesting story.

124
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,760
 And I'll put it in the show notes, of course.

125
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,120
 But now we have a tragic update.

126
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,300
 This is so weird.

127
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 This is so weird.

128
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,720
 I was reading my true crime.

129
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,280
 I wake up every morning and reading all these true crime websites.

130
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,040
 Let's take a look at this.

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,520
 December 13th, 2022.

132
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's 4pm in the afternoon.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,560
 A man named Andrew Nguyen Done, 36 years old.

134
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,720
 He was a former student of UC Irvine.

135
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,240
 Back in 2017 to 2019, he attended this campus.

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,520
 He shows up at the social sciences plaza.

137
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,160
 We've seen this story happen before, right?

138
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,840
 Like sometimes people have no relation to the school.

139
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
 Sometimes they're current students.

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,920
 Sometimes they're former students.

141
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,360
 Andrew shows up at the social sciences plaza.

142
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:13,600
 And he brings along his 77 year old mother, Tao Tai Nguyen.

143
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,840
 They both proceed to go to the top floor of one of these social sciences buildings.

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,680
 Once they're at the top floor, out on one of these exterior staircases, Andrew throws

145
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 his mother off the building.

146
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,080
 He then jumps off himself.

147
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,920
 They both die.

148
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,480
 This is the first murder that has happened at the social sciences plaza.

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,400
 They have all been suicides.

150
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
 But just what was this?

151
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,040
 Two weeks ago, as of recording this episode, a dude threw his mom off and then jumped off

152
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
 himself.

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
 You have so many questions.

154
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,640
 This was a brief article on a true crime website.

155
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'm sure UC Irvine, they know what to do.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,200
 They just get the bodies out, go on with the day.

157
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
 This is 4pm, right?

158
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,840
 This was right in school hours.

159
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,160
 Throws a 77 year old mother off the ledge and then jumps off himself.

160
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,640
 It's absolutely insane.

161
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,720
 And speaking of that, Andrew did suffer from mental health issues.

162
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,480
 He was put in a mental hospital at one point and he sexually assaulted his roommate while

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
 they were in the mental hospital.

164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,160
 I mean, I feel bad for that dude, right?

165
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,760
 You're already in there.

166
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,320
 You're suffering from some mental issues.

167
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
 And then you make some big ol' pervo and you can't leave.

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 You can't leave.

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,760
 But Andrew sexually assaulted his roommate so then they took Andrew out of the mental

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,440
 hospital, put him in a jail.

171
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,400
 He was there for about half a year and then he got three years probation.

172
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,040
 He just got off probation in July and now he's dead.

173
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 Along with his mother.

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
 He murdered his mother.

175
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 This is so weird.

176
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,000
 We don't know why.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 We don't know how.

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
 I mean, I guess he picked her up and threw her over.

179
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,240
 Like, did they take the stairs?

180
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 77 years old.

181
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,640
 That's a lot of stairs.

182
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,320
 That's a lot of stairs to walk up.

183
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
 Did they take the elevator?

184
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 Did she know?

185
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
 You're gonna chase those such minor points.

186
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,320
 You're like, did her legs cramp?

187
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,560
 Did she know?

188
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,240
 He was going to throw her off.

189
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,760
 Was it an assisted suicide and then a suicide?

190
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,200
 Like was she like, I can't take this anymore, Andrew.

191
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,680
 Take me to those stairs you've always been talking about.

192
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,240
 Absolutely creepy.

193
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,720
 And again, knowing what you see Irvine has done with so many of the suicides that have

194
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,080
 taken place there, they just brushed it off.

195
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,760
 I imagine this is also just going to get brushed off.

196
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
 A murder.

197
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,480
 A murder took place at the suicide machine.

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,560
 That's a whole new wrinkle to what craziness could be going on here.

199
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,080
 An old student.

200
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,920
 He hasn't been there for three years.

201
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,120
 He hasn't been a student for three years while he was in a mental hospital in jail.

202
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
 Why did he come back here out of all the places and you see Irvine?

203
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
 Why did he come here?

204
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 Why did he bring his mom?

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,480
 Did his mom know what was going to happen?

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 Who knows?

207
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,840
 A terrifying story nonetheless.

208
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,560
 Rex Ivan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're going to leave

209
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,680
 behind you see Irvine.

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,760
 Give us all the way out to Minneapolis.

211
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,400
 First off I want to give a shout out to Patreon supporter and active member of the Patreon

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,600
 Discord at Denby Jones.

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,520
 He's the one who sent me over this story.

214
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,640
 He goes, "Listen, I don't know if this is true.

215
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,720
 I found this online, but it's interesting.

216
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,680
 I actually do think it's true.

217
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
 I actually, it's definitely possible.

218
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,600
 It's 100% possible."

219
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,920
 On December 12th, 2022, a former police officer posted something online saying, "This happened

220
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
 a long time ago.

221
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,800
 It happened in Minneapolis.

222
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,040
 Maybe I could get in trouble for posting this, but whatever.

223
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
 It's been a while.

224
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,240
 I don't really care anymore."

225
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,400
 There was a string of murders in the city of Minneapolis a while back.

226
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,280
 They were all related.

227
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,680
 They were all related because we knew the victims all had something in common and the

228
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,280
 gunman used the same M.O.

229
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,960
 He actually might have been a professional hitman the way all of these things played

230
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,440
 out.

231
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,440
 The police officers in Minneapolis, they started to get these calls of these shotgun

232
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,120
 murders all over town.

233
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
 The police will show up.

234
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,600
 The front door is open.

235
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,680
 There's a man laying there with two shotgun blasts to the chest.

236
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,360
 No shotgun shells at the scene.

237
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,600
 Which is very important.

238
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,720
 So when you are shooting someone with a gun, say a rifle or a handgun, as the bullet, and

239
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,240
 I know there's probably the wrong terminology that I'm calling what comes out of the gun.

240
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,400
 I always get yelled at about this stuff.

241
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:37,400
 When you fire a bullet out of a gun, it will...there's always, no matter how you make the guns, you

242
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,080
 can actually sand down this part of it, sand down this part of the barrel, but the rifling

243
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,280
 in the barrel of the gun will actually leave groove marks on the bullet as it's spinning

244
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,240
 through to come out and go into somebody else's body.

245
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
 So that's why they're constantly doing these ballistic matches.

246
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,160
 It's so unique to a gun that if I find a bullet, as long as it's in reasonable shape, if it's

247
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,000
 completely flattened, I think you'd have a harder time doing the rifling.

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,240
 I don't think you'd get it all if it's mushroomed out like a hollow point.

249
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 I could be wrong on that.

250
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,000
 But you have the bullet.

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,040
 You can match it to the rifling of a specific gun or rifle.

252
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,400
 So if I have a bullet and it has the grooves in it, I can then, if I can get the suspect's

253
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,080
 weapon, you guys are like, "I didn't do it.

254
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 I didn't do it."

255
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 And they're like, "Well, do you own a .22?"

256
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
 Yeah.

257
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,080
 And I'm able to match the rifling of the bullet to that .22.

258
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,600
 It's the same thing as DNA or fingerprints for a firearm.

259
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,120
 Now when you're shooting someone with a gun, you can't then take the time to pull the bullets

260
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
 out of them.

261
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,680
 I mean, I guess you could if you're in the middle of the woods.

262
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,840
 It's a totally isolated location.

263
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,360
 But when you shoot someone with a gun, generally you're going to leave the area.

264
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,200
 And if I can pull those bullets out and they're in good enough shape that I can test those

265
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,480
 grooves, I will get your gun in.

266
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,200
 And I will shoot bullets out of your gun.

267
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,440
 And then I will match the grooves in that bullet to the bullet that's in the body.

268
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,600
 That's how they'll catch a lot of people.

269
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,560
 Shotguns do not do this.

270
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,000
 The way a shotgun shell works is that when that shell is, once the gunpowder in the

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,440
 shell is ignited, a bunch of shots, small little ball bearings, basically, BBs, I know

272
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,240
 a bunch of gun, I know a bunch of gun aficionados are pulling their hair right now.

273
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,800
 They're getting their guns ready to kill me.

274
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,480
 When you fire a shotgun, all the shot comes out of the shell and there's no rifling.

275
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
 So you can take all the BBs in the world, you'll never be able to match them to what

276
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
 shotgun it came out of.

277
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
 However, the shells themselves, when that hammer comes down and clicks the back of the

278
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,120
 shell to ignite the gunpowder for the shot to come out, the hammer on the shotgun is

279
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,680
 unique and it can actually leave a fairly unique impression on the back of the shells.

280
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,800
 When you eject the shells out of the shotgun, if a police officer can get one of those shells

281
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,240
 and then eventually they're able to find the shotgun, they can match the hammer imprint

282
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,560
 on the back of the shell to the shotgun it's fired from.

283
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:21,880
 If they do not have the shells outside of you carrying around a smoking shotgun from

284
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 the crime scene, they can never prove that that guy was killed with your shotgun.

285
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,200
 Obviously they can, if you have boxes of ammo of the same type of ammo that killed the guy,

286
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,600
 they'll use that in court.

287
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,560
 The fact that you had a shotgun, this person that you kept threatening with a shotgun your

288
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,880
 entire life, they got finally killed by a shotgun, they'll use that.

289
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,600
 But otherwise, like a professional hitman who's killing people at random or seemingly

290
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,920
 at random, they can't prove that's where it came from.

291
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,560
 That's a little bit of gun 101 for you from me.

292
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,600
 If you do not take this advice, you're like putting the gun down, you're like, "Oh, because

293
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,320
 I want to use shotgun for work tonight."

294
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,760
 But what happens is they're going to these houses, they're finding these people, shotgun

295
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,480
 to death, just two shots.

296
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,800
 It's a sawed off shotgun, boom, boom.

297
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,000
 The shells don't pop out, you keep it in there, you're not reloading, you turn around, you

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,160
 leave.

299
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,160
 The only evidence is there's a dead body full of shots.

300
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,000
 I've got all these pellets inside of them.

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,040
 When you're investigating a random murder, like they're really any murder, the first

302
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,120
 thing you have to do is find out, is the first thing you've got to do is find out if the

303
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,280
 murderer is still here, am I going to get killed too?

304
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,720
 But once you realize that the murderer is not there, that you're not trapped in a jigsaw

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,000
 movie, you go, "Who's the victim?"

306
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,480
 They find this guy, he's got two shotgun blasts to the chest, right inside of his house, middle

307
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,280
 of day.

308
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
 Child molester.

309
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,240
 Convicted child molester.

310
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,160
 Maybe child porn, maybe enticement of a child.

311
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,320
 I mean, you have all these other wiggle words for it or the other crimes for it.

312
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,360
 What you have is a pervert who has been found guilty by the judicial system and has now

313
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,440
 been released, but they're still on the database.

314
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,480
 In most states, I think in all states at this point, but I could be wrong, there are Megan

315
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,240
 Law type databases where you type in your zip code, and it'll give you the addresses

316
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,520
 of all of the convicted sex offenders in your area.

317
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,440
 So they go, "This guy, he's a convicted child predator of some sort."

318
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
 Child molester, child porn, whatever.

319
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
 It's usually combined.

320
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,040
 They're usually just not like, "There's no child porn for me, sir.

321
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
 I'm not a molester."

322
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,400
 I know people think that's the case, but I'm delusional.

323
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,600
 They find this guy, he's a child molester, he gets blasted away.

324
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,840
 Well a period of time passes and they get a report of another shotgun murder in Minneapolis.

325
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,120
 I doubt this is the only shotgun murders happening in the city of Minneapolis, but they go out,

326
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
 they check it out.

327
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,680
 Some guy has been shot right inside the doorway of his house.

328
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 Two shotgun blasts to the chest.

329
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,120
 Then they check the victim's background, sex offender.

330
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
 Registered sex offender.

331
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,960
 These are high level, these are level three sex offenders.

332
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,640
 All in all, 11 registered sex offenders are killed in the city of Minneapolis over a period

333
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
 of time.

334
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,240
 He goes, "We did kind of figure out his MO."

335
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,800
 Apparently, and I don't know if this is from witnesses in the area, apparently, and this

336
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,160
 story could be made up.

337
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,280
 Denby Jones is right, the story could be made up.

338
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,480
 What they had gathered in this possible fictional investigation was that he was dressing up as

339
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,560
 a delivery driver.

340
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,080
 Dressing up as like a UPS driver or an Amazon driver.

341
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,160
 Amazon driver, originally I was saying the story took place in the 80s, but if it was

342
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,320
 an Amazon driver, it would be like in the past six years even.

343
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,480
 UPS, Amazon FedEx, what have you, he would dress up as a delivery driver, he would go

344
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,840
 to the house, he would ask, "Is so-and-so here?"

345
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,240
 Because he knows the name of the sex offender and when the person said, "Yeah, that's me,"

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,400
 he would shoot them with the shotgun.

347
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,960
 Specifically, he said what we surmised is he would hold the shotgun up and that would

348
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,440
 immediately make the soon-to-be murder victim put his hands up and walk backwards.

349
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,400
 There's not much you can do when there's a shotgun pointed at you except walk backwards.

350
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,840
 And that would allow them to both slightly walk into the house where he could shoot him

351
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,600
 twice and the sound of the shotgun would be slightly muffled, the muzzle blast of the

352
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,320
 shotgun would not be super visible unless you were like looking through a window and then

353
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,040
 he would just turn around and leave.

354
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,920
 That is what they think the MO was.

355
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,640
 So why didn't we know any of this?

356
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
 Like we might not know any of it because it's fake.

357
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,600
 He is saying, and this makes sense, this does make sense, he goes, "The reason why...

358
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,560
 The police actually made an active effort to cover this up."

359
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,520
 Because it's so easy to do.

360
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,800
 He said people hate pedophiles.

361
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,240
 Like it's just one of the groups of people that everybody hates.

362
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:42,800
 And if you knew it was so easy to get away with gunning down perverts in their house

363
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,880
 that you could walk around with an untraceable weapon, the shotguns are illegal so you don't

364
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 want to be caught with one.

365
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,320
 Like if you're driving around, there's no reason, there's no logical reason why you

366
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,600
 should have a shotgun unless you wanted to conceal it and sneak up on people and blast

367
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 their brains out.

368
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 There's no one, there's no like, "I want to get this deer and I want to be right behind

369
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,320
 it when I blow its legs off."

370
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,160
 You have an untraceable weapon, a shot-off shotgun, it's super easy to conceal.

371
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,560
 You're going to houses of people who you don't have to worry about, well it's illegal to

372
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,200
 murder people, but they've already been tried and convicted.

373
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,680
 This isn't a thing, and done prison time and then was released.

374
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,080
 This isn't a thing where you're like, "Well, you know, he was 19 and she was 17 and who

375
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
 know?"

376
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 No, no, no, no, no.

377
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,000
 These are people who've had their crimes documented, they've been through the system so I'm not

378
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,760
 going to be back up here, I'm not advocating people do this.

379
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,320
 I'm saying this would be the rationale.

380
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,040
 If it got out that you could type in your zip code and find the worst of the worst, these

381
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:51,520
 will tier 3, level 3 sex offenders, go to their houses and kill them and not get caught.

382
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,960
 11 people have already been killed and the police are no closer to catching who this

383
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
 is.

384
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,600
 He goes, "It would be open season."

385
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,760
 So we covered it up.

386
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,360
 We actually, we made sure the media did not know what was going on and eventually because

387
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,040
 police beat reporters are pretty persistent, it did start to get out and reporters were

388
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,240
 going to cover it and the police had to go, "Please don't cover this because you have

389
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
 no way."

390
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,400
 If it gets out that it's this easy, the streets are going to be running red with blood.

391
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,480
 We're trying not to underplay this.

392
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,960
 You will create a massive vigilante spree.

393
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,680
 They said there was a Fox affiliate out there that they really had to put the thumb down

394
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,920
 and go, "Seriously, we had to bring them in and show them all this stuff and said this

395
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,760
 is what will happen if you report this story."

396
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,880
 It will cause so much damage.

397
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,840
 A lot of people will die.

398
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,360
 So eventually they relented.

399
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,880
 They did not cover it as well.

400
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,600
 It's a fascinating true crime story.

401
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:07,000
 If this particular series of events didn't happen, if this was just a lark, right, if

402
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,400
 this was just made up online, these do happen.

403
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,520
 And because the information is so easily accessible, I remember when Megan's law came out, I remember

404
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,800
 thinking, "It's going to be open season on these guys.

405
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,280
 All you have to do is put in a zip code and you know where everyone's at."

406
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,480
 And I'm wondering if it is open season.

407
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,440
 I'm wondering if this does happen.

408
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,040
 We see it in news articles.

409
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,440
 We see this happen from time to time.

410
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,880
 I'm wondering if it happens way more often than we think, but the police are like, "Just

411
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,200
 don't say anything."

412
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,360
 I bet it does happen a lot more than we think.

413
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,800
 Especially if you like to kill people, right?

414
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,080
 If you're a hitman, they thought this guy might be a professional hitman on the side.

415
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,560
 Maybe it's just a way for him to keep his reflexes going in between jobs.

416
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
 Who knows?

417
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,280
 Or maybe he's just trying to rid the world of super perverted people.

418
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,920
 I'm a fan of vigilance-yism.

419
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,040
 I'm not a huge fan of murdering people.

420
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
 I don't know.

421
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,480
 I don't know what else to add to the end of that.

422
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 Like I do, vigilance-yism works when the system is broken.

423
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,520
 If the system works perfectly, there are no vigilantes because people go, "Oh, the police

424
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,800
 will take care of it and the justice will be served."

425
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,520
 It's when those things don't happen.

426
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,720
 When someone commits 10 horrendous crimes and then they plea it down to one horrendous crime

427
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,280
 and instead of 25 years, they get five years and then they're out in three, the system's

428
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
 broken.

429
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,040
 And that's when you see the vigilantes show up.

430
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,560
 I am a fan of vigilance-yism.

431
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,440
 I'm not a fan of lynch mobs.

432
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,880
 And there's a fine line between those two as well.

433
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,760
 But yeah, I'm not a fan of murdering people.

434
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,640
 I guess I wish you could just beat them up and they'd learn their lesson and they would

435
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
 stop being pervos.

436
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,160
 A shotgun blast to the chest.

437
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
 I don't know.

438
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 It's a crazy story though.

439
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,720
 I'm sure it is super common, but Rex Ivan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

440
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Carbenter copter.

441
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,360
 We are leaving behind Minneapolis.

442
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,320
 We're waving goodbye to that police officer.

443
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,720
 We give a lot of details.

444
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
 I'm thinking he might have been the guy with the shotgun, honestly.

445
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,720
 But he's waving us and he's holding a shotgun behind his back.

446
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 We're like, "Okay, see you later, buddy."

447
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,400
 Rex Flyus out of Minneapolis.

448
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,600
 We are headed to Switzerland.

449
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 I've been studying conspiracy theories since I was about 12.

450
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,720
 34 years I've been in the game and one thing that I love, and I think it's what separates

451
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,400
 the successful conspiracy theories from the just the madness that some crazy guy thinks

452
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,520
 up and no one pays attention and it just disappears.

453
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
 Brevity.

454
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,360
 Keep it short.

455
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,120
 Keep it simple.

456
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,920
 The color orange is evil.

457
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,280
 It's a real conspiracy theory.

458
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,600
 It makes no sense.

459
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,600
 I've studied that one and even I am unsure how they get to the color orange is evil.

460
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,880
 I know it has something to do with the parts of the NASA spacecraft is made of orange.

461
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:41,000
 I don't know if it's related to their Tang addiction, but it doesn't make any sense.

462
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,280
 Mountains are trees.

463
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,120
 The theory is that the world used to be much bigger and when we look at a mountain we're

464
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,800
 actually looking at the stump of a tree that used to reach high into the sky.

465
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,880
 The trees we see would be bushes in the past.

466
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 Brevity.

467
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:11,120
 You could say it all in a sense and it evokes a natural world that has been lost.

468
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,400
 A world of giants.

469
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,040
 A world of nature unbridled.

470
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,840
 Trees bigger than we could even imagine.

471
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:29,680
 We're just looking at the dead remains of this once truly awe inspiring world.

472
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,640
 Brevity.

473
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,600
 Monkeys don't exist.

474
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,920
 Every monkey you've ever seen is a puppet or a man in a suit.

475
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,640
 Evolution is a lie to make us not believe in God.

476
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
 Brevity.

477
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,720
 When you come across a conspiracy theory that can just be explained so easily and just make

478
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,320
 the mind wander in wonder, that is gold.

479
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,040
 AI art.

480
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,320
 AI art is this new thing.

481
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,400
 Everyone's using it.

482
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,280
 There's a lot of debates.

483
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,520
 You have artists, traditional artists as there will now be known as who are fighting against

484
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 it.

485
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,640
 No to AI art.

486
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
 There's this huge movement no to AI art.

487
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:25,320
 To me it reminds me of when the painter saw the photographer and said that's not art.

488
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,320
 Like I'm spending hours making an impression of this mountain.

489
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,720
 You're just clicking a button.

490
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,800
 It's the same mountain sure but where's the soul?

491
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,960
 Where's the creation?

492
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,160
 Where's the interpretation of what I'm doing?

493
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,720
 Now both arts stand side by side.

494
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,440
 I think we'll see the same thing eventually with AI art.

495
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,320
 I don't think it's going to replace artists.

496
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,760
 I think it may replace some of the gig artists.

497
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,240
 People who are doing logos on Fiverr.

498
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,320
 People who are doing first sonas.

499
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,520
 That stuff will be replaced by AI art.

500
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,280
 But the artists themselves won't be replaced.

501
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,760
 They will evolve with it.

502
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,880
 I think they'll start using AI art themselves and doing touch them and everything.

503
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,280
 I don't think it's the end of art or artists or anything like that but it's fascinating

504
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,720
 to watch and it's happening so quickly.

505
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,000
 Now as a television movie buff I've been loving the things.

506
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,720
 We did a whole episode on the Chrome Lords or a whole segment on the Chrome Lords.

507
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:33,760
 This lost 1990s straight to video movie about man and machine fusing as one and a new religion

508
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,000
 being born out of it.

509
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Or actually that's not the plot.

510
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 There's no plot.

511
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,540
 It's just a series of images that look like it's from a 1990s straight to VHS sci-fi horror

512
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
 movie.

513
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,040
 It looks fascinating.

514
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,000
 Recently I saw Black Star Wars.

515
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,800
 Fascinating.

516
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,480
 It's Star Wars meets the Wiz.

517
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,800
 With an all black cast.

518
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,800
 A 1970s vibe.

519
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,640
 Very discotech.

520
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,680
 The Death Star itself a huge disco ball.

521
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,880
 Jet Eyes wearing large brimmed hats.

522
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,400
 It's fascinating stuff.

523
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
 This is all AI generated.

524
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,120
 People are typing in these prompts and they're creating these images of movies that may have

525
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,760
 been.

526
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,300
 The Russo Brothers recently profiled The Avengers directed by Wes Anderson.

527
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,760
 So it has a very the royal Tenenbaum's vibe.

528
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,160
 The costumes look handmade.

529
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,120
 They look like they're made of leather and cloth.

530
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,680
 And all these images are going to be in the show notes.

531
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,600
 You've probably seen a lot of them yourselves.

532
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,400
 And people are getting a kick out of these.

533
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,560
 It is like what if Star Wars wasn't created by George Lucas but it was created by Melvin

534
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,080
 Van Peebles.

535
00:33:50,080 --> 00:34:01,840
 But when I found this image in Afrocentric Star Wars it was accompanied by one sentence.

536
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,520
 This was a post on the export.

537
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,360
 One sentence.

538
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,640
 Probably one of the best conspiracy theories that I've come across recently.

539
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
 This is fascinating.

540
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
 I love this.

541
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,880
 I talk about brevity and yet I spent that whole time building up to this.

542
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,480
 Disco Funk Star Wars.

543
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,640
 One sentence.

544
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,440
 These are not images from AI.

545
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:31,560
 They are images from CERN.

546
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,480
 CERN needs no introduction.

547
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,080
 But I'll give a short one.

548
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,760
 Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland.

549
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,000
 It has long been associated with, even really before it turned on.

550
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Even when they were building it.

551
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,040
 It was going to create a black hole.

552
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,840
 When they activated it was going to destroy the planet.

553
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,920
 It was going to open gateways into other universes.

554
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,720
 That's the most common conspiracy theory right now.

555
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,960
 I went to a thrift store here in town.

556
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,000
 I made the mistake wearing an alien necklace.

557
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,280
 The shopkeeper kept telling me about how CERN had opened up a portal.

558
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
 You could reach in and pull stuff out.

559
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
 They're pulling stuff out.

560
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 Don't you understand?

561
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,600
 They're pulling stuff into our reality.

562
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,000
 CERN has since its inception been connected very strongly with the world of the paranormal.

563
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 The world of conspiracy theory.

564
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,720
 But it's main thing that it gets brought into in the world of conspiracy theories that it

565
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,280
 is opening portals to other worlds.

566
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,960
 And here we have it.

567
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,720
 This is so fascinating.

568
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:42,040
 The AI art you are seeing, you are actually not getting it the way they are telling us

569
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,240
 we are getting it.

570
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,000
 What we are told is you put in a string of words.

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,600
 Wes Anderson directs the Avengers courtroom scene.

572
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,280
 Captain America played by Bill Murray.

573
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,360
 Black Widow played by Anya Taylor-Joy.

574
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
 1970s.

575
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
 CP atone.

576
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,200
 You put in all this stuff and then this picture pops out.

577
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,400
 But that's not what's happening.

578
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,240
 You're putting in these prompts and the AI is not crawling across the internet using

579
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,680
 this massive database of all existing images to build its own.

580
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:22,560
 What it's doing is when you type in the string of letters it is reaching through the multiverse.

581
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,880
 Which is infinite.

582
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,800
 To find one where that happened.

583
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,520
 It is not creating an image, it is receiving an image.

584
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,920
 Is it true?

585
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
 Probably not.

586
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
 Probably not.

587
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,760
 The AI is actually probably working the way that we think it is.

588
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,840
 So let's throw on our conspiracy caps and finish this out and just imagine for a moment

589
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,680
 how this would work.

590
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,080
 Because in a multiverse it would absolutely would work like this.

591
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:14,760
 And this AI art program is actually going into these portals that have been opened up

592
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,560
 by CERN and it is exploring the multiverse one image at a time.

593
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,480
 Or in the case of the Chrome Lords, when you're putting that in you're actually pulling screen

594
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:37,800
 grabs from a reality where the movie Chrome Lords was made.

595
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
 Pulling them into us.

596
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,160
 And this would make sense that you would have, you know how you have the Kepsha things with

597
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,280
 the images where it's like find three pictures of a car.

598
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,000
 You have to click on the three pictures of the car or the Kepsha where you have to type

599
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,080
 in what those letters actually say.

600
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,920
 That is all to assist computer learning.

601
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,720
 We just think it's an annoying thing so we can post something.

602
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,600
 So all of that information is then being fed back into computers so it has a better idea

603
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,120
 to tell what a car is, what a stoplight is, what a bird looks like because now it takes

604
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,400
 all these random images and it goes well a human identified these three as birds we're

605
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,880
 going to put these in the bird part of our brain.

606
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
 That's what it is.

607
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,640
 It's to assist machine learning.

608
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,840
 But it was also a way to stop bot attacks.

609
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,200
 It was a way to stop things from getting flooded.

610
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,520
 Things from spam accounts and things like that.

611
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
 So it did us a favor.

612
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,920
 I mean, they're pretty annoying but it does make the websites we go to more manageable.

613
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,040
 It helps the website and then it helps the machine learning tools by doing that.

614
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,760
 This would, imagine if you're sitting there at CERN and you've now opened up the multiverse.

615
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,280
 You're like, dude I gotta fill up paperwork tomorrow.

616
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,560
 I don't have time to explore the infinite depths of reality.

617
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,760
 I got that human sacrifice at 6pm tonight.

618
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,160
 So you create these programs that other people do it for you.

619
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,320
 It'll be super interesting to find out what we can't do.

620
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,480
 I know there are currently limiters on it.

621
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,360
 Like they don't allow you to create illegal material.

622
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,640
 They won't let you make child porn.

623
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,880
 If you type those prompts in a guy with shotgun shows up at your house it's the terminator.

624
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,400
 They have limiters like that built on it.

625
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,280
 But I wonder if there are going to be things that we can't find.

626
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,680
 Like you type in, I want to see a picture of Heath Ledger's Joker.

627
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,360
 But in a movie directed by Stanley Kubrick.

628
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,880
 And just won't, it won't work.

629
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,760
 That image will never pop up.

630
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,680
 It will never be the same as any other image because that for whatever reason, that movie

631
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,160
 was never made throughout the multiverse.

632
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,160
 That movie just never happened.

633
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,600
 It would be, I mean I love this conspiracy theory.

634
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
 I really do.

635
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,960
 And what's funny is the reason why I think I love this conspiracy theory.

636
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,680
 And I think I can speak for a lot of people.

637
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,400
 When we look at these images of these movies that were never made, it does make you go,

638
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,280
 "Oh man that would be cool.

639
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,440
 That would be really cool."

640
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,960
 But we know Wes Anderson is never going to direct The Avengers.

641
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,840
 The Avengers need to be these one and a half to two hundred million dollar movies and they

642
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,800
 have to have all of these things in them to make them commercially viable and all these

643
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,880
 license fees and they got to sell toys and that.

644
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,240
 But when you look at these nine or ten images of Wes Anderson's The Avengers movie it makes

645
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,080
 you go, "Wow, that would have been cool."

646
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,920
 Before the hype, before the phase four, before all of this stuff, they gave it to an auteur.

647
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,040
 That's what he made.

648
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,880
 Chrome Lords is the same thing.

649
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,280
 The Disco Funk Star Wars is the same thing.

650
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,200
 When you look at those images, I was like, "Dude this would have been so awesome.

651
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
 Would it have been a success?"

652
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
 No.

653
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,960
 Would it have created this massive franchise that's spanned decades?

654
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,080
 No.

655
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,280
 But if you found that movie, if you happened to find Star Wars directed by Melvin Van

656
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:30,480
 Peoples, sitting at a blockbuster, you rented it and you watched it, it would be an underground

657
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
 cult hit.

658
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,320
 It would be so weird.

659
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
 So good.

660
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,280
 You go, "Man, I can't believe this didn't spawn a series of sequels.

661
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,480
 This movie is dope."

662
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,160
 It does evoke that reaction in us when we see these things that might have been, but

663
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
 aren't.

664
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,320
 It's just a string of AI commands put into some web browser and then these images are

665
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
 spit out.

666
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,680
 But what if it's more than that?

667
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,840
 What if when we're looking at these images, they do exist.

668
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
 They do exist.

669
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,960
 And when we look at them, there is a version of us that did watch Star Wars when they picked

670
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,440
 it up at a blockbuster video in an old beat up VHS box.

671
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,000
 You could tell the movie had been sitting on the shelf for a long time, but when you

672
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,440
 picked it up, you took it home, you discovered it.

673
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,280
 You couldn't wait to tell your friends about it.

674
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,680
 There was a version of you that did watch this Wes Anderson Avengers movie in an alternate

675
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,760
 reality where there was no giant conglomerate pumping out these movies, three a year plus

676
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,320
 two television series.

677
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,000
 You got to watch just to understand the movie.

678
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,480
 There was a version of you that watched the Chrome Lords over and over and over again.

679
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,440
 And that's why when you saw those images, you go, wow, I wish I could have seen this

680
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
 movie.

681
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:07,080
 This movie looks so cool because you did and you loved it in another reality.

682
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,280
 I love this conspiracy theory.

683
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,520
 This is really cool.

684
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,200
 And I honestly, I don't know how much traction this is going to get.

685
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,760
 It was a single sentence.

686
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,800
 It was a single sentence on the X board.

687
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,240
 And then everyone else started talking about AI art, how to use it, how to, you know, where

688
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,160
 to find the stuff and different things.

689
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,400
 It was almost like an afterthought.

690
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,460
 This theory that was put forth, but this one might get big because people are having reactions

691
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
 to this stuff.

692
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,240
 I'm having reactions to this stuff.

693
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,960
 You see these images and you go, wow, wouldn't that be cool?

694
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,920
 Because in another universe, it was cool.

695
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
 We found it.

696
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,520
 We loved these things.

697
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,720
 Each time you type in one of these prompts, you are helping CERN map out the multiverse.

698
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:09,260
 You are exploring reality after reality after reality with just a string of words.

699
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,260
 Fascinating.

700
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,860
 I love this conspiracy theory.

701
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,860
 We'll see.

702
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,220
 We'll see if it gains any traction.

703
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,660
 I really hope it does.

704
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,460
 It's absolutely awesome.

705
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,260
 It's just one sentence.

706
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,500
 It's all it took.

707
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
 These are not images from AI.

708
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,880
 They are images from CERN.

709
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,080
 They aren't just pieces of random pictures pooled together.

710
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,320
 They're a window into an alternate reality.

711
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,960
 A world that never was for us.

712
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,640
 But for another us, out there somewhere.

713
00:44:51,640 --> 00:45:15,620
 It's the only world they know.

714
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:32,820
 It's the only world they know.

715
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,400
 (upbeat music)

716
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:45,400
