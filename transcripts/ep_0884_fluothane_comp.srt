1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Today we meet a father who has put his kids to bed and is hoping to catch a few moments

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,880
 of peace before he has to crawl into bed himself.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,280
 Little does he know he's about to meet the Grim Reaper.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,080
 And then we travel to Irvine, California to meet a man who hears a knock at his front

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,720
 door.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,840
 Little does he know on the other side of that door is one of the most bizarre stories in

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
 true crime history.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:43,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,800
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
 day too.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,320
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, you guys heard the intro.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,040
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters walking into

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,520
 Dead Rabbit Command right now.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,360
 Get those hands ready to clap for Bill.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,080
 Wooo, yeah come on in Bill.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,240
 He's walking around, he's doing a little strut.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,520
 Bill, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,160
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,800
 Just help spread the word about this show.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,920
 That really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,400
 I'm seeing a lot of the podcasts that started the same year I started back in 2018, quitting.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,040
 They're just packing it up and they're shutting down the podcast and that is not a fate that

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
 I want to befall Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
 Let's help this show grow.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,880
 Spread the word and get the message out.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,320
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the place for your daily paranormal news.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,520
 Bill, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're leaving behind Dead

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,800
 Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,720
 We're driving out to Yonkers, New York.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,240
 The year is 1974, we're in Yonkers, New York and it's late at night.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,960
 This man, he's sitting at home with his family.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,240
 He doesn't give his full name, the story is by his initials, A-L.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,480
 So we're going to call him Al.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,560
 Al is just sitting at home, it's the best time, right?

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
 He's alone.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,760
 His family's there, but technically he's alone.

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,120
 His kids are asleep and his wife's in the bathroom.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,280
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, now it's Al's time to shine."

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,800
 And he just sits back in his recliner and turns the television to some Archie Bunker.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,640
 Why, I oughta?

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,480
 He's sitting back, he's watching television, he's just enjoying some time to himself and

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,680
 then all of a sudden, Al sees something out of the corner of his eye.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:35,040
 He turns and he looks and standing there in his living room is the Grim Reaper.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,960
 It's a tall black hooded figure, it's face nothing but a luminous white skull.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,640
 He's standing there holding a skype and it slowly starts to glide backwards.

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
 Odd, right?

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,680
 Which is the angel of death is in his living room and you're like, "But shouldn't you

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
 walk forward?"

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,800
 It's little details like this that really kind of sell the story.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,080
 And Al is terrified obviously, but he can't take his eyes off of this thing.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,160
 And he watches this figure glide all the way back until it gets to the bathroom door and

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,600
 then it disappears.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,680
 Al jumps up out of the chair and runs over to the bathroom door.

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
 You obviously can put two and two together.

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,480
 My wife's in the bathroom, the Grim Reaper just went into the bathroom.

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
 He begins banging on the door and he doesn't hear anything on the other side.

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,360
 He doesn't hear, "I'm pooping, Al, I'm pooping!"

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,080
 That's normally what she says the whole time she's going to the bathroom.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,680
 Al's like, "She's not saying her catchphrase, oh no!"

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,720
 He kicks down the bathroom door and there he finds his wife laying next to an empty

62
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,240
 bottle of pills.

63
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,800
 And he goes, apparently they lived next door to her sister and her sister was a nurse.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,040
 He runs next door, bangs on the door, they all come out and help him get his wife to

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
 the hospital, they're able to stabilize her and then save her life.

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,200
 This story, like I said, I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,160
 They got it from Strange Magazine, which is one of the big paranormal magazines out there,

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,440
 especially back in the early age of conspiracy paranormal thought.

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,040
 I don't know if they're still around right now.

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
 I know Mark Chorvinsky, the guy who created it, has passed away.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,840
 But Strange Magazine, this was a story that he personally wrote about at his time at Strange

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
 Magazine.

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
 It's really, really interesting.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 We've talked a lot about guardian angels as well on this show and it's kind of the

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 same thing.

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,040
 Why do some people have guardian angels and some people don't?

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
 Or do everyone have guardian angels?

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,200
 But sometimes it's their quote unquote time to go.

79
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,400
 Why did he see the Grim Reaper?

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
 And other people have, and other people have walked in on the same situation.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,120
 They loved one taking their life and their moments too late.

82
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
 My only hypothesis is this.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,480
 He didn't see the Grim Reaper.

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,880
 He didn't see the cartoonish version of what we see as death.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,200
 The black-coated man with the skull and the sky.

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
 What Al did for whatever reason?

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
 It could have been Al alone.

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 It could have been his wife.

89
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,400
 It could have been the connection they have.

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,480
 Al sensed something was wrong.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,400
 Al knew something had happened, but he didn't know how to express it.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,480
 He got that funny feeling we sometimes get when people we love are in trouble.

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,800
 And he created almost a tulpa of what would actually get him up out of the chair.

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,520
 His brain got a signal that something was wrong and to decipher that signal it created

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,280
 the most known representation of death.

96
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,800
 But that still doesn't answer the question why Al?

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
 Why Al was able to save his wife?

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
 Was it the connection that they had?

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,720
 I imagine the connection between a mother and her children is just as strong if not

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
 stronger between a married couple.

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
 Right?

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
 Why Al?

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,920
 It's interesting and I think this is part of where the scientific community fails us

104
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,160
 as paranormal researchers is we should know that.

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,320
 We should investigate that.

106
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,480
 We should find out why.

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,000
 Because as much as I love paranormal research it definitely has its own limitations because

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,040
 paranormal researcher could read this and go "spooky."

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,920
 Or "Wow, the angel of death really appeared."

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,320
 And we kind of leave it at that.

111
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,560
 And even if we did want to study this phenomenon scientifically do we have the laboratory space?

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,760
 Do we have the techniques?

113
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,000
 Do we have the scientific rigor and the right techniques to figure it out?

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,800
 But the scientific community just dismisses all of this stuff out of hand.

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
 Right?

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,400
 They're like, "Of course, it was just lucky that the guy got up.

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
 There was no angel of death.

118
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 He didn't pick up any sort of signal from his wife.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,360
 He just got up and banged on the door and his wife was insane."

120
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
 Or catchphrase.

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,640
 So he kicked it open.

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,960
 I think there's a reason why some people see these things, these premonitions and are

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,760
 able to act on them.

124
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,520
 When most people, when they have loved ones die, I know this isn't the most cheery beginning

125
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
 of an episode, but they don't get these signals.

126
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
 Why him?

127
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,560
 I think scientifically I would like to know why, because it could actually help people.

128
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,520
 We could figure out why some people could do this if we could figure out for everyone

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,400
 to tap into these signals.

130
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,880
 But a very interesting story, one that leaves a lot of unanswered questions.

131
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,920
 On the paranormal realm it's definitely possible that the angel of death, the grim reaper,

132
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,360
 showed up to take this woman's soul because in the world of the paranormal that is something

133
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
 that can happen.

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,080
 But I think there's something deeper to this story.

135
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 I do.

136
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 And it happened back in 1974, who knows who AL was, the man who wrote about it as passed

137
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,320
 on himself, and the opportunity to research this in you further is gone.

138
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,240
 But fascinating story he did.

139
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,520
 That would be super depressing, dude, if your wife tried killing herself while you were

140
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,480
 in the next room.

141
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 That would suck.

142
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,680
 That's definitely putting a tamper on your evening, but they did save her and hopefully

143
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,840
 she realized that wasn't the right path out.

144
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
 Bill, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the corner.

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,240
 I'm so depressing, I didn't expect to get that depressing.

146
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,880
 And this next story is weird.

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,040
 I don't know if it's depressing, but it might get there.

148
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,280
 Bill, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

149
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,320
 We're leaving behind Yonkers, New York.

150
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,720
 We're headed all the way out to Irvine, California.

151
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,320
 It's the early days of the year, 2020, very, very recent story.

152
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
 And there's a 40-year-old man sitting in a police station.

153
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,240
 His name is Chang Zhang.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,280
 He's an Uber driver who won the lottery in life.

155
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
 Not the literal lottery.

156
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,120
 He married a millionaire, though.

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,680
 His wife was a millionaire and he just had to drive Uber and they can make ends meet.

158
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,200
 She would do some hobby jobs, right?

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,560
 She would sell produce at local markets and stuff like that, but really she had a bunch

160
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,600
 of money tied up in investments.

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,320
 He won the life lottery for dudes.

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 But he's at a police station at the beginning of the story.

163
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,840
 So something's went wrong.

164
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:25,400
 His wife, Amber Ayaz, 34 years old, Chang and Amber live together with Melissa Fu, their

165
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,840
 12-year-old daughter.

166
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
 So you know it's a pretty good life, right?

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
 You got your little family.

168
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,440
 You got your millions of dollars in the bank.

169
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
 You just kind of passing the time.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,400
 But obviously things have taken a turn for the worse because Chang Zhang is currently

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,840
 sitting in this police department in Irving, California.

172
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,480
 And he's been talking to the police a lot over the past couple months.

173
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,120
 And this time, the police have actually brought in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,440
 Chang is sitting there and he's getting hooked up to this polygraph machine and he's meeting

175
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
 this FBI agent who's coming in.

176
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,560
 The police officers are kind of standing around the table.

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,680
 The FBI agent sits down, a specialist in behavioral analysis.

178
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,520
 The FBI agent is sitting there looking at Chang and the FBI agent goes, "I know you've

179
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,360
 told this story several times before, but I'd like you to tell it to me."

180
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,240
 And Chang lets out a deep sigh and says, "You're not going to believe me, but this is what

181
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,360
 happened."

182
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,240
 It's November 22, 2019 and we're in the city of Irving, California.

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,840
 It's 4.30 in the afternoon.

184
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,800
 And we're at a little apartment on Michelson and University.

185
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,120
 Now Melissa was Chang's stepdaughter and she was a 12 year old girl and they all lived

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,280
 together in this beautiful neighborhood in Irvine, California.

187
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,280
 Chang was an Uber driver, Amber was a millionaire who just kind of did stuff for fun on the

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,400
 side.

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
 And Amber was out of town.

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,320
 She'd actually recently driven out to Nevada to load up her car full of produce that she

191
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,840
 was going to bring to California to sell at a local market.

192
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,680
 Chang is at home with Melissa on this afternoon when all of a sudden, it's knock on the front

193
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
 door.

194
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,680
 Chang gets up and he walks to the front door and when he opens the door he sees standing

195
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,600
 in front of him a man and a woman he's never seen before.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,200
 Now that's not unusual, right?

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,000
 The strangers are allowed to come to your door, maybe they're salespeople, maybe they're

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
 religious ministers, maybe they're lost in need to use their phone.

199
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,760
 But before Chang can even go, "Hey, I don't know you guys."

200
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:45,880
 The woman reaches out towards him, sprays him with something in the face.

201
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 Chang falls to the ground and blacks out.

202
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,400
 Years later, Chang wakes up in his apartment.

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:04,040
 He looks around and the first thing he notices is the blood.

204
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,040
 The carpet is stained with blood.

205
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,080
 There's a bloody handprint in the kitchen.

206
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,640
 Melissa is gone.

207
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,160
 Chang looks at the clock and it's been hours.

208
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
 This is when he realized he's been out for hours.

209
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,480
 Never should have been home by now.

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,360
 She's not there.

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
 And as he's sitting in this empty apartment with bloodied carpet and a blood stain on

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
 the wall of a handprint, he doesn't know what to do.

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,960
 What would you do, right?

214
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,520
 Call the police?

215
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,400
 But before he can call the police, he finds a note.

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,080
 The FBI agents looking at Chang in the interrogation room and Chang's like, "I know you don't

217
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,680
 believe this story, but that's what happened.

218
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,520
 I woke up and I found this note and the FBI agent goes, "What was on the note?"

219
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,760
 And he goes, "Well, it was written in Chinese.

220
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
 It was written in Chinese, handwritten.

221
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
 And it told me that Amber and Melissa were going to be gone for a few days and they would

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
 come back.

223
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,920
 But only, only if I didn't call the police.

224
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
 It said if you call the police, you will never see them again."

225
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
 And Chang goes, "And the note told me to clean up the crime scene.

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,320
 I know basically what I did makes me look like the perpetrator, but the note told me

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
 to.

228
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,480
 The note told me to get rid of all the evidence, but I didn't do it."

229
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,600
 I can tell you, see that look on your face right now, FBI man?

230
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,680
 I didn't do it.

231
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,120
 Over the next week, Chang followed the instructions.

232
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,560
 It said, "Just clean up all the evidence and don't let anyone know what's going on and

233
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
 Amber and Melissa will come back home."

234
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,440
 So he cut out the bloody piece of carpet, threw it away, replaced it, painted over the

235
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,720
 bloody handprint, went to his daughter's school and said, "Oh yeah, you know, sorry,

236
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
 Melissa's really sick.

237
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,120
 She can't come to school this week."

238
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,800
 Just as his wife on WeChat, WeChat is basically the Chinese equivalent of Facebook, was messaging

239
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,760
 family members under her account acting like she was still in the house.

240
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,480
 He even found his wife's Ford Explorer that she had driven out with all of the--to go

241
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,360
 get the produce in Nevada.

242
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,640
 He found that.

243
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,960
 The article said he found it in her normal spot, so I don't know where that was, but

244
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,600
 he was able to track down her car, drove it away, and then took the produce to the local

245
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,040
 market and sold the produce.

246
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,560
 He basically acted as his wife for a week.

247
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,080
 He keeps getting notes slid under his door saying, "You're doing great, Chang.

248
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,120
 You are doing great and you sold those apples for a profit.

249
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,840
 Keep doing what you're doing and they will return to you."

250
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,200
 But it's been more than a week at this point.

251
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,880
 He's starting to get nervous, but he keeps getting his notes saying they're just going

252
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,960
 to be gone for a little bit longer.

253
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,240
 Keep doing all of these things.

254
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
 They'll be home soon enough.

255
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,800
 Then eventually he gets a note saying, "Okay, so you need to leave town for two days."

256
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,960
 He drives to Vegas.

257
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,560
 He has a relative in Vegas, hangs out there.

258
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 He's playing with all the produce money.

259
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,720
 He's like, "I'm a millionaire myself now."

260
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,940
 He's in Vegas for two days.

261
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,040
 He comes back.

262
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,880
 There's a final note waiting for him.

263
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:42,040
 It says, "Clean the apartment again and they will be home in a few days."

264
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,320
 Now Melissa and Amber went missing on November 22nd.

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,760
 It's December 2nd by now.

266
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,720
 And Chang is sitting in his apartment and he's like, "This is not working out.

267
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,560
 I don't know what is going on."

268
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,320
 But Melissa and Amber aren't back.

269
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
 You have to thank Chang's thinking this whole time.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,360
 No one's going to believe this.

271
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
 Nobody's going to believe this story.

272
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,600
 I just suppose if a bunch of evidence my family went missing.

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
 But I'm innocent.

274
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,400
 The cops have to believe me.

275
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,360
 I'm totally innocent.

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,640
 So Chang eventually goes to the police and says, "Guys, you're not going to believe this

277
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,320
 story, but my wife and my daughter have gone missing and I cleaned up all the evidence because

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
 I kept getting these notes."

279
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,920
 And you can just imagine the police officers when he's telling this story, they're like,

280
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 "Dude, what in the world?

281
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
 This is going to be a slam dunk case.

282
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,240
 This guy obviously did it."

283
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
 But he does report his family missing.

284
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,200
 And the police are like, "Okay, well let's interrogate you for a while.

285
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,320
 Let's see if we can make this guy crack."

286
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,200
 40 hours of interviews with Chang stuck to a story the entire time.

287
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,000
 Police officers are like, "This dude totally did this."

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,240
 He got rid of all the evidence.

289
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,120
 He poses his wife on WeChat.

290
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,680
 He's talking to people, trying to buy time.

291
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,760
 This is killer 101 type stuff.

292
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,120
 They put him under surveillance.

293
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
 They go, "This is their theory.

294
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,880
 This is what they're thinking."

295
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
 He's having an affair.

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
 His wife has millions of dollars.

297
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
 He's going to kill her.

298
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,480
 Life insurance, kill her, will, whatever.

299
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
 You must be having an affair with something, right?

300
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,680
 So they put this dude under surveillance.

301
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,200
 24 hour around the clock surveillance for 44 days.

302
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,920
 And the police officers who, they had the police officers like physically investigating

303
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
 him.

304
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,640
 Like police officers going through all the forensic stuff.

305
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,680
 You have everyone trying to figure this out.

306
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 But the police officers who are on the stakeout, who are following this guy around, about maybe

307
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,640
 two weeks into the stakeout they're like, "This dude might be innocent."

308
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,280
 Because this dude is so boring.

309
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,480
 This dude, he sits at home all day long.

310
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,360
 And occasionally he gets out and walks around the neighborhood and goes, "It sits at home."

311
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,840
 He's not calling up a mistress.

312
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,040
 He's not meeting anyone.

313
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,360
 He doesn't have any gambling debts.

314
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 Nothing.

315
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,320
 For 44 days they kept this dude under surveillance.

316
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,200
 And eventually the captain's like, "Okay, you guys are getting paid a lot of money to

317
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,840
 watch a dude sit in his house and watch game shows."

318
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
 This isn't working.

319
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,080
 If he did this, because now it's, people are starting to doubt that Chang did this.

320
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,440
 And Chang goes, "Listen, yes, I did cut out the bloody piece of carpet and I did paint

321
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,480
 over the handprint, but this is where I threw away the bloody carpet.

322
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,080
 Like I threw it away on this date and this garbage can so they're able to track it down.

323
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,440
 I think by the time they got it, you know, obviously there's a bunch of banana peels

324
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
 on it."

325
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 And he showed them in the kitchen.

326
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
 He goes, "Right here.

327
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
 This is where I painted over the bloody handprint."

328
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,480
 And the cops are like, "If he hadn't shown them that they wouldn't have known there was

329
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,360
 a bloody handprint under there."

330
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,440
 The cops are starting to think this guy might be innocent.

331
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,000
 That's impossible.

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 That's impossible.

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
 So they bring in the FBI.

334
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,000
 Let's bring in one of those FBI analysts we always see on those cool television shows.

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So they do.

336
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,240
 They bring in an FBI analyst and this person is talking to Chang and Chang's like, "Listen,

337
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,880
 I didn't do it.

338
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,600
 I know it sounds absolutely insane, but I didn't do it."

339
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,040
 And the FBI officer who's hearing this story is listening to Chang tell this for like the

340
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,720
 hundredth time and taking notes and stuff like that.

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,600
 And then when the FBI and the police are talking later that day after the FBI interview and

342
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:33,120
 the FBI agent who specializes in catching people lying, the FBI agent tells the police,

343
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:43,000
 "Listen, either this guy is the best actor in the world," or he's telling the truth.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,040
 Like, "I've interviewed this guy for a while now.

345
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,280
 He is not cracking.

346
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,080
 He is told, I read your reports.

347
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,200
 He has told me the exact same story he told you guys."

348
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,240
 He might be telling the truth.

349
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,560
 And the police are like, "Well, let's go."

350
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,360
 But really the biggest twist to this whole story is how it starts.

351
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,640
 The police go, "You're telling me that someone could knock on your door, spray you with mist,

352
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,840
 and then you pass out, you conveniently pass out for a couple hours and you wake up and

353
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,080
 your family's gone?"

354
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 Like that, even if everything else in the story is true, the beginning's fake.

355
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,400
 It has to be fake.

356
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
 It's impossible.

357
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,640
 And the FBI agent goes, "That's actually the most believable part of the story.

358
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,120
 That's flow of thing."

359
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
 The cops are like, "What in the world?

360
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,880
 What in the world is flow of thing?"

361
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,800
 The FBI agent says there is a chemical agent called flow of thing that if you spray it

362
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,120
 on someone, they immediately pass out for a couple hours.

363
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,600
 That's 100% totally true.

364
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,640
 And the FBI agent says, "That detail shows that whoever pulled off this kidnapping, it's

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,200
 a very sophisticated kidnapping ring."

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,480
 So the detail that is the most sci-fi-ish was actually the one that was the most believable.

367
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
 The one that was the most believable.

368
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
 The one that was the most believable.

369
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 The one that was the most believable.

370
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
 The one that was the most believable.

371
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
 The one that was the most believable.

372
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
 The one that was the most believable.

373
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
 The one that was the most believable.

374
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
 The one that was the most believable.

375
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 The one that was the most believable.

376
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
 The one that was the most believable.

377
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 The one that was the most believable.

378
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
 The one that was the most believable.

379
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
 The one that was the most believable.

380
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
 The one that was the most believable.

381
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
 The one that was the most believable.

382
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
 The one that was the most believable.

383
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 The one that was the most believable.

384
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 The one that was the most believable.

385
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 The one that was the most believable.

386
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 The one that was the most believable.

387
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 The one that was the most believable.

388
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
 The one that was the most believable.

389
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
 The one that was the most believable.

390
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 The one that was the most believable.

391
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
 The one that was the most believable.

392
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
 The one that was the most believable.

393
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 The one that was the most believable.

394
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
 The one that was the most believable.

395
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 The one that was the most believable.

396
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
 The one that was the most believable.

397
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
 The one that was the most believable.

398
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
 The one that was the most believable.

399
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
 The one that was the most believable.

400
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
 The one that was the most believable.

401
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
 The one that was the most believable.

402
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
 The one that was the most believable.

403
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
 The one that was the most believable.

404
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
 The one that was the most believable.

405
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
 The one that was the most believable.

406
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
 The one that was the most believable.

407
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 The one that was the most believable.

408
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 The one that was the most believable.

409
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
 The one that was the most believable.

410
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 The one that was the most believable.

411
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 The one that was the most believable.

412
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 The one that was the most believable.

413
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 The one that was the most believable.

414
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 The one that was the most believable.

415
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
 The one that was the most believable.

416
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
 The one that was the most believable.

417
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 The one that was the most believable.

418
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
 The one that was the most believable.

419
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 The one that was the most believable.

420
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 The one that was the most believable.

421
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
 The one that was the most believable.

422
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
 The one that was the most believable.

423
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
 The one that was the most believable.

424
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
 The one that was the most believable.

425
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 The one that was the most believable.

426
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 The one that was the most believable.

427
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
 They have no idea who took Amber and Melissa.

428
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 They were never seen again.

429
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 Now you would think, listen, Amber and Chang are both citizens of China.

430
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 They have deep family roots in China.

431
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,480
 So first they thought maybe Amber took Melissa, took the daughter, and went to China.

432
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
 Or even just disappeared somewhere within the United States.

433
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 But none of her accounts have been touched since that day.

434
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,480
 Melissa used to call her grandma like once or twice a week.

435
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,480
 Grandma has not heard from Melissa since that day.

436
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 November 22nd, 2019.

437
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 No bank accounts or no contact has ever been done.

438
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,480
 So you think even if they did go to China, she would still be accessing her cash.

439
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
 She's not.

440
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
 No one is.

441
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
 The money is just sitting there.

442
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,480
 And then when the police were investigating all this and Chang was like, I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

443
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
 The police go, well, we have something to actually tell you, Chang.

444
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 Your wife wasn't a millionaire.

445
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 He's like, what?

446
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
 Yeah, she is.

447
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
 She's a millionaire.

448
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 She has all this money investments and the police go, no, we have to investigate that stuff too.

449
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
 Because we're checking to see if her accounts are being used.

450
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,480
 There's barely any money in them.

451
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 She's lying.

452
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 Didn't you think it was a little weird that a millionaire was driving to Nevada to buy produce to sell the local market?

453
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 She made it up.

454
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 So what police suspect is that Amber and the daughter were kidnapped for one of two reasons.

455
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:44,480
 One, because she told everyone she had a ton of money, that she was kidnapped and the goal was for a ransom to be paid.

456
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,480
 But if there's no money to pay the ransom, then it's all just for nothing.

457
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 Amber and Melissa were kidnapped to ask for ransom, but she wasn't a millionaire.

458
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 She was running some sort of Ponzi scheme.

459
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 She was running some sort of scam.

460
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
 Right, because she put on airs like she had a lot of money.

461
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
 She's selling produce to the local market.

462
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
 So they said she might have scammed someone.

463
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 She might have told someone that she had a bunch of money and they would invest in something and then she took that money and they didn't like that and came after her.

464
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,480
 It could have been that she swindled somebody.

465
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
 Who knows?

466
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 But with the FBI agent saying with the flow of thing is real.

467
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 They go, this was a sophisticated kidnapping operation.

468
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 This was not some dudes just being like, hey, that looks like a rich lady. Let's carjacker.

469
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,480
 This was planned.

470
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
 But who knows?

471
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:46,480
 To this day, for the past, what, three years now, no one has heard or seen Amber and Melissa.

472
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
 Where are they now?

473
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,480
 Are they still alive?

474
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 What struggle happened in that house that left the blood there?

475
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
 Whose blood was it?

476
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
 Did Melissa fight back?

477
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,480
 Did this 12 year old girl fight back against this adult male and female duo?

478
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,480
 She drew blood before they dragged her out of the house?

479
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 Or was it Melissa's blood?

480
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,480
 What type of confrontation would have taken place for her to bleed out?

481
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,480
 Who left the bloody handprint?

482
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 When did they take Amber? How did they take Amber?

483
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,480
 Her car was parked in the normal location that it's parked.

484
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
 Not in the driveway. It was kind of vague about that.

485
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 But was she getting out of her car when she got sprayed in the face with a mist?

486
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
 And fell asleep instantly?

487
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,480
 Only to wake up in a strange location in the dark.

488
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
 Terrifying story.

489
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,480
 You do want to think that if the time ever comes for someone to come after you,

490
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 you'll at least be able to fight, even if they have a knife, even if they have a gun.

491
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,480
 You can go down swinging.

492
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 And even the police officers thought that was the case.

493
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 That there's no way you could ever answer the door and then be rendered unconscious instantly.

494
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,480
 But apparently there is a drug out there that will do that.

495
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 That's terrifying.

496
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,480
 People coming into your house and you fighting back against them, even if you lose, even if you die,

497
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 you stood there and fought them.

498
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 But to thank the next time there's a knock at your door, you could open it up.

499
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,480
 And the next thing you know, you're packed in a trunk of a car, headed towards your oblivion.

500
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,480
 The story of Chang, Melissa and Amber, isn't just an interesting true crime tale.

501
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 It's a constant reminder that not only do we need to be, not only do we have to be afraid of the boogeymen we know,

503
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,480
 Who would have thought this even existed?

504
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,480
 But it does.

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 How many victims have fallen prey to this mist?

506
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480

507
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,480
