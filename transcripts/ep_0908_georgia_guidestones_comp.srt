00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Breaking conspiracy theory news, this might be the biggest event in conspiracy theory since 9/11.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And I don't think that's an overstatement either, this is huge.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Somebody blew up the Georgia Guidestones today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [music]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode, a special episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm actually on my vacation.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm cutting my vacation a couple days short because this is such big conspiracy theory news that I couldn't wait to talk about it.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm super excited about it. I'm not like, "Yes, property damage!"

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 But this is huge in the world of conspiracy theory, so I could not wait until Monday to talk about this.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 This is so big, so we're gonna start season 18 nice and early.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 But because we're kind of doing this off the cuff, I don't have any of the conventions anyone to give the shout-outs to.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 So everyone hop on board the Carpenter copter, we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We're headed all the way out to Georgia, of course.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 [imitates carpenter's carpenter]

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 This story is huge. I gotta admit, when I first saw it pop up, I wouldn't say I was in shock.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Like, I first saw it pop up in the High Strangeness thread on Reddit really early this morning.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'm recording this on July 6th, so really the morning after.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And it was weird because I saw it and I knew what it meant, but I almost couldn't comprehend how big this is in the conspiracy theory sphere.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 This is so huge, but let me give you a real quick background.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Some of you guys may be like, actually, I assume most of you guys know what the Georgia Guidestones are, because you guys are a well-informed group.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But a really quick overview, they were placed in the 1980s.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 There's this, basically, it's this stone structure. It's been called America's Stonehenge.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 It was placed in 1980 in Elbert County, Georgia. I'm just starting reading the Wikipedia page to kill time.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 No, in Elbert County, Georgia, back in 1980, these giant stone slabs or granite slabs were erected.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 That's okay, right? People can do modern art, right? I'm not necessarily gonna go tip it over myself.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 But what really, the reason why this blew up in this conspiracy theory community, it's not because people don't like art,

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 or they're like, "What, America doesn't deserve its own Stonehenge?"

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 No, how this really kicked off in the conspiracy theory community is what it is, is it's a set of rules.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And we don't know who put them there. The person only identified themselves as a Robert Christian.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Robert C. Christian went to this granite company back in 1979 and said, "Hey, I want to have these giant things erected."

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And they thought he was crazy. So they said, "Oh, it's gonna cost this."

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And it was like way over the amount that it would cost to make them. And he's like, "Yeah, fine."

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Okay. So they erected this and he bought the land or released the land and you put these up.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And it's basically supposed to be this set of rules that will dictate the future.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So in a sense, the Georgia guide stones, some of the rules are kind of nice.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 But the reason why the conspiracy theory community really latched onto these, and I'm not saying it was necessarily a bad thing

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 for them to always be looking at who did this because there's been no record of who this Robert C. Christian guy is.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 They've never ever been able to find out who he was. That's supposedly a fake name, but...

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And I know I'm kind of rambly. I don't have my normal notes.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Like, again, I'm kind of doing this episode a little more free-style.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 He put up these Georgia guide stones and let's look... I'm not going to read the whole list of rules, but there's ten of them.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And a lot of them make sense. I know I've said it a bunch of my listeners are grabbing ropes and pitchforks that can kill me.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Hold on, before you kill me, some of these rules do make sense.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And they're written in multiple languages. And the idea was is that if there was some sort of huge calamity, like a nuclear war,

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 that's what they were kind of thinking. These things would outlast nuclear bomb, but obviously they've been destroyed.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 We'll get to that in a second. But let's look over these rules and why someone might want to destroy them.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Let's start with rule number three. Unite humanity with a living new language.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I don't think most people would have a problem with that one.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 My favorite two are five and six. If I had to pick my top ten Georgia guide stones in this order.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And I know you guys probably just want me to get to the explosion, but let me...

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Because I feel like I do need to clarify some stuff here.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Rule number five is protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And no one's like, "What? No, I want my courts to be rigged."

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And number six, let all nations rule internally, resolving external disputes in a world court.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Wouldn't that be great, right? You have two nations that wanted to go to war, China and India are constantly beefing over that border.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They take it to the world court. But what you do in your own country, that's up to you.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I think those are reasonable rules.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Number seven, avoid petty laws and useless officials. Who would disagree with that?

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Even the most ardent, die-hard conspiracy theorist wouldn't be like, "What? No, make all the petty laws you want."

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 The reason why these have garnered so much hatred is rules number one and two.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And really rule number one.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 This is written on these Georgia guide stones and it's written in several languages, English, Spanish, Wahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, traditional Chinese and Russian.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Rule number one, maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So rule number one has always been considered to be the end goal of the New World Order, the end goal of the Illuminati.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 If you're not up on your current Earth demographics, 7 billion people and counting right now.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So to get to 500 million would be a mass calling of humanity.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Only a psychopath, I feel, right? Only a psychopath would be for the killing, the wanton killing of 6.5 billion people.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Now, I would say after a nuclear war, right, there's going to be a bunch of people around, right?

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 So if these were a built thing and there was going to be a nuclear war, they're like, "Well, we didn't have to do any killing ourselves."

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But let's say there's a horrible nuclear war and then the cavemen, they turn into like mutants.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And then a couple people who could afford bomb shelters, they were fine.

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 After the mutants get done killing all the people in the bomb shelters, the mutants would then learn to read the guide stones and go,

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have more than 500 million freakish mutants roving across the radioactive wasteland."

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But this was always been considered the Illuminati saying the quiet part out loud was these Georgia guide stones.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Number two people have a problem with this as well, because it says, "Guide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity."

76
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And a lot of people have seen that as eugenics, right?

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Like what happens if babies run right out of the room and the baby's not fast enough?

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We take it out of the gene pool, like people saw not only is it cutting down the human population of 500 million,

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 its eugenics in its purest form only the strong survive.

80
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 But you know, like the rest of them are pretty good, none of those two absolutely horrid ones.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Number nine, "Price, truth, beauty, love, seeking harmony with the infinite."

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 That's pretty sweet.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But to get there, you have to kill billions of people.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So that's the Georgia guide stones.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So now, if you weren't familiar with them, or if it had been a long time since you read them, that's a good little overview.

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 The big news is, so again, these were erected in the 1980s, and this has been a cornerstone, no pun intended, in conspiracy theory community.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 When you talk about the Colorado airport, the Denver International Airport, you guys have all heard those conspiracy theories,

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 with the weird murals inside the airport and the demon horse outside.

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I've been to Denver International Airport a lot, and you have these giant murals and they're weird.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I don't know if the murals are still there, but for a period of time the murals were there,

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 and the murals of like a guy in a soldier suit moving his sword through like a bunch of kids.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It was really weird imagery that seemed to show strife and war and genocide,

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 and then a rebirth of this new world with less people, and a lot of people connected the Denver International Airport to the Georgia guide stones.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Again, like this was all, they were saying what they wanted to do out loud.

95
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So it was a huge fixture in the conspiracy theory world.

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 This was, growing up, I was born in 1976, right? I've been into conspiracy theories pretty much.

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I ran out of the womb to a bookstore and started reading about conspiracy theories.

98
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I've been into this stuff since the guide stones have been erected, and it's something you just came to know was there.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I mean, similar to the Bermuda Triangle. It was just part of conspiracy theory lore.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 It was so much, it was in the background. It would come up from time to time, but as time moved forward,

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 you'd hear about it less and less, because it was just this thing.

102
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 This giant monument is about 19 feet tall, and it's like these several slabs.

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Well, anyways, that's the background to the Georgia guide stones. That's how it fits into conspiracy theory lore.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Well, on July 6th, 2022, early in the morning, somebody blew it up.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And there's video footage of this. There's video footage of this. I'll put all of this stuff in the show notes.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We've been talking about it on the Patreon Discord, and I got to give a shout out to Patreon supporter.

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I'm living in your walls for being the first person to post it in there. Beat me to it.

108
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's a lot of fun on there, and we've been talking about it, and so somebody blew this.

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Well, really, they blew up one of the slabs. Remember, on each slab is like two different languages.

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There's quite a few languages on there.

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And the idea that it was going to be like this Rosetta Stone and type of thing.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So if you could translate one side of it, you could learn these other languages as well, and it could be used to translate other things.

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Saying that all of civilization is destroyed, you could use this to read these other languages.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I don't necessarily know why they included Swahili in there, but...

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And the idea is that one of these slabs was blowing up.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And again, when I saw that news, I thought, "Okay, so what could have possibly happened here?"

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They're actually not saying yet that it was an explosion.

118
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Even though I will put the video on the show notes, it clearly blew up.

119
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 You can see fragments flying everywhere.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 But the authorities at this time of me recording this have not said that it was an explosion.

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And I think what they mean by that, that they don't know if it was a bomb.

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 If somebody did it. I mean, unless the governments uncovered this new way of destroying things, Professor X was there, riveting it apart with his mind.

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 They're not saying it was an explosion, but I remember I saw the initial article and I go, I mean, again, I was almost in shock.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Because this is such a big event for the conspiracy theory community.

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's such a big event for the conspiracy theory community.

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And I feel like somebody attacked, in essence, the Illuminati's Ten Commandments.

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Now, what's it? I feel like I was actually going to record something fairly brief here, right?

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But now I feel like I have to...my personal...this is so interesting.

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I feel like I'm kind of coming off half-cocked on this thing, honestly.

130
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The idea that this is the Illuminati's Ten Commandments is the general belief in the conspiracy theory community.

131
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I...I...OK, here's my thing. Here's my thing.

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And I've talked about this several times on this show.

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I don't think there is a singular group that currently controls the world or is trying to control the world.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I've talked about it a lot.

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I think there are a lot of groups, some very powerful and some trying to weasel their way up there, that want to control the world.

136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And alliances and shifting power balances and things like that.

137
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Because if you say the Illuminati runs the whole world and it's one group, it's these 13 families that have ruled the world since time immemorial,

138
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 or since the French Revolution, whatever start point you want.

139
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 When people go, "Well, what...that doesn't really make sense."

140
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So, like, what was the point of, say, the Vietnam War?

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 If one group ran the whole thing, then why would you have this...why would you have this whole thing in Vietnam that...

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 It doesn't make sense, but if you had multiple groups vying for power, and you did have a group that was based out of France,

143
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 that was trying to keep their empire in Asia, the last Romanian piece of their empire in Asia,

144
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and then you had a group that was coming out of communist China,

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 that was now starting to flex their muscles and they have all this capital and they have all these resources and they're trying to make their moves,

146
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 or a Pan-Asian alliance all over, and you have all of these factions fighting.

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That makes sense in the world of the chaos.

148
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 That makes sense.

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 If you had one group that controlled everything, it doesn't...we would have been conquered by now.

150
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 If you had one group that controlled everything, then why haven't they pulled the trigger yet?

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Why don't we all have chips in our hands? Why aren't there 500 million of us that could have launched a nuclear war in 1982?

152
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Or 1983? Or 1984? 1985?

153
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 If there was only one group, they would have pulled the trigger.

154
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They would have pulled the trigger back in 1880, right?

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Why would they have waited this long?

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So I think there's multiple groups that are all vying for power, so I don't necessarily think that the Georgia Guidestones was THE ruling class's rules,

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 but I do believe there were SOMEBODY's rules. I do believe that there was a group, because there was like this anonymous group,

158
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 that was backing this so-called "Robert Christian." I do believe this was a group of people, who...this was their vision for the future.

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And I do think they believed that it wouldn't work unless you only had 500 million people.

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And I do think they believed that if there was an opportunity to restore humans and balance with nature, they would have taken it.

161
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But they didn't have the power to do it.

162
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So I don't think it's THE Illuminati's, but I think it is A Illuminati's.

163
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I think it is A World Power, a group behind the scenes trying to control stuff. I think it was their rules.

164
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So I do believe that. I just wanted to be clear on that.

165
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So it was somebody set this up, and somebody thought it was a great idea.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I agree with some of the points.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I should stop saying that, I should stop saying that, but...

168
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Somebody blew it up. Somebody blew it up.

169
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And when I saw that, I thought, "Whoa, that's really crazy."

170
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And then what really prompted me to say, "I have to talk about this today."

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Like, I kind of snapped out of my...

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 This is huge. It would be the equivalent of if they said, "Oh, the Bermuda Triangle got sucked away."

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Like, there's a bunch of UFOs floating around. Like, this is huge in the conspiracy theory community.

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Basically, Ewoks are dancing around, and fireworks are going off over the Moon of Indore, over this.

175
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Now, it got tore down.

176
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So only one slab blew up.

177
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And Mason, a longtime Patreon supporter, one of the mods of the Discord, said,

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 "We might..." He said this earlier. He goes, "Now we might be able to figure out who actually

179
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 "erected them in the first place." 'Cause they did this back in 1980, 1979, 1980.

180
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 They're filling out all this paperwork. Now there's been this big explosion.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And if you want to repair it, we'll know who is behind it, or we'll have more of a clue.

182
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They just tore it down. This... Today, today, like a couple hours later, they removed the entire structure.

183
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Multiple slabs, multiple tons of concrete were hauled away in the middle of the afternoon.

184
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 America's Stonehenge is no more. The Georgia Guidestones are gone.

185
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I did not predict that at all. Like, when Mason said that, I thought,

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "Oh, dude, that's a really good point, 'cause, yeah, someone... Like, is there insurance on this?"

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I mean, I'm sure if you're running the world or vying to control for running the world,

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 you're not worried about your insurance payments. Well, I did not think they would tear them down.

189
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Like, this is huge. This is huge. And I want to touch on two other things, 'cause I feel like this is really rambly.

190
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 This is entertaining. This is a weird way to start off Season 19. Maybe. Or maybe it's super entertaining.

191
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I don't know. I could honestly talk about this for hours. I never would have thought that this was even possible.

192
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 This was such a monument to this new... This elite idea. This worldview.

193
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I feel like by me saying, I don't think the singular illuminati's behind it, that I'm somehow whitewashing.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And I hope that's not the case. Like, I do think... Just to be on the record, I do think killing 6.5 billion people is bad.

195
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Whatever your reasoning for it is, it's not a good... Not a good look.

196
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 But this was not predicted anywhere. Nobody saw this coming. This is the equivalent of burning the Library of Alexandria.

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 This in... For the conspiracy theory community, I honestly can't think... The only thing that could possibly rival this is a nuke taking out Area 51.

198
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 This is huge. This is so huge for the conspiracy theory community. It was huge enough for me to interrupt my break and crawl into a sweaty closet without running my air conditioners for an hour before I normally do.

199
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I mean, this is huge. This is huge in the world of the conspiracy theory community. This would be on the level as if we found out Alex Jones got assassinated.

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 We could track it back to the CIA. Like, it's that big. I hope that I'm... I hope on one hand I'm not underselling it. I hope on one hand I'm not over-selling it.

201
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 You're like, "Jason, you've compared it to the burning of the Library of Alexandria in 9/11. You're definitely not underselling it."

202
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And I want to say to this too, I want to wrap it up because this is just the weird world that we live in. This happened on July 6, 2022.

203
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Now, that's 7/6. And I'm talking about doing that numerology nonsense. I hate that stuff. But no, this happened on July 6, 2022.

204
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 This is weird. I don't even know if this means anything. On July 5, 2022, they fired up the CERN reactor.

205
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 That big old mechanical thing that spins atoms around super fast. It's somewhere in Europe. I don't have any notes on it. I'm just going off of my head.

206
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 The CERN... I think it's the Large Hadron Collider. Little atoms are going around smashing into each other in stuff like that. It's like a Goldfinger concert at the speed of light.

207
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 They turned it on the other day. See, I was seeing... I'm on vacation, man. I'm on vacation, but I'm still reading all this stuff.

208
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And conspiracy theory communities like, "Hold on to your Bernstein Bear books."

209
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Were about to shift timelines again. Because they announced when they were going to do this. It's not like some guy walks in and flips a switch.

210
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And all of a sudden, atoms are smashing into each other. They kind of got a repair for this. They got to get all their nerd notes together.

211
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Be able to observe this. So they announced that they were going to do this on July 5 and people started freaking out.

212
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Like, they always freak out whenever they turn on this thing. They're like, "It's going to change the timeline. All this stuff's going to happen."

213
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And I'm just sitting there and I'm eating my soup and crackers. And then they turn it on. I'm sucking an infinite loop of eating soup and crackers.

214
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, good thing. I picked up some good soup." But no, the next day, or a couple hours later, really, to turn it on.

215
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You know, with the time differences in Europe, July 5 and everything like that, it's hard to really tell what, when's happening.

216
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I guess I probably could have looked up a time clock or whatever they call it. Just a normal clock, just a calendar.

217
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But anyways, I remember they turned it on and I'm reading the stuff in the conspiracy news and people were like, "What? I thought you told me that the timeline was supposed to shift, man.

218
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I didn't pay my rent. I didn't pay my rent and I quit my job because I figured I'd be in the Bernstein Bears universe.

219
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I thought I was going to become Brother Bear. But now I'm just homeless. People were mad that the timeline didn't shift.

220
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And then four to six hours later, depending on the time difference, eight hours later, whatever it is, someone blew up the Georgia Guidestones.

221
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Like the physical representation of the New World Order, or the idea of the New World Order.

222
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Obviously you have like the Bilderberg Group and the Trial and Aral Commission and Bohemian Grove and all those things, but those are like clubs.

223
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Those are places full of people. This was something you could go to visit and go like, "Discreet with the first two. That's kind of spooky."

224
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It was this physical representation. And to some people, like a conspiracy theorist as me, it was this really weird kind of creepy thing that you would say this out loud.

225
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Then you have even more hardcore conspiracy theorists who they saw it as flaunting their plan, right? They're telling us what they're going to do.

226
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They're going to kill all of us. Because none of us are going to be in the 500 million, right? None of us are going to be there.

227
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And then to people who don't care, it's just a bunch of rocks out in the middle of nowhere. This story will totally go. This story will be celebrated.

228
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 This is a huge event in the conspiracy theory community. But I don't think it'll wake anyone up to use that terminology.

229
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I don't think anyone's... I don't think this is going to be mainstream. It's just a weird quirk in the conspiracy theory world.

230
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 My question is now as, you know, I'm a conspiracy theorist. I'm also a huge fan of true crime. Who did it? How did they do it? Are they going to get caught?

231
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Should we start looking at the CERN scientists? Did this have... I mean, they said that the authorities at this time said, "We don't know if there was an explosion. There's a videotape of an explosion."

232
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Was this related to the CERN? Has the timeline shifted? Are we, for the first time in noble history, aka my life, aka the past 45 years, are we moving away from a march towards the New World Order?

233
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Or were we ever headed there in the first place? Like, was it all conspiracy theory? Was it all people putting together pieces that didn't actually exist?

234
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Was there a singular movement by a singular group where there are dozens, if not hundreds, of these groups around the world vying for control to give their version of the New World Order?

235
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And this was just one of those versions that was put out there. Did CERN shift the timeline so hard that the powers that be felt it?

236
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That this actually is the beginning of the end of the Illuminati New World Order, one world government?

237
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 This is huge. This is so huge in the world of conspiracy theory community. That this blew up and they removed it.

238
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Because even if they replace it, it was destroyed in the first place.

239
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 To a conspiracy theorist like myself, right? I'm saying there's different levels to it.

240
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 To conspiracy theorists like myself, I thought that the first two rules, I totally disagree with the first two rules, I wouldn't have blown the statue up.

241
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Since my eyeshift from side to side authorities, I was not in charge of it. I wouldn't have blown the statue up.

242
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 I think it's okay to have ideas like that out there as reprehensible as killing 6.5 billion people.

243
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I'd rather know what they plan and for them to put it up there and then we can talk about it and stuff like that.

244
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I wouldn't have blown up. But to hardcore conspiracy theorists, this is the equivalent of taking out a battleship in the Pacific during World War II.

245
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 This is a huge victory for somebody.

246
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 The unassailable got punched. They got a bloody nose.

247
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 To a lot of people, someone blew up America's Stonehenge. I didn't even know that America had a Stonehenge.

248
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But there's a core group of people that this is one of the greatest victories of their movement.

249
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 So who are these people? And how did they do it?

250
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Because again, if you take the idea that there's one world, there's one group controlling everything.

251
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 If you believe in that, the only way you can make it in Hollywood is to sell your soul to the devil.

252
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And the only way you can be a politician is to sell your soul to the devil.

253
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And this is all controlled by this demonic master who's controlling the Illuminati.

254
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He's slowly influencing us and our children through the media and through politics and all this stuff.

255
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And they're taking over the world and they're destroying it.

256
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 If you believe that the idea that one person or a small group of people could destroy a physical representation of that order is monumental.

257
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's monumental.

258
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 So I don't know where this leads. This is what's so fascinating to me. I don't know where this leads.

259
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But actually, I know that I think about it, this would actually be one of those groups that I'm talking about.

260
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I know there are, for a fact, multiple groups vying for control of the world.

261
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 But I wonder if there's anti-illuminati, and you see them on YouTube and stuff like that.

262
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You read their stuff on blogs and things like that.

263
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But I wonder if there's a hardcore militant group of people with funding, maybe even equal funding,

264
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 who dig down like the Satanic New World Order. Is this the first shot in some crazy global civil war between secret societies that we don't even know the names of?

265
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 We think we know the names of them.

266
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Was this destroyed because CERN did indeed shift us into another timeline?

267
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And it's a timeline where the Illuminati aren't in control?

268
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Did some lunatic who watched too many YouTube videos build a bomb in his garage and take it out here in the middle of the night?

269
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It was like 3-4 in the morning and blow up one of the guide stones?

270
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Or was it, for lack of a better term, an act of God?

271
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Who knows? This is huge. This is so big for the conspiracy theory community that I didn't want to wait until Monday.

272
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 But that will end the first episode of the beginning of season 19.

273
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I do have to go back on vacation and I got to get out of this hot, hot closet.
