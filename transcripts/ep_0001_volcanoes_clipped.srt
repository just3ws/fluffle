1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 A massive volcano eruption can't make that sound funny.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,680
 But anyways, the volcano is erupting in Guatemala.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,040
 Scientists discovered that animals are talking to themselves and we have yet another greatest

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,480
 horror movie ever coming out.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,160
 I'm Jason Carpenter and this is The 14th Family.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:45,080
 [Music]

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,680
 Okay, so unfortunately we have another volcano erupting right now on the planet Earth.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,080
 I think everyone's heard about the Hawaiian volcano erupting.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,720
 I don't know why I'm laughing.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,640
 This is such a tragic story.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,960
 But we're having this volcano also erupting down in South America in Guatemala, Central

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
 America.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,240
 Central America.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,920
 69 people dead as of the recording of this.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,400
 I'm looking at the DailyMail.com website about it and really the news article is mostly

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,080
 about the pyroclastic flow that erupted down the mountain.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,880
 And apparently I didn't know this.

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,520
 You see in movies it's the hot lava that's chasing people and movies like Volcano and

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
 Dante's Peak.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,920
 But the pyroclastic flow is realistically what's the most damaging.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,240
 It can move up to 60 miles an hour and it's just hot ash.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,400
 There's, go to DailyMail.com, I don't know, search pyroclastic flow, search Guatemala

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 volcano.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,320
 I'm not worried about putting links up on the website or anything like that right now.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
 But anyways, they have these just amazing heartbreaking photos of this horrible event.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,000
 People running away from, you can see the pyroclastic flow pouring off of volcano and

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,200
 just these people running from it, video of people who got trapped in it unfortunately.

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,480
 Lots of bodies, lots of funerals.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 It's tragic.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,320
 You know volcanoes are one of those things.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,080
 I would say it's probably at least the most suddenly violent thing we see on this planet.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,840
 We have earthquakes and tornadoes and hurricanes.

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
 And those are bad.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
 Like I've never been, I've been through a couple earthquakes because I'm from California.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
 I was in the 88 earthquake in Alameda.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
 So it's not like I was far away.

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
 I was right in the middle of that one.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,800
 But you know, watching the hurricanes come and they just destroy houses and tornadoes

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,160
 come and they destroy houses, that's bad.

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,960
 I'm not minimizing that at all.

41
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:01,360
 But the, just the act of the volcano of like the earth, burping up, new rock of just liquid

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,000
 earth pouring out.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,240
 And again, a lot of that's from the visuals from the movies and you see the hot bubbling

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,680
 stuff, but it just like reshapes the planet.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,080
 A tornado or hurricane will level, you know, structures, but a volcano will actually reshape

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 the earth.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
 I just think it's fascinating.

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,880
 But I think it's definitely, it's heartbreaking that these people, I mean, I'm in this nice

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,760
 little apartment here in Hood River and these people are going through some horrible tragedies

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,680
 right now.

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,160
 So despite my laughing in the beginning, a little bit of a nervous laughter, it's just

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 absolutely terrible.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,720
 I hope every, you know, hope everybody gets through this.

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,400
 If you're listening to this and you want to help, I'm sure you can find, you know, Red

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
 Cross, any place, donate your money, donate your time to help people out over there.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,280
 Because you know, obviously there's going to be a lot of reconstruction.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,040
 There's just, the photos look like they're grayscale because it's just ash everywhere.

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,400
 It's very odd.

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,840
 It is very eerie, makes it look moon-like.

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,760
 So we're going to jump to a topic that's just a little more, just what's actually much

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,960
 more cheery.

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,160
 I kind of planned it out that way.

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,560
 This is an article from BT, whatever website that is.

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,480
 It looks like it's some sort of, I don't know, television website.

65
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,040
 BT.com.

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,600
 Article is entitled.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,360
 I guess it'd be easy if I put links in here, but I'm just going to assume you know how

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
 to Google.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,760
 Articles entitled, "Animals are busy having conversations all around us," say scientists.

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,760
 Which I think it's one of those things that, on one hand, I think we kind of knew that,

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,080
 but you know that animals are talking to themselves.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,160
 What this article really goes into is that they can, scientists, or you know, the scientists

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,640
 involved in the study, are basically said that animals take turns talking, which you

74
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,960
 know, tweeting and birds tweeting and animals like chirping, of course they're communicating,

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,960
 but what they've found is that some species will actually say something and then wait

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,600
 for the other animal to respond.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,920
 So it says, I'll read a little bit of the article, "Two-way conversations, once thought

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,000
 of as a uniquely human, are common across the animal kingdom," say scientists, not all

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,480
 scientists, just some scientists.

80
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,640
 "The whistles of dolphins, low rumblings of elephants, soft chirps of naked mole rats

81
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,080
 are, and wrapping of clawed frogs might be somewhat lost in translation, but according

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,360
 to a new review of scientific evidence, they all follow the turn-taking rules of human conversation."

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,200
 And then it goes into it, it's saying that researchers from the UK and Germany have been

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,840
 looking into this for a while.

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
 It's a subject that they say really hasn't been moved forward in the past 50 years and

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
 so on and so forth.

87
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,240
 So that is interesting.

88
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,460
 So the way that separates it is that some animals will just sing a song and then other

89
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,280
 birds will be like, "Oh, I want to mate with that dude because he has a good song."

90
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,600
 Some species will actually have conversations.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:21,480
 So that implies a level of foresight.

92
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,320
 Like when you're having a conversation with someone, you have to listen and then respond

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,480
 and then at the same time expect them to what their response may be to that.

94
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,320
 It's not, we don't just say, "Food there," and then someone goes, "Food where?"

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,760
 I mean, I guess we do.

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,280
 But when we're talking to people, we have to, it's far more complex than if I was standing

97
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,640
 out on the street corner going, "Food, food's over here, food, food's over here."

98
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,000
 If, okay, so yeah, let's go with that analogy.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,560
 Imagine that I'm like a porcupine and I'm standing, what do porcupines eat, berries?

100
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,600
 Imagine I'm a porcupine and I'm standing outside of a river and I find a bunch of berries and

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,880
 I want my friends to come over and eat with me.

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,520
 I think this analogy is totally on sideways already, but I want to come over with me, but

103
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,920
 I can't really communicate.

104
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,960
 I don't have this turn taking that they're talking to scientists talking about.

105
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,040
 I can stand there and go, "Berrys, berries, berries," like I'm chirping and the other porcupines

106
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,320
 hear that I'm saying.

107
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,920
 I'm making the noise that when berries are nearby and they walk over, we eat some berries.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
 That was, okay, so that's the first part.

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,800
 But this is basically saying, which is super, that's super easy.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,320
 Ice cream truck, I hear ice cream truck.

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,120
 I know instinctually that there's ice cream nearby.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,960
 What they're saying with the turn talking thing is that a porcupine not only is going

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,240
 berries, berries, but it'll say there's...

114
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,640
 There's berries over here, guys, and then the other people walk over and go, "Where are

115
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 the berries at?"

116
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
 And then he goes, "Well, they're right over here.

117
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,840
 They're super tasty."

118
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,960
 And then the other guy goes, "Okay, maybe I'm reading a little too into this article."

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,960
 The point is, is that if animals are actually taking turns talking, that...

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,280
 I'm gonna go back to my original point, that I think that leads to a level of awareness

121
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,720
 of consciousness, maybe not consciousness, but at least awareness of, you know, having

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,880
 to be a little bit smarter than we've given them credit for.

123
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:43,360
 Let's see if I'm getting anything that I said, anything that I just went off of.

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,840
 Let me see if it's backed up.

125
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,540
 And it doesn't really...

126
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,360
 But it does say that this...

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,280
 The fact that animals do this does make more sense to why humans have developed language.

128
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,400
 So I think it means that animals are probably more aware and have more idea of what's coming

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 down the pipe.

130
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,720
 They're not necessarily instinctual animals, if they can communicate back and forth like

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 that.

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,640
 Maybe I'm reading too much anyway, but that's what I get from that article.

133
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,600
 And sometimes it's better what you get from the article than what the actual article is.

134
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,720
 Here's a interesting...

135
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,320
 This will be the last article we talk about right now, and then we'll go into the movie

136
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,400
 thing.

137
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:35,400
 So on PJ Media, I'm so lazy, I'm not even linking to stuff, but PJ Media has this article

138
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,360
 that there is this massive...

139
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,880
 Man, that is huge.

140
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,960
 The headline is "Massive cloud of flying midges descends on Cleveland, visible on weather

141
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
 radars."

142
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
 And it's huge.

143
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
 It crosses at least...

144
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,240
 Well, okay, no, it doesn't cross more than one county, but it's huge enough to show up

145
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,400
 on the radar.

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,280
 So I guess this is an annual thing.

147
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,760
 These bugs, these mosquito things come flying through, and there were so many this year that

148
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,800
 they actually showed up on the weather scanner.

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,080
 That's pretty crazy.

150
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,400
 I've never heard of a midge.

151
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,080
 It must be an east coast thing.

152
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 Cleveland?

153
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
 Which is Cleveland at?

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 East coast?

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 Whoa, there's a picture of it.

156
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,960
 Yeah, it just looks like a giant cloud.

157
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,880
 That's disgusting.

158
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
 I would live in a mosquito net.

159
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
 And nature is just amazing.

160
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,360
 And I think that's just so weird that we live in a world that can still surprise us.

161
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
 Maybe it doesn't surprise them over there.

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 Maybe they're used to it.

163
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,320
 It does seem like it's an annual thing, kind of looking at that article.

164
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
 Okay, so we have a new horror movie out.

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,080
 Once again, it's the scariest horror movie ever.

166
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,160
 It's the greatest horror movie of all time.

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,680
 That's what they said about the Babadook, which sucked.

168
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,960
 Babadook was okay.

169
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
 It follows.

170
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,520
 Oh, that's supposed to be the scariest movie.

171
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 It's supposed to be the scariest movie.

172
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
 No, it's lame.

173
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
 I don't like it follows.

174
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,640
 What was the other one that they really...

175
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
 After it follows in the Babadook, the next time they said, "Oh, this is a great horror

176
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,000
 movie," which I think might have been.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,080
 It comes at night.

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
 There might have been one in between that.

179
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
 They're like, "This is it.

180
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,800
 This is like the most artistic horror movie.

181
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
 I'm a big horror movie fan, big sci-fi fan, big genre fan."

182
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,120
 So I was totally suckered into the Babadook's trailer and got it.

183
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
 Renna did it the first day it came out.

184
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
 It was very disappointed.

185
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,320
 It was good, but the ending just completely fell apart.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 It follows.

187
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
 I fell asleep.

188
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 I thought it was boring.

189
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,280
 I thought nothing that the characters did that made sense.

190
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,480
 I think the fact that the characters just all of a sudden decided that the weakness

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
 of the "It follows" monster was electricity.

192
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,160
 So they have this big set piece where they're trying to fight it with electricity, even

193
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,400
 though nothing in the movie showed that it was weak to electricity.

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,680
 It did take a gunshot to the head.

195
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 It was just really poorly put together.

196
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,240
 I can understand why people liked it because it was very moody, but it just wasn't well

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
 put together.

198
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,760
 I didn't like the script.

199
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 I wasn't a huge fan of the mood, like the 1970s vibe.

200
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,280
 I'll go into that in another podcast.

201
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,720
 So anyways, Hereditary is the movie now that they're saying is great.

202
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 It's amazing.

203
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,400
 Hereditary, Rolling Stone calls it, "The Family Horde Tale is the scariest movie of 2018."

204
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,920
 Oh great.

205
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,160
 "Story of a family suffering from grief and something vaguely supernatural is an instant

206
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,760
 scary movie classic."

207
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,560
 Babadook was.

208
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,960
 That was the problem with the Babadook.

209
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,440
 There wasn't a spoiler alert, but the movie's like a thousand years old now.

210
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
 There was no monster.

211
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
 She was just severely depressed.

212
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 There was no Babadook.

213
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,400
 She was just super depressed.

214
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,960
 But then nothing made sense because her little boy's getting magically dragged drug upstairs

215
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,920
 and things she destroys or rebuilt.

216
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,800
 It just didn't make sense.

217
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,320
 But that was much better than it follows.

218
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,960
 So why can't I just have a horror movie with a monster?

219
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
 Oh you know what?

220
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
 Here's another.

221
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
 I'm looking at the sidebar here.

222
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,040
 It talks about that movie raw.

223
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,000
 You know, that was another movie that the critics really liked.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,360
 That movie actually wasn't that bad.

225
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 I wasn't a huge fan of it.

226
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,920
 I thought that the quote unquote "twist" at the ending was really stupid.

227
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,400
 But that movie I did enjoy the script and the acting and the plot and the tone.

228
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,960
 I thought that was very well put together.

229
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
 The last five minutes stunk.

230
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,200
 And you know, I would say that's the same thing with the Babadook.

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,840
 If the Babadook had a different ending, if it turned out that the creature was real or

232
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,440
 that it was completely in her head and none of it ever ever happened and she was like

233
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,600
 locked up in an asylum, I would buy either that second ending.

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 It's pretty stupid.

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,560
 But I would buy that rather than trying to have it both ways.

236
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
 It followed.

237
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
 I'll say this about it.

238
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
 It follows.

239
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,240
 I like the concept.

240
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,440
 I like the whole concept of it being sexually transmitted.

241
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,800
 I like the whole concept of it being this unstoppable force.

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
 It's one of those movies that when you hear the concept you're like, "Oh man, what would

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 I do?"

244
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,200
 And you kind of come up with your own scenarios.

245
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
 The execution just wasn't good.

246
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,880
 I didn't like the characters.

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,480
 I didn't like the dialogue.

248
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,920
 I didn't like the clam.

249
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
 The futuristic clam.

250
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,120
 I thought that was incredibly distracting.

251
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,880
 They kept pulling me out of the movie.

252
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 Instantly pulled me out of the movie.

253
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,880
 I'm not knocking the director.

254
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
 I'm not knocking the actors when I say the acting.

255
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
 I think the acting was fine.

256
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,960
 I just don't think the script was there.

257
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,960
 I think the big problem was that script.

258
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,240
 So the actors acted kind of like robots and that could have been a directing thing.

259
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
 It could have been a scripting.

260
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,880
 I don't know.

261
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,080
 But anyways, the idea was golden.

262
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 It follows.

263
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,120
 It's a sequel and if it wasn't trying so hard up its own butt, I think it would be successful.

264
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,920
 I think I'd watch it.

265
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,920
 But anyway, so we have this movie Hereditary coming out and I am...

266
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,040
 I don't know.

267
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,400
 I've never seen a trailer for it.

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,240
 I have no idea what it's about other than what I just read.

269
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,160
 I'm not going to read the whole review because I don't really like spoilers.

270
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,480
 So the review... you know what, I'm going to watch the trailer right now and we will find

271
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,280
 out if it's scary.

272
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,360
 Maybe you'll hear a little bit of it.

273
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
 I don't know.

274
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,080
 Okay, well that was weird.

275
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,760
 That was pretty creepy.

276
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,160
 I'll give them credit for cutting a good trailer.

277
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
 Very interesting.

278
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,320
 Let me split it this way.

279
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
 Unfortunately, I'll probably watch it.

280
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
 I don't want to get fooled again.

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,520
 How many times do I have to get fooled by these movies?

282
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,000
 But so I'm going to watch Hereditary.

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,320
 I will get back to you.

284
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,080
 I think it's out now if it's not coming back.

285
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,480
 But let's go ahead and I'll go ahead and watch that.

286
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,040
 That was probably super boring for you to have to listen to a trailer and me comment

287
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,320
 only like every three or four minutes.

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,720
 But that's the way it works.

289
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,480
 That's the way it works on these semi-live podcasts.

290
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,600
 Well that's it for this episode.

291
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,080
 I am going to drink a soda and start editing this.

292
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 I hate to say that my life isn't more exciting than that.

293
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,040
 But I'm going to go ahead and edit this and get it out there.

294
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,960
 My name is Jason Carpenter and this is the 14th Family Podcast.

295
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:40,080
 If you are hearing a theme song or a song playing right now, that may be the theme song.

296
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 I don't know.

297
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
 Maybe.

298
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 I might have random songs.

299
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
 I don't know.

300
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 I'm like slowly raising as my voice is fading out.

301
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 If I'm doing it right.

302
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,080
 If not, it's just way louder than it needs to be.

303
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,080
 And I don't have a catchphrase to say goodbye.

304
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,080
 So maybe that'll be my catchphrase to say goodbye.

305
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
 I don't know.

306
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,080
 We'll figure it out.

307
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
 We'll be on this journey together.

308
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 I guess I just need bye now.

309
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 So bye.

310
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 Bye.

311
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 Bye.

312
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 Bye.

313
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 Bye.

314
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,660
 (upbeat music)

315
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,240
 (upbeat music)
