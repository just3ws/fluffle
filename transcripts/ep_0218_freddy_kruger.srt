1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 The Pine Gap Group. A simple CIA monitoring station or a gateway to other realities.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at the fascinating true story behind the nightmare on Elm Street.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Is there really a Freddy Krueger type demon that kills people in their sleep?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 We'll find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm so sweaty.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We've reached... guys, it has almost been a year.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 This podcast has almost been on for an entire year. We started in June.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I think it was June 14th, June 15th. Almost a full year of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I'm super stoked about that. I think in the back of my head I was like, "Oh, you know what I'm going to do?"

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I think in the early ones I go, "Oh, I'm going to do 100 episodes and we'll go from there."

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Almost a year, guys. Thank you so much for being part of this journey too.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Thank you guys are really the driver of this journey.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Speaking of which, I want to start highlighting some more fan art.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 You know we have something kind of interesting. It'll be in the show notes if you want to click on it.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I'm just going to have a gallery on there and then on YouTube you'll see it up here.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Merrick via Facebook went to... I did a story a while back about the Finn McCool,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 the giants who were basically like rolling around in the dirt. They weren't doing that.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 There were giants who were fighting and then one decided to become a baby and all that stuff.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 He went to the cave where this story apparently took place.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 He found the giant's causeway. It's not like he was Indiana Jones. It's on a map.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He went to the giant's causeway in Scotland or Ireland, one of the two,

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 and took a photo of it and sent it. He goes, "I went here because of the episode."

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now I don't think he was traveling from Alabama. I'm pretty sure he lived in the area.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 He's just like, "Oh, that's across the street." But still it's awesome.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Again, I never really thought the show would get like that, where people would hear something

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 and it would inspire them to go on a little trip. And that's amazing.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So thank you, Merrick. Thanks for that great photo.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We just have a ton of fan art we're going to be showing in the coming days and weeks and years as well.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 But let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Now our first story is interesting because I actually was joking about it and I go,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 "Who are these guys? What puts them on the same level as a vampire or a werewolf?"

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I wasn't aware of what the Pine Gap group was, but when I was reading Sherry Shriners' Prayer,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 she was telling everyone to be protected by this stuff,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 she mentioned along with witch doctors and Kabbalah priests and Saint worshipers to Pine Gap group.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So of course I was curious to what they were. At that point I was just reading it.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I was reading that live. Like I hadn't gotten that far into the prayer before,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 so I really was like, "Who are these dudes?"

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Alex F. on YouTube was like, "It's actually a real..."

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Because I said it's either totally fake or a super obscure conspiracy,

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 and Alex F. on YouTube said, "It is real."

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 The Pine Gap is a base in Australia. It's a satellite observation base.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So I started to look into what the Pine Gap group was, so thank you Alex for that.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And he's right, it is a satellite observation base in Australia, and it is so much more.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So bizarre, so bizarre.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 What it is, is that parent, as I'm reading up on it, is not a lot of information on it.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Even the conspiracy stuff is very, very sparse.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 But I'm reading up about the Pine Gap facility in Australia, and I'm like,

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 "Why does the US, why does the CIA, the NSA, and the NRO, which is the National Reconnaissance Organization,

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 why do they have a facility in Australia?"

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Now, Australia is an allied country to the United States.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 They're part of the Seven Eyes. That's seven countries that we allow information to be shared with.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And controversially, controvers...

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Anyways, it causes controversy because Australia can't spy on its own citizens,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and America can't spy on its own citizens, but what happens is the Americans will spy on the Australian citizens

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 and then give the information of the Australian government.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 That all came out during the Seven Eyes revelation.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So it makes sense that we would have an observation base there, but I'm still thinking like,

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 "Why Australia?" It turns out the Pine Gap, it's interesting because there's two levels to this.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 One, there's the legit conspiracies, like Seven Eyes,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 and then there's the wackadoo, nut job, Sherry Shriners stuff.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And actually, to be fair, I think Sherry Shriners is more the realistic stuff a bit,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 but the Pine Gap facility in Australia, it's in a perfect location.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It's one, it's in the middle of nowhere, so you don't have to worry about people stumbling across it.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Two, it gives it access to one third of the satellites that cover the globe.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And what it basically picks up, cell phone calls, it picks up satellite transmissions,

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 it picks up anti-aircraft and anti-emissile frequencies,

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 so they kind of know where all this stuff is moving.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So what's covered is all of China.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 All basically is Asia.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Anything that's satellite-based coming in or out of Asia is intercepted by Pine Gap.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The Asian part of Russia, so the Tatar Empire stuff is all intercepted.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I'm sure there's only like five satellites beaming down stuff to Siberia, but they can get them.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And then Middle East.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So originally it was set up there in the 60s as a Cold War preventative measure.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It could tell if missiles were being launched, and then it was being used to ensure that the nuclear treaties were intact.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But then after 2001, September 12th, 2001, they basically pivoted their entire operation to spying on everybody.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Now we get into the weirdo stuff.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Like, and I think that is interesting.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I had a lot of fun researching that stuff because they do have issues with government spying on their own citizens.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Wink, wink.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 They're spying on other people's citizens, but just trading information.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And Edward Snowden mentioned the Pine Gap Group.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 The Pine Gap Facility specifically when all this was going on.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Well, let's get into the weirdo stuff.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So in December 22nd, 1989, there's three hunters out in that area because it's the wilderness of Australia.

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 They're out there, they're hunting.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 They're actually getting ready to come back from their hunting trip.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And they see what appears to be a man-made camouflage door, a hangar door, in the middle of this field.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And they're like, this is out of place.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 This is totally not, it's basically like a giant metal hangar door with like a bunch of leaves thrown on top of it.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And they're like, they obviously are like, that's not something that should be here.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 There shouldn't be a big hangar door out here in the middle of nowhere.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 But then the door opens and a large silver disc flies out of the hangar and flies away.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And they're totally stunned by it.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 They can't believe what they just saw.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They actually tell a friend of theirs who's a university professor who ends up telling a local UFOologist.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And that's how we know about it.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So you're like, oh, cool.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 UFOs are involved in Pine Gap.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Oh, I'm not finished yet.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Not finished yet.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 That would have been interesting enough.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 In 1980, a police officer was helping the search for a missing child.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 How a child goes missing in the middle of the desert in the middle of the outback?

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Who knows.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 But apparently he's looking for, that kid must be like a track star.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 He's like leaving Melbourne and just running, just running for days.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Actually, maybe he got lost from the facility, but he's like this mutant kid.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He's Bat Boy they're trying to catch.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 He, 1980, he's in the area of the Pine Gap facility.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Looking for this kid sees a camouflage door.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 What?

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 He then sees what he describes as several bathtub shaped objects.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So you figure like, just like a, you guys know what a bathtub looks like.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I don't have to explain it.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Unless you have like a fancy, dancey bathtub that's like,

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 what if it's one of those standing bathtubs that the elderly people use?

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 He sees a couple of those fly out too.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Anyways, he sees several bathtub shaped objects fly out of the manmade covered door.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And he's watching them fly across the landscape.

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And then he goes in the hills.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Basically a black void open up and they flew into that.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So not another door.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 It was something that seemed unreal to him.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Traveled across the landscape, went into there.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 1973.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 There's a report again, some hunters by the Pine Gap facility.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 They're, they describe this.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 A blue beam shoots up into the sky from inside the base.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So they see the perimeter of the base and they see a blue beam shoot up.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And then a UFO, like a straight up traditional disc shaped metallic disc UFO,

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 begins hovering over the base about a thousand feet in the air.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And after a period of time, I think it was a couple of minutes, it then flies away.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And they report that.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 1984.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Big blue beam of light spotted coming out of the base.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 This time people see a weird cloud appear above the base.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And several triangle shaped UFOs and a cigar shaped UFO appear.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And then either leave or disappear, they're just gone.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Again, after a period of time, then the cloud sits there for a while and then disappears.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So it's interesting because obviously, obviously those things make you think,

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 they made me think of project blue beam,

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 where it's not necessarily that there were UFOs floating over the space,

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 but the blue beam was a holographic projector making the UFOs appear to be there.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Some people have said that the UFO seemed to go where the beam moved,

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 like the beam was shifting around the base.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So they were saying the beam was controlling the UFO.

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But again, it could have been that the blue beam was actually the holographic projector

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 putting this up in the sky.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Now, I poo pooed all over project blue beam in the episode that I covered that.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And these stories of the blue beam and the UFO are all around the same time

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 that the project blue beam theory was getting started.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But again, project blue beam was fairly, fairly obscure back then.

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Like back then, a lot of you guys, a lot of you younger kids have to realize

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 that back then, to be involved in conspiracy theories,

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 you had to track down books and magazines.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And you're like, "Yeah, of course, Jason."

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 But it was different.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Like you only had access to the conspiracy information that you stumbled across.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 There was no real cross referencing, unless you were Giles from Buffy.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Like you read a magazine or a book and that was pretty much all the information you had

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 unless you could find another book on that subject.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 There was no Amazon, your libraries didn't cover this stuff.

166
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So the fact that these people are telling stories about these blue beams

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 and these UFOs appearing,

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 it's possible that this was where the guy who created blue beam came up with this idea.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's possible that blue beam has an element of truth in it.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 The weird cloud would be what you would project the image on.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But I mean, again, that's so funny because that episode I completely dismissed project blue beam

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 as the rantines of lunatic and then I find this stuff.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And what I always find interesting is that when I'm reading about this stuff,

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 they never once referenced project blue beam.

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And when I was researching project blue beam,

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 they never once referenced the Pine Gap group,

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 which makes me think that one or both are true.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 If these guys, if on these sites they're like,

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "Because again, conspiracy theories were working in the dark back then."

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So nowadays it's easy to go,

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 "Oh, did you know Miley Cyrus is an Illuminati agent?

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Look at all these websites that agree with me.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Look at all this stuff that agrees with me."

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 As opposed to, "I have this theory that I'm going to come up with in Australia

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 of these events these people saw."

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And then in Canada, you have someone else come up with the theory around the same time

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 and they're both parallel to each other and they never reference each other.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It lends a little more credibility to it.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But then we get to Richard Saunders.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Richard Saunders and a couple other researchers

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 have really tried digging into the Pine Gap group.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And then it's almost like disinfo at this point.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So you go, "UFOs are being seen around this isolated facility.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 We know the CIA runs it.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We know that it's used to spy on people and intercept radio waves and stuff like that."

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And then someone else shows up and goes,

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 "Well, actually, you want to know what's really going on in Pine Gap."

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Apparently, there's a 5.3 mile deep borehole right underneath Pine Gap facility

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 that holds a death ray to shoot aliens.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 That's a really good way to fight aliens.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 They're like, "Oh, you bastards. Bring your ships right over Australia and we'll show you."

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 What? It doesn't really make sense if you can't rotate the planet at will.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's not the Death Star.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But anyways, there's a death ray down there.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It also can shoot up, apparently.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 This is actually a different conspiracy theory,

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 but the borehole can shoot up VF frequencies all around the planet

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 that actually extend 250 miles outside the atmosphere of the planet.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 For what reason? They don't really say.

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They just say, "It's capable of doing that."

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Even the people who invented it, they're like, "Why did we invent this?"

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And they're like, "Because we can."

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 They're like, "It's not doing anything. We don't even know if it works.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 We just want to do it."

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Some people believe that in this 5.3 mile hole, which probably doesn't even exist,

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 but there's a lot of conspiracy theories about this,

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I don't really think it's safe to build a base over a giant, gaping hole in your planet.

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Some people believe in this hole to where the elites are going to hide out at the end of the world.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Some people believe it holds a supercomputer that's so powerful that Bill Clinton once went there.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 You can tell how old these conspiracy theories are.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Bill Clinton once went there and he can go up to the computer and go,

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 "Can you tell me about Jason Carpenter?"

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And it's like, "Jason Carpenter, podcast host, lives in Hood River, eats coconut oil."

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 "You don't want to know what he does five times a day?"

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 He walks a lot.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This computer is so advanced, based on all the spy information and its own advanced AI,

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 it knows everything about everybody.

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 You can ask it, "Hey, so what do Britney Spears' kisses taste like?"

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And it's like, "Mmm."

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "Tastes like vanilla and sapphire."

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I didn't know sapphire had a taste.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yes, yes, kiss Britney Spears, you'll find out.

233
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But anyways, it knows everything about everybody.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Apparently, this is all...

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 This is a very crowded hole, if you haven't already.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Figured it out. Death Ray, antenna gun, a bunch of elites living down there.

237
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Now it has a supercomputer.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It also houses our time soldiers.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 So apparently, and again, I think this is the best way to wrap this up.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Oh, there's also a Stargate to go to Mars.

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You can go to Pine Gap and then walk through a doorway and end up on Mars and then suffocate.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 "I shouldn't have done this."

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But apparently, you can do that.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You can walk into Mars from Pine Gap.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And in the future, soldiers are trained to fight the wars of today.

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 [imitates laser gun fire]

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You won't have laser guns in the past.

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 The year 2018 is like, "Oh, yeah."

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 [imitates laser gun fire]

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Then, after all of their training, they are sent back to Australia.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 [imitates laser gun fire]

252
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Here's your orders.

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 They're like, "What's this?"

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You're going to go sit in this basin.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Do you just go to Germany?

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It's like, "Okay."

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He just sits there.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He's an MP.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Why would you train soldiers in the future and send them back here where there's basically like no major conflicts?

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It seems like a total waste of resources.

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Total waste of resources to send these trained future tech captain power soldiers to Australia.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And then just have them guarding posts in South Korea.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Total, total waste.

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But I guess if you have a time machine, I mean, you're going to have to use it.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 You have to prove that your budget is worth something.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So that is the story of Pine Gap.

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Maybe Sherry Schreiner wasn't as much as a nut job as I put her out to be.

268
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 She obviously knew about these guys and I didn't.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Thanks, Alex F, for the recommendation.

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And just a little tip here.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Just a little tip.

272
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Although Merrick did go to Finn McCool's cave and take a photo of it and visit it because the podcast--

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Don't visit this place.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Don't be like, "Hey, don't get arrested by these time soldiers.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 You're standing in front of a portal and you're like, "Oh, no, Dead Rabbit told me about your show.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He knows everything about you guys."

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And they're like, "Oh, we already talked to the supercomputer.

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 We know everything about Jason Carpenter."

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And then they push you into Mars.

280
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 So yeah, don't go there.

281
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Don't go there.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 As curious as you are.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Okay, but let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Now, our next story is part of our Too Good to Be True week where we're going to talk about stories

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 that you did not know were based on true stories, but actually were.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And this one I actually knew about.

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Because I watched the commentary for-- I love director's commentary for movies,

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 a writer commentary or whatever.

289
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I love behind the scenes stuff.

290
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 It's one of my favorite things.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And I was watching the director's commentary for "Nightmare on Elm Street"

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 and it had the actress who played Nancy on there.

293
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It had Wes Craven, the director, and I believe he wrote it as well.

294
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And then I think they had a producer and someone else.

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 In the commentary for "Nightmare on Elm Street,"

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Wes Craven says, "This is based on a true story.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 This is based on a true story."

298
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And someone else goes, "What?"

299
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And then he goes, "Yeah, yeah, this-- "

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "Nightmare on Elm Street is based on a true story."

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And he weaves this tale about what happened.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Now, what I'm about to tell you is a reference to a little bit in the show notes.

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But in the show notes, it mostly just refers to an interview he did for like "Cinema Blend."

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 When you watch the commentary, which is, again, the first time I heard about it,

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 this is the version I heard.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Back in the '80s, when he was living in LA, there was a series of articles

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 about these young Southeast Asian men dying in their sleep.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 What would happen is that they would start having horrible nightmares

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and then they would tell their loved ones, "I'm having the worst nightmares.

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I keep having these awful, awful nightmares."

311
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And eventually, they'd go to sleep and they'd die in their sleep.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And it was just these little-- as one after another,

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 a couple of them had passed away, but after there was a pattern,

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 you'd see a little blurb in the newspaper.

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Wes Craven would be like, "You know, I was reading the LA Times,

316
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and I'd see this little blurb, and I'd go, 'That's kind of creepy.'"

317
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And then eventually, the LA Times ran a longer story in 1981 about one boy in particular.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And again, he was from Southeast Asia, and he began having these nightmares.

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And he says, "If I fall asleep, I'm going to die."

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And his parents were really concerned, and they take him to the doctor,

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 and they're trying to get him to sleep, and they're trying to put sleeping pills in his stuff,

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and he's like, "Refusing it, he's refusing treatment."

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He's drinking a bunch of coffee, he refuses to go to sleep.

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He's like setting alarm clocks to go off at random times so he can't accidentally doze off.

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 He stays awake for four days.

326
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And then finally, in the end, he falls asleep.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I think it was on the couch, and the parents are like, "Oh, finally, you know, it's over."

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And they take him into the bedroom, and then they hear him yelling,

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 and they go in there, and he's dead. The end.

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And Wes Craven was like, "Oh, that is an awesome horror movie."

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So he creates the character of Freddy Krueger.

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And it's funny, because you're watching the commentary of this movie, of this dude just butchering people,

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 and just in the middle of it, he's like, "Yeah."

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And he goes, "The entire third act of the movie is based on that last article."

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Like, Nancy gets taken to the hospital.

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 It's funny, because now I realize, I'm assuming all of you guys know what the concept of Nightmare on Elm Street is.

337
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 This monster, he probably has one of the best origin stories of any serial killer.

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 His mom is raped by a hundred maniacs in an insane asylum,

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 and this kid is born, and then he goes, gets a job at an elementary school,

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 and he begins molesting and murdering these kids just one after another.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 He gets arrested for it. He gets off on trial, like, on a technicality.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 He doesn't get convicted. He goes back to just to his shack that's outside of the school,

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 and then the townspeople get together, form a vigilante mob, and burn him to death.

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And then he gets his revenge by now killing everyone else's kids.

345
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 All the people who killed him, he's killing their kids.

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 That is, it's basically Clint Eastwood as a bad guy.

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Like, that's a really great origin story for a villain.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I can't really think of another horror movie icon who has such a great origin story.

349
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I, yeah, I think it's just really, really well done. It's super creepy.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 He basically feels he's been wronged. He's like, "No, you should have let me keep..."

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 It would be one thing if he was convicted, and he wasn't guilty,

352
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 but no, no, he's like, "Oh, no, I love murdering kids. I'm totally down with that."

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 In the new remake, they actually explicitly said he was molesting them as well.

354
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 In the original versions, it was just kind of implied.

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 But yeah, he's basically like, he's not a wrongfully convicted spirit.

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 He's a serial killer who wasn't done killing people, and now he's killing people's kids,

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 to get back at him. Very, very interesting origin story for a killer.

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 But that's the concept.

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Is the story true, though?

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 West Craven said he read these news articles. Do the news articles exist?

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Yes, you can still read them today. You'll see them in the show notes.

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Articles from 1981, 1988, documented this stuff in the LA Times.

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 The question is, is it a real syndrome? Does it really happen?

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Or are the articles just taking urban legends and crafting them into an article?

365
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Not only does it happen, it happens so regularly, it's been named by the medical community.

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 This is absolutely bizarre.

367
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Originally, the designation of it was Oriental Nightmare Death Syndrome,

368
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 because it almost exclusively targets Southeast Asian men.

369
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 They're all tend to be young. Their average age is 33,

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 so that also fits with the idea of younger people being killed by this thing.

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 But 18 to your 30s, 40s around there, the medical community has no idea what causes this.

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's now been termed Sudden Unexpected Nocturnal Death Syndrome.

373
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It's basically the adult version of a crib death or sudden infant death syndrome.

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 But it targets a particular ethnic region.

375
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And the original working theory was you had all these young men who died in LA,

376
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 who were part of the story, had just left Laos.

377
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 They just left Cambodia. They just left these...

378
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 The Vietnam War, you know, Americans pulled out and it was still just a total quagmire garbage heap over there,

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 with all these regional warlords trying to consolidate power.

380
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 There's death camps, you had Paul Pot, you had these massive genocides,

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 and people were leaving the country.

382
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So they figured that there must be a connection.

383
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 These kids must have gone through so much stress in their young life that they're having heart attacks.

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 That's the thing. They're not even having heart attacks.

385
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 They think that what could be happening is that their heart rhythm goes out while they're sleeping,

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 which is technically a heart attack, but it's not ruled.

387
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 A heart attack, you just go to bed and die.

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It's not rare, either.

389
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 43... like, in America, it's set up like this.

390
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 43 per 100,000 people in these communities.

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Hmong, Cambodian, I think there's some from Vietnam.

392
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 43 out of 100,000 people. I had to do some context for that.

393
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I was like, that number, I don't know if that's higher or low.

394
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 That's four times the amount of automobile deaths in the United States per 100,000.

395
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Six times the murder rate.

396
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And 20 times the amount of people who die of AIDS.

397
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 43 per 100,000 is incredibly high.

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It was like, in the top four causes of death in these groups, it was bad.

399
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And what's weird is that none of the articles I read said it peaked during the period right after the Vietnam War,

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 but none of them said it's gone now.

401
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 No one's saying that it's gone now.

402
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And that's in general for people from Southeast Asia.

403
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Among the Hmong population, which we had a big Hmong population in Sacramento,

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 82 deaths per 100,000 people, and among just people in Laos in general, 92 per 100,000.

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 So all of those, that would be 60 times the rate of people who die of AIDS.

406
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 It's affecting this community.

407
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 This medical community doesn't know what's causing this,

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 but the people who are suffering from it know 100% what the problem is.

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 100%.

410
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 People in this region tend to follow a religion, or I don't even know if you could classify it as a religion,

411
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 but because it's not super organized, but animism.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So everything has a spirit, everything has a place in the universe, the universe is full of life and all of this stuff.

413
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So they use shamans.

414
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Instead of ministers preaching to them, they use shamans to help them connect it to nature, keep with one with the universe.

415
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 That's kind of hard to do when there's massive armies battling in your area,

416
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 and regional warlords and all of this stuff.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Now the Hmong helped the US troops control, they're very, very anti-communist.

418
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 They're helping US troops move stuff in and out of the area.

419
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 They're kind of like guerrilla fighters and things like that.

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 So when the United States left the area, they began pulling people out of the country.

421
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 They're like, "Get on, get on, get on the helicopter."

422
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 All that stuff.

423
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 They were evacuating people, they were moving people out of the country.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So you had massive amounts of people from Laos, Cambodia,

425
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 you had specifically the Hmong people coming over as well,

426
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 and they didn't fly helicopter the whole way, but anyways, they come over.

427
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But when they get here, instead of, you know how we have Chinatown,

428
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and you have like a Harlem, and you have these areas that where ethnic groups tend,

429
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Little Italy, you have these places where ethnic groups tend to congregate,

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 America was bringing these people from Southeast Asia to America and then just shipping them off to different cities.

431
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So they got spread out across 53 different cities.

432
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 The Hmong language wasn't even written down until like four years before they were coming to America.

433
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 So they knew their culture, but no one else really knew how to deal with them,

434
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 and then all of a sudden you're just taking two, three families, sending them to San Antonio,

435
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 two, three families sending them to Hood River, you're just moving people around.

436
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So they're completely cut off from their community, from anyone else who speaks their language.

437
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 They started to coalesce in parts of California, I think Fresno has a large population,

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I know Sacramento does, Minneapolis has a large Hmong population now,

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 but it took a while for them to kind of coalesce.

440
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Kind of hard to pick up the phone and call your people if you don't know their phone number,

441
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 you don't even know what state they're in.

442
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 This is what the people who are suffering from this believe in.

443
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 When they're not able to conduct their religious, this is so bizarre, in their beliefs,

444
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 when they're not able to conduct their religious practices, they are visited by a Dao Cha.

445
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Now a Dao Cha is basically a nightmare.

446
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 It's a personification of a nightmare.

447
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 We have the old hag syndrome where it's the sleep paralysis and something sits on your chest,

448
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 you can't breathe, and it's a scary nightmare, it causes sleep paralysis and things like that,

449
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 it doesn't kill you.

450
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 The Dao Chao though will.

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It takes the form that it's known, there's very very little information on this in English.

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 It's basically a demon that's a jealous woman, and that's all I could find.

453
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I tried looking for like more history on this person, super obscure, Dao Chao.

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Some people think that if you dress up, if you're male, and you, what's weird too,

455
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 is that there's only been one female victim of this sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome,

456
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 only one female victim recorded.

457
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Everyone else has been dudes.

458
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 The Dao Chao is this jealous woman spirit, and some people believe if you dress up like a woman before you go to bed,

459
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 she won't come after you because she thinks you're a girl.

460
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And if you're not practicing your spiritual workings every single day,

461
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 the Dao Chao will notice that and come to punish you.

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Like it follows, it'll slowly walk to find you.

463
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 It can sense that you're not doing what you need to be doing.

464
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But you have a bit of time, because first you'll realize, you know, I'm not really doing what I need to be doing spiritually,

465
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I'm not doing my workings, I'm not worshiping the earth and the spirit as I should.

466
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 You go to your shaman, and the shaman gets you back on the course, does some rituals,

467
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 helps purify you, gets you back into where you need to be.

468
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 But let's say you don't get to the shaman right away, you'll start to have these nightmares,

469
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 and they'll start to get progressively worse.

470
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And you know that you're eventually, these nightmares will lead to your death.

471
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 You know that whatever you're dreaming about is the Dao Chao coming towards you.

472
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So at that point you really need to go to a shaman and get blessed and have him work his magic,

473
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 literally around you, protect you, and get you back to follow your religious beliefs.

474
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 But you have a culture that's been evacuated from one continent, dropped on another,

475
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 and spread out across 53 cities.

476
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You don't know where the shaman is.

477
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You have no way to find anyone.

478
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And that's not me being like poetically like, "Ooh, look how spooky I can make this."

479
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 That's what they're saying.

480
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 They're saying, "This is what happened.

481
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 We have to follow our beliefs, or this demon will kill us in our sleep."

482
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And we don't know where the shamans are.

483
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 We got pushed all over the country and we couldn't find our religious leaders,

484
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 so we were dying off at 43 to 96 deaths per 100,000.

485
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Massive death rate.

486
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Now, like I said, they've started to coalesce into certain areas.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So you would have a peak of these demonic deaths,

488
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 and then as they started to reconfigure their culture and their society and were able to come together,

489
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 you would know where the shaman was.

490
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So I'm going to be like, "Oh, he's in Minneapolis."

491
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And it's not just one, you have hundreds of them, but you know what I mean?

492
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Like, if you're dropped off in the middle of San Luis Obispo,

493
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 you're not going to know anywhere where there's a shaman at.

494
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 So to them, to the Southeast Asian communities that are suffering from this,

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 or suffered from it,

496
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 again, there's nothing saying that it stopped.

497
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 There's no resources saying it only happened right after Vietnam War.

498
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 They're saying it peaked.

499
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 There's nothing saying it's over with.

500
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 They're saying, "Listen, we know it's not sudden, we know it's coming, it's not unexpected,

501
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 because we're not following our religion."

502
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And the medical community goes, "Well, maybe it's this, maybe it's this, maybe it's this, maybe it's this."

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And these young men just were dying.

504
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Part of me thinks that there has to be a medical reason for this.

505
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Some sort of genetic trigger in people from that region of the world.

506
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 It happens over there as well, but not as high,

507
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 which could be we don't have the record-keeping,

508
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 we don't have the medical facilities or the will to go over there and study this stuff,

509
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 or it could be that over there, they follow the religion a little closer.

510
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 When they start having those symptoms, those bad dreams, they go,

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 "Oh, better go pray to a bunch of vines or whatever."

512
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 But they don't have that opportunity here.

513
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 We cover a lot of weird beliefs on this show.

514
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And the last article I read up about this said, it's psychosomatic.

515
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 It's that people believe in this religion so much that when they start to fall behind in it,

516
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 they think it can kill them and it kills them.

517
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Case closed, it's all mental.

518
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 We cover a lot of weird beliefs.

519
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 We cover a lot of cryptids. We cover a lot of demons and paranormal stuff.

520
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But I think this one rings true creepily enough.

521
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 It rings a little true, don't you think?

522
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Like, it just seems like everything slots together so well.

523
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 All the information I've talked about, it's all in the show notes.

524
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 There's a ton of them. There have been a lot of resources dedicated

525
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 to finding out what's killing the Southeast Asian men.

526
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 But when it gets to the demon stuff, the trail just goes cold.

527
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 We talk about angels and demons. We talk about demonic possession.

528
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 We have that episode yesterday. We talk about all of this stuff.

529
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And people go, "Oh, that's faith or, you know, that's real or, you know, whatever.

530
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It's faith, it's a mental illness," all that stuff.

531
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 But when we have a repetitive, verifiable cause of death

532
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 and people going, "This is why it's caused."

533
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's because of this paranormal event.

534
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 At what point does the scientific community just keep shaking its head

535
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and going, "No, no, no, that's impossible?"

536
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And then again, even if they admitted it was true, what would you do about it?

537
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 How would society have to restructure itself if they said, "Yes,

538
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 if you are a Southeast Asian man and you don't pray to plants,

539
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 you will be killed by a demon woman."

540
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Next up on the news, 49ers had a passing play.

541
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I don't know anything about football, but you know what I mean?

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Like, if that was ever reported as fact, here's the thing.

543
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 There's more evidence about this than there is evidence for Bigfoot.

544
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 There's a cause-and-effect relationship here.

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 There's verifiable, all these dead, there's just way more stuff to go on with this story.

546
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 But knowing that Freddy Kruger is actually based on a real event,

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 a real reoccurring event, before you shut your lights off and go to sleep tonight,

548
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 think about that creepy story you heard as a kid, that scary movie you saw,

549
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 that urban legend you heard once and just dismissed as terrifying but not true.

550
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Think of those before you close your eyes.

551
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And then go, "I wonder if that one was true too."

552
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
