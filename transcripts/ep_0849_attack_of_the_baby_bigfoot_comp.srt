1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What would life be like if every time you took a walk, the universe was answering all

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 of your questions?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,200
 And then we traveled to Venezuela to meet a young man who's about to end his hunting

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
 trip.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,240
 He has some freshly killed animals in tow and his car is just a few yards away.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,640
 But that is when nature decided to hunt back today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,720
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,440
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and slide right into this first stop

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,240
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
 Everyone on your feet.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,920
 I want you to give a good salute to this dude.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
 He's walking on in.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,240
 I didn't expect this type of bump in circumstance.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,680
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
 Give it up for Rhett Stubblefield.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
 Wooo, yeah, come on in buddy.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
 Come on in.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
 Shut the door, you're letting all the heat out.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
 Rhett, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,880
 Just help spread the word about the show.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,360
 That really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,360
 Now Rhett, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,640
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,800
 We are headed all the way out to Prescott, Arizona.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,080
 And there's Rhett, thanks for flying us out here.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,640
 Now you fly around in circles while we get to walk around and have this adventure.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
 He's like, oh man.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
 Well he's up in the big balloon in the sky.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,920
 The rest of us are on the streets of Prescott, Arizona.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,160
 You'll learn very quickly that he's actually in the best place to be for this story.

35
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,400
 And here we're going to meet a man.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
 We don't know his real name.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,280
 He goes by the online alias Diligent Day 9158.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,400
 And Diligent Day recently posted this online.

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,240
 This post called "My Thoughts Are Connected To Sounds."

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,640
 So I don't know this guy's real name.

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,920
 We're going to call him Dave for short.

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
 But anyways, if that's your real name, it's just a shot in the dark.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,720
 We are sitting on this park bench in Prescott, Arizona.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,800
 We're just kind of sitting there enjoying the summer sun.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,520
 The warmth on our bodies.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
 And we see a young man walking up the street.

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
 Dave is what we're going to call him.

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
 That's his real name.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
 It's just a guess.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
 And Dave seems to be suffering from some sort of mental illness.

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,760
 Now I can't diagnose it over the internet through reading a post.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,920
 And definitely can't do it through a podcast.

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,960
 He doesn't really seem to diagnose it himself.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,280
 He does state that he's on medicine, currently on medicine.

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,520
 But his thoughts are still connected to sounds.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,000
 He's walking down the sidewalk.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,280
 And he's realized there's a pattern.

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,160
 If he is having an internal monologue, if he's thinking something, if he's trying to figure

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,400
 out what he should do, what the sound that coincides with the end of that thought is

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 the answer.

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,160
 If he's walking up the street and goes, "You know what?

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,520
 I'm wondering if I should go to the movies and see the Batman again.

63
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 Was it a really good movie?

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,160
 I'm still having a hard time making up my mind."

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,960
 And then he steps on some gravel.

66
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
 It's a universe telling him no.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,560
 The Batman was too long.

68
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,720
 Okay, really, wait.

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
 He already bought the ticket.

70
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
 He's already walking on the street with the ticket.

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
 He's like, "Oh, he's walking to the movie theater."

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 Oh, man.

73
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,920
 One of the things he's put together is if he hears rocks crunch under his feet when

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
 the internal monologue ends, then that means no.

75
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,640
 He is wrong in his thinking.

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,320
 But it's not just that.

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,240
 It's not just the rocks that are talking to him.

78
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
 It's everything.

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,920
 Horned honking, dogs barking, birds tweeting.

80
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,600
 These are all ways for the universe to tell him what he's doing.

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,120
 Is right or wrong?

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
 That seems exhausting enough.

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,640
 That really seems like you'd have to be really tuned into things.

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,560
 First off, you can't really listen to music, right?

85
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,040
 Because if you had your headphones on and you're having these thoughts, you may be missing

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
 out on these messages from the universe.

87
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,360
 Sounds super exhausting, right?

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
 But you could also say maybe there is a simplicity in that, Jason.

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,080
 Like, you give up and get God.

90
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
 What's the phrase?

91
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 What do people say?

92
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,240
 Give up and go God or something like that?

93
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,720
 He's on your football team.

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
 Give up and what is that?

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
 What is that?

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
 Let go and get God.

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,680
 I don't remember what it is.

98
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,160
 Apparently, it's a phrase that's basically saying just let go of all the control you have and

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
 give it up to God.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
 Let go and go God.

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 I don't know.

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,280
 Anyways, the point is, is that there is a simplicity to that.

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,920
 I would say that maybe you do look for signs.

104
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,040
 People do look for signs.

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,080
 But if the signs are any noise, any constant noise, I think it would just be exhausting

106
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,000
 to constantly be giving this up to the universe and saying, "It's yours, universe."

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,360
 But there is a simplicity to that.

108
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,440
 But what happens when he begins hallucinating noises?

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
 Jason, it doesn't matter.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,040
 It doesn't matter if the noises are real or not.

111
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,400
 It's crazy either way, Jason.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,520
 Whether or not he's hallucinating the noises or the noises are real, the noises are real

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
 aren't the point.

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
 Isn't the point.

115
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
 It is insane to leave decisions up to noises.

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
 And sure, true.

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,920
 But I think when they're hallucinating noises, it is weirder because one, it's a hallucination,

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
 right?

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,120
 And two, you're not letting the universe guide you.

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,000
 You're just making stuff up in your head at this point.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,840
 He says sometimes when he's sitting at home, he hears clicks in the wall.

122
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,560
 He'll hear clicks in the walls and the ceilings.

123
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,200
 Sometimes he hears noises coming from the neighbor's house and that also determines what

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,320
 he does.

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,880
 But then we get into this because this is kind of the core of it.

126
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
 This is where the sounds guide him.

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,920
 Because again, there are some people who leave life up to the toss of a coin.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,960
 They let the universe decide these things.

129
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,680
 Maybe it's not the toss of a coin.

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,120
 Maybe it's walking down a street and if you step on a rock, right when you're thinking

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,000
 of should I date her or not, the rock hurts your foot.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
 So then you go, I'm not going to date her.

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
 Now I don't know how many people do that.

134
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,440
 I don't know how many people do that, right?

135
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 But I got this quote from Dave.

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
 This is interesting because he talks about the origin.

137
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,080
 I'm always interested in the origin of mental illness.

138
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,200
 Quote, "There is a lot to the story that I can't cover in one post, but it began about

139
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,360
 a year and a half ago when I was living with a relative.

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,040
 I was reading spiritual books and got back into contact with something I'd forgotten

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 about in childhood.

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:56,040
 I don't remember the entire conversation, but it had something to do with free will

143
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,160
 as in, how much free will do I think I have?"

144
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,760
 Quote, "So right there, that's where this is coming into.

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,960
 It's the universe is telling him you don't really have free will.

146
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
 I am guiding you.

147
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,080
 All of these things that you think or most people think are just random noises is me,

148
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,680
 the universe trying to speak to you."

149
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,640
 It's really taken away all of that self-sufficiency because if you didn't make major decisions

150
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,280
 based on the sounds around you, you would never have to be responsible for anything

151
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,920
 you ever did.

152
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,040
 But you would, you would, let me finish this quote here.

153
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,520
 Quote, "I don't remember the entire conversation, but it had something to do with free will

154
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,000
 as in, how much free will do I think I have?

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,040
 I was physically tickled internally and was laughing about the subject.

156
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:58,200
 Shortly thereafter, I found myself naked in jail for trying to push over a large wooden

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:06,760
 cross in the yard, which I had a premonition of doing a year earlier."

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,760
 He may feel like the universe is telling him what to do, but there's laws and mores and

159
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,520
 things humans don't do to each other, i.e. pushing giant wooden crosses over while you're

160
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
 naked.

161
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
 You shouldn't do that in your neighborhood.

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,280
 If it's on, if it's on your own property and no one else can see, more power to you,

163
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,040
 but generally that is frowned upon.

164
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,880
 All of those things pushing over religious icons isn't looked highly on, and then doing

165
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,280
 it while nude is also, that's a crime.

166
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,680
 That's literally a crime.

167
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,360
 But the universe told him to do it, right?

168
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,560
 "Yeah, free will."

169
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,280
 Not only that, he saw it.

170
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 He had a vision of this a year earlier.

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,760
 How can we punish Dave?

172
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:59,320
 All they do, they put him in jail, and while he's in jail, he's hearing clicking in the

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,480
 walls.

174
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,880
 And sometimes when he's sitting in his cell, looking out his door, he sees the dead standing

175
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
 there.

176
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:19,600
 Ghosts and phantasms stationed right outside his cell, staring in at him.

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,160
 The clicking noises continue.

178
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,240
 It's interesting, a lot of this stuff, mental illness I find fascinating, I find it terrifying

179
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
 as well.

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,760
 In the world of the paranormal, the research that we do, these things aren't alien to us.

181
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,320
 Seeing ghosts in jail, they have prison tours, so you can see spooky ghosts, but not worry

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
 about them following you home, they're in ghost ale.

183
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,040
 The universe speaking to us, right?

184
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,680
 We've done episodes on that.

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,720
 There's tons of literature.

186
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,560
 There's tons of stuff, tons of stuff.

187
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,000
 There's sweaters and mugs based on let go and go God.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,760
 Individually, all of this stuff works in the lore.

189
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,600
 Premonitions, person seeing into the future, the being that had made contact with him as

190
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,160
 a child, now returning and having this communication with him.

191
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:24,200
 There is nothing in this story that we wouldn't believe if it was in another story.

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,840
 You know what I mean?

193
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,120
 I could do an entire episode, I could do an entire segment about a dude who's contacted

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,000
 by some sort of creature or demon or spirit as a child and now it's come back.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
 And that alone is just a paranormal event.

196
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,840
 And there is the possibility that some of this stuff is true.

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,880
 But when you add on mental illness, it really makes you question everything, right?

198
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,560
 It really makes you look at the details in a different light.

199
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,600
 If I had presented the story and not set up front that this person has mental illnesses

200
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,040
 currently on meds to take care of this, sprung that on at the ending, right?

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,280
 It would be a little befuddled.

202
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,440
 I think that in my opinion that this is not real.

203
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
 This post is real, but this guy is hallucinating all these things and he's hallucinating them

204
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,280
 because he knows they exist, if that makes sense.

205
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
 He knows the lore like we all do.

206
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,800
 I think a lot of mental illness would probably take the form of grey aliens.

207
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,240
 It doesn't mean that grey aliens are only due to mental illness, but if someone had

208
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,120
 mental illness and someone was super paranoid and they were afraid they were out to get

209
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,440
 them, they may see them as grey aliens.

210
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,360
 The grey aliens, that's funny now that I think about it, we don't actually see a lot of crossover

211
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,400
 of grey aliens actually abducting people with mental illnesses.

212
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
 There was a story, and I actually don't remember if I did this.

213
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,040
 I'll have to look through my notes, but there was a story that I had planned to do, I don't

214
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,840
 think I did it, where the aliens came down and they talked to this old man and they were

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,720
 going to abduct him and they go "No, you don't fit our criteria."

216
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 They left him.

217
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,800
 They did some scans on him and they're like "Nah, we're out."

218
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,040
 And then they left the student in the field.

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,640
 I wonder if aliens don't abduct people with mental illnesses.

220
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,000
 But yeah, it's interesting, everything in this story is possible in the world of the

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,240
 paranormal, but I think he's hallucinating.

222
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,960
 What's funny is the one thing that in that mental illness versus actual experience is

223
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,200
 the fact that he's connecting sounds to all of his decisions.

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,720
 That's very, very...

225
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,760
 That seems like a mental illness.

226
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,680
 That seems like you've completely given up on the randomness of life, and that's something

227
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,600
 we see in paranoid schizophrenics.

228
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,360
 That's why they can rhyme really well.

229
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
 They find patterns in everything.

230
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,320
 And that's why a lot of times when you're reading through posts and there's nothing

231
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,720
 just but schizo numbers, is what I call them.

232
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,160
 I'm sure other people call them that too, but they're entire posts of numerology.

233
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
 You can do that with tons of stuff.

234
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,680
 You can find patterns in anything.

235
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,360
 We've done episodes on it before.

236
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,920
 That to me is less paranormal and more insane.

237
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,480
 That's a border to me.

238
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,360
 I know people use numerology, and I know that there are cults that use numerology, but most

239
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,120
 of the numerology, I'd say 99% of the stuff you see online, is the result of mental illness.

240
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,000
 I could be wrong on that, right?

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It could be higher.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It could be 100%.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,960
 But yeah, connecting every decision to sound is what sets this as a mental illness versus

244
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
 paranormal.

245
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
 It'd be the same thing.

246
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,160
 Imagine this, because you guys might think I'm throwing this dude under the bus.

247
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,080
 I'm throwing this dude under a very loud bus.

248
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,400
 I think that if someone came to me with a story about them being abducted by aliens,

249
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,960
 and the aliens would come to their bed late at night and they would wake up with a little

250
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,760
 bloody dot on their wrist or behind their ear, where these implants were being put in, and

251
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,520
 they have this X-ray of the implant.

252
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:24,000
 If that was then wrapped up, that's a detail in a larger story about gang stalking, about

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,880
 how when he goes to the local Albertson supermarket, it always coughs twice in his left elbow every

254
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 time I walk by.

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,520
 And then I notice in the Campbell's food aisle, the Campbell's food cans are turned away from

256
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,320
 me.

257
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,360
 That's when I go with this dude's nuts.

258
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,800
 This guy, you know what I mean?

259
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,840
 You can have pieces of legit lore, but if it's wrapped in a larger, I'm being gang stalked

260
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,320
 by people who wear yellow shirts and drive black Subaru's.

261
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,680
 I see at least one of those a week, and I think it's the same guy just driving around

262
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 in my neighborhood.

263
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,960
 Yeah, that's where you kind of start to lose me.

264
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,960
 Dave says he's on medication for this stuff, but he's still seeing and hearing these sounds,

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,280
 and he's still connecting them to his thoughts.

266
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,920
 And you know what, really, on one hand, it doesn't really matter.

267
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 Right?

268
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
 Why am I covering this?

269
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,920
 It doesn't really matter in the long run if this guy is having these delusions.

270
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,600
 Obviously, my fear would be he's going to start making bad decisions.

271
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 He should have went to see The Batman again.

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
 It is a good movie.

273
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,680
 He's going to start making bad decisions based on what I, why am I saying he's going to?

274
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,520
 He got naked and tried to push over a giant wooden cross.

275
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,160
 So he's already making those bad decisions.

276
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,000
 But again, it's very interesting because we do have stuff that makes sense, that we believe

277
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 in.

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,560
 Spirit communication, synchronicity, premonitions, all this stuff we talk about on this show.

279
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,080
 And this, we have that crossover into hardcore mental illness.

280
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
 So yeah, just an interesting story.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,440
 To me, it just sounds so exhausting.

282
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
 Like I feel bad for the guy.

283
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,120
 I know I've cracked a couple of jokes, but all in all, man, it just seems so exhausting

284
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,160
 to be constantly going through that.

285
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,840
 Rhett's double field, go ahead and lower that dead rabbit dirgeable.

286
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,320
 He's like, "What are you doing here in that segment?

287
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 What was going on?

288
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
 I was trying to find a parking spot."

289
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,720
 Rhett, we're going to give you the keys of the carbonar copter.

290
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,840
 We're leaving behind Prescott, Arizona.

291
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,480
 We're headed all the way out to Caracas, Venezuela.

292
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
 [imitates caracas]

293
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,920
 Specifically we're headed to the wilderness outside of Caracas.

294
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:46,440
 It's April 10th, 1954, and the sun has set on this region of the world.

295
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,440
 There's a dude named Emilino Martinez.

296
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,600
 We're going to call him Emmy for short, because I'm pretty sure I butchered that name.

297
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,000
 Emmy is walking through the hills.

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,680
 He's headed back to his car after a very successful hunting trip.

299
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,440
 He's carrying his shotgun in one hand, and in the other hand, he's carrying some critters

300
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
 he's shot.

301
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
 What do they do?

302
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,280
 They normally like time together with a rope, throw the rope over their shoulder.

303
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,720
 Like some sort of huck-fin character?

304
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,280
 I imagine he was just blastin' rabbits or something like that.

305
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
 Nothing big.

306
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
 He had a couple of them.

307
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,480
 Anyways, he's walking back to the car with his freshly killed little animals.

308
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
 And he sees some movement in the bushes nearby.

309
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
 [imitates caracas]

310
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,360
 And he looks.

311
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
 And the noise has stopped.

312
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,080
 He's like, "Whoa, I guess I'm going to go see the Batman now."

313
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,600
 He looks over and the noise has stopped.

314
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,880
 And he continues on his way.

315
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
 It's the woods, right?

316
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
 It's the woods.

317
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
 Stuff is going to wrestle around.

318
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,840
 Leaves are going to move all spooky and stuff.

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
 And he's a hunter, right?

320
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 He's probably used to this.

321
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,000
 But it did catch him off guard that there was movement in the bushes.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,520
 He didn't really make out what it was.

323
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,880
 He starts walking again, and his car's nearby.

324
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,280
 He can see his car from where he's at.

325
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,440
 But he's not even thinking I'm in danger right now.

326
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
 He's a hunter.

327
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,600
 If every time a bush rustles and he got scared, he's going to be a very successful hunter.

328
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,760
 But while he's like, "Okay, I don't know what that was, but it was obviously nothing I have

329
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:24,120
 to worry about," walking towards his car, he hears from behind him a horrible guttural

330
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,880
 sound.

331
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,960
 Absolutely blood-curdling sound.

332
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
 Not literally, because that means his blood would actually curdle.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,360
 But the experienced hunter, right?

334
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:49,200
 And he hears something so primal, so terrifying.

335
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,720
 He knows this is not natural.

336
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,960
 He's never heard anything like it.

337
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,760
 And the reason why we know he's reacting with such terror is that he immediately drops his

338
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
 catch.

339
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,080
 He immediately drops the dead animals he was carrying back to his car and begins to run

340
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,160
 full speed to the car.

341
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,480
 He has no idea what made this sound, but he understands he doesn't want to be anywhere

342
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 near it.

343
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,240
 And he's running.

344
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,280
 He's running to his car.

345
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,120
 And the creature that's the only way he can describe it, right?

346
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
 The creature shouts out again.

347
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,400
 You're like, "Jason, that sounded like you were trying to be a T.U.X. for a little kid.

348
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,120
 Maybe I'll make it spookier.

349
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
 Maybe I'll have a bunch of sound effects.

350
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:48,880
 Sound of gravel getting crunched on."

351
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:57,760
 He hears this monstrous sound and he is running for his car and then he makes a mistake.

352
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,640
 His car is so close to him.

353
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,120
 But he turns around.

354
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,000
 As he's running, he looks over his shoulder and that's just enough to slow him down.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,920
 At this point, it's a matter of feet whether or not he gets away.

356
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:26,120
 He turns around to look to see what in the world is behind him and then he sees two creatures

357
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,280
 running full bore right towards him.

358
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
 It was dark.

359
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
 Right?

360
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
 The sun had set.

361
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,800
 It's nighttime.

362
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,040
 But how he describes him when he turns and he looks, he sees two short little dudes.

363
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,960
 Half man, half monkey, covered in head to toe in dark fur.

364
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,000
 He turns and he looks, these things are gaining ground so quickly.

365
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,040
 He pulls his keys out of his pocket.

366
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,840
 He goes to open his door and he drops them.

367
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
 Right in the mud.

368
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,880
 You see, I'm sure he's seen a horror movie at some point in his life.

369
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,800
 He kind of expected that.

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,960
 Before he can reach down to get the keys, something grabs him from behind.

371
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,280
 And even though these creatures are small, they are strong.

372
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,440
 This creature grabs him from behind and throws him off his balance and they both tumble into

373
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,400
 a nearby ditch.

374
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,040
 And while he's falling, he drops his shotgun.

375
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,640
 The creature then mounts him.

376
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,600
 That's like a little jiu-jitsu, chest mount and begins strangling Emmy.

377
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,760
 Massively strong furry hands, just squeezing tighter and tighter.

378
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
 But Emmy's not going down without a fight.

379
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,240
 He's swinging on this dude, right?

380
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,920
 He knows that if he does not get this little monkey man off of him, he's going to die in

381
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,680
 this ditch and he's swinging and he's able to throw him off balance and get this dude

382
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 off of his chest.

383
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 The mount is done.

384
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,360
 He's getting back up.

385
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 He sees the shotgun.

386
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,400
 He's not even thinking about that.

387
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,280
 He's focused on getting out of here.

388
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,160
 And as he's scrambling to his car, pants covered in dirt and mud, hands gripping at the soil,

389
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,360
 reaching for those keys, the second monkey man jumps on his back and begins biting his

390
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
 neck from behind.

391
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
 [grunt]

392
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,000
 Apparently, apparently that one's a pirate.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:40,280
 I'll make it super spooky through the sound effects.

394
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,240
 As he's getting bit, hairy hands are scratching at him.

395
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,200
 And at this point, this creature's on his back.

396
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,140
 He doesn't have a good way to fight this dude off.

397
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,640
 One of the worst fighting positions you can be on is a short hairy man holding onto your

398
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 upper back.

399
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,680
 Emi looks down and grabs a rock and just begins bashing this dude's head in.

400
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,320
 Can't get the best leverage.

401
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
 Can't get his full strength in it.

402
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,520
 But when someone's smashing a rock in your head, you know, 50% will do.

403
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,880
 He begins just smashing this little monkey man in the head and blood is now spurting

404
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,280
 out of this creature's face.

405
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
 [bats]

406
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,560
 And he's like stepping on a ketchup packet in a cafeteria.

407
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,440
 It's everywhere.

408
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,640
 The creature falls backwards.

409
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
 The creature falls backwards.

410
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,720
 Emi grabs his car keys, gets in and slams the door.

411
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,560
 And the second that car door is shut, both of those dudes, both of those hairy guys are

412
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,320
 now on his car and they're furious.

413
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,360
 They're just smashing their hands against the windshield.

414
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,600
 Emi puts that car in drive and is out of there.

415
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,280
 Little furry body's tumbling off the hood of the car.

416
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,000
 He holds down that gas pedal and he is out of there.

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,560
 And these two mysterious creatures illuminated by the taillights of his car.

418
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,360
 Okay, next day.

419
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,160
 Son, son is up.

420
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,680
 Emi goes back.

421
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,680
 Not alone though.

422
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,440
 Emi got a couple of his friends together, which I would have loved to hear that conversation.

423
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
 Emi's like, "Hey guys, can you help me out man?"

424
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,280
 I lost my shotgun up in the woods and they're like, "What happened to your neck man?

425
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 What happened to your neck?"

426
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 He's all bleeding everywhere.

427
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
 He's all scratched up.

428
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah.

429
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 You guys aren't gonna believe me."

430
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,600
 They're like, "Do we're gonna believe anything you say?

431
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,120
 You're obviously in a horrible fight."

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,000
 He's like, "Oh guys, listen, I was beat up by two little monkey men last night."

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,920
 And they're like, "Right, we don't believe you.

434
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 I'm sure it's...

435
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,480
 I don't understand how I would react if my friend came to me with a bunch of monkey

436
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,760
 bruises and bites and asked me to go back to the jungle with him.

437
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,480
 But these friends done better friends than I am.

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,160
 I would be like, "Call the cops man."

439
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
 They're better friends than I am.

440
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,400
 They go up the next day when the sun's out.

441
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,680
 They go up to this area and sure you would be suspicious about this, right?

442
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
 You're thinking, "Oh, maybe you just got drunk.

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,040
 Maybe you got drunk and hopped in a zoo and was wrestling with some monkeys and they

444
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
 bit you."

445
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 "No dude, that's not what happened."

446
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,320
 "That happened a couple weeks ago, sir."

447
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,080
 But this time it was not the monkey cage.

448
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,800
 They go up there and sure enough there's Emmy's shotgun laying in the ditch and the guys are

449
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
 like, "Well anyone can put a shotgun there.

450
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
 I don't know why they're so dismissive.

451
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,960
 I'm sure they believe them."

452
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,800
 There's a shotgun laying in the ditch and then there is blood.

453
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:31,080
 Blood that's only been there for a couple hours slowly dripping off of nearby leaves.

454
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,800
 Emmy and his friends started asking people in the area, just asking locals, "Hey, is

455
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 there anything weird?

456
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,720
 You guys see anything weird out here?

457
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,840
 Is Emmy still bleeding?

458
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 Is Eisel bloody?"

459
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
 He's like, "Uh, can I just go to the hospital now?

460
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,880
 No, we have to investigate this."

461
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,240
 They began asking local farmers and people who lived and worked in the area, "Is there

462
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,320
 anything weird going on out here?"

463
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,280
 And everyone had a story.

464
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,920
 These farmers and these people who live in the area are relating different stories.

465
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,040
 One farmer lost a couple cattle.

466
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,240
 Someone else lost a pig or two.

467
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,960
 One farm, they've had several sheep disappear.

468
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:21,480
 All a few farms and homeowners would complain that their dogs had gone missing.

469
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,200
 And there was also talk about two young farmhands who traveled up into the hills, the same hills

470
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,800
 that Emmy was on on that fateful night.

471
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
 They never came back.

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,040
 Two young men traveled up there.

473
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,600
 We're never seen again.

474
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,880
 There's an interesting relation to another story.

475
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,720
 We covered a long time ago in episode 455.

476
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 Back on November 29, 1954, there were two men just passing through Caracas.

477
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,960
 They're actually closer to the city itself than not far off in the hills.

478
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,060
 And they stop and see, I think it was three small creatures walking around the UFO.

479
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,560
 They were also completely covered in hair, but they wore loincloths.

480
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,880
 And these dudes pulled over and proceeded to start a knife fight with these aliens.

481
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,480
 I'll say this about Venezuela.

482
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
 I'll say this about Venezuela.

483
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,440
 They did not miss a round when it comes to aliens.

484
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
 I thought it was interesting.

485
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,760
 That story took place in November 1954.

486
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,240
 And that story is far more well known compared to this one.

487
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,520
 I think I might be the first one connecting these two stories, even though they took place

488
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,720
 around the same area.

489
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,920
 And definitely in the same year, it's so weird how UFO-ology stories, stories of cryptid

490
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,560
 sightings, don't get connected.

491
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,640
 For whatever reason, I think it's because one was in one book published in 1972.

492
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,240
 The story that I just gave you was from a book called Triangle of the Lost by Warren

493
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,720
 Smith.

494
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,240
 You have that and then you have other journals talking about these other stories that are

495
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
 more popular.

496
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,760
 And I also want to site the website alienexpants.com.

497
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,440
 That's where I found it from.

498
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,000
 They have this whole thing about Bigfoot Alien, the Bigfoot Alien connection and stuff like

499
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 that.

500
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But yeah, it's weird.

501
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
 Both of these took place around the same area.

502
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,960
 Both of them had a lights in the sky thing.

503
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
 Both of them were related to UFOs.

504
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,720
 Are these creatures the same?

505
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,600
 They were both hairy.

506
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,880
 So were these a Bigfoot offshoot type of creature?

507
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
 Were these baby Bigfoot?

508
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,280
 That's probably what I'll title the episode, because it sounds funny, but was it a baby

509
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,840
 Bigfoot?

510
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,880
 Was this an alien?

511
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 Were these both aliens?

512
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,720
 And after they got beat up in the hills, they decided to start wearing loincloths?

513
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,760
 Maybe that's a show of shame on their planet?

514
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 What?

515
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
 You got beat up by a dude?

516
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 Here's clothing.

517
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
 Who knows?

518
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
 It's probably okay to be fair.

519
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 It's probably not that one.

520
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,920
 It's probably not that one.

521
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,280
 Is it connected?

522
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
 Likely.

523
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,760
 Very likely.

524
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,600
 But either way, whether it's aliens coming down to beat you up, or just two cryptids

525
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,360
 wandering through the woods to beat you up.

526
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,520
 And remember, they killed all these other animals in these farmhands supposedly, right?

527
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
 I mean, the farmhands could have, they could have stole all these animals themselves and

528
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
 started their own farm in another country.

529
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,040
 It's a happy ending for them, but these creatures definitely had murder on the mind.

530
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,800
 They've slain a lot of animals already, and possibly two humans as well.

531
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,920
 And they were going to do the same thing to Emmy.

532
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,480
 Again, this is one of those stories that shows how terrifying this phenomenon is.

533
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,120
 There's a very high likelihood that Emmy would have just died up there.

534
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
 Right?

535
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
 He would have gone missing.

536
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,480
 If anyone went looking for him, they might have found the shotgun.

537
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,720
 They definitely would have found the car.

538
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,480
 I don't think these little creatures are inspired enough to put the car in neutral and push it

539
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,320
 into a nearby lake.

540
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,920
 But someone would have noticed him missing, got worried, searched the area where they

541
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,600
 figured he was hunting, find his car, and that'd be it.

542
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,280
 I was talking to my buddy Carson the other day about the Barbara Bolick story.

543
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,400
 I'll put that episode in the show notes, but to sum it up, it's a woman who went missing

544
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,520
 within a 45 second time gap in the forest.

545
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,880
 Someone was looking at her, turned, looked at this valley, turned back, she was gone.

546
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,360
 That's not a paranormal story that is a lie.

547
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,160
 And is an active missing person's case.

548
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,600
 Police have no idea what happened to her.

549
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 None.

550
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 They get no blood, no shotgun, no car nearby, none of that stuff.

551
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,080
 I was telling the story to Carson who's a seasoned hunter, he's an outdoorsman, and

552
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,280
 pretty much like right when I got done saying it, he goes "Kuger, mountain line."

553
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,120
 He said one of the two, I don't remember which one exactly he said, he jumped out of the tree

554
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,240
 and got her and dragged her off and I was like "What?"

555
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
 He's like "Yeah, it can happen that quickly."

556
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,360
 I go silently like when someone's like 45 seconds away.

557
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,600
 He's like "I probably would have heard something."

558
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 Most likely, because that's how dangerous nature is.

559
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,760
 Your life could end.

560
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,600
 Our ancestors were like "We're out of here."

561
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,760
 We got out of the wilderness as quickly as we could.

562
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,280
 We stayed close enough so we could have water and close enough so we could hunt them when

563
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
 we needed to.

564
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,800
 But you didn't have a bunch of people living in the deep, deep woods of an area.

565
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,160
 Actually, I don't know if that's true.

566
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,280
 I just know when I play Age of Empires, the first thing I do is cut down on the trees.

567
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
 You get out of the wilderness, man.

568
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,440
 That's where the monsters live.

569
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,840
 When I'm saying monsters, I mean like real ones like bears and mountain lions and stuff

570
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,040
 like that.

571
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,920
 So if someone went missing in the woods, someone died.

572
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,080
 If Emmy went up hunting and he never came back home, they're going to assume he was

573
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,240
 killed by a natural beast.

574
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,800
 Drug his body off.

575
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,720
 Aed him.

576
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,280
 And his bones are somewhere lost to time.

577
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,960
 But that makes this story even more creepy because it would turn out his predator was

578
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,320
 unnatural.

579
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,800
 These things shouldn't even exist.

580
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,640
 He didn't even know something like this was possible until they were biting the back of

581
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,000
 his neck and strangling him in a muddy ditch.

582
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,680
 Think about the fear he was going through.

583
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,840
 It's bad enough to get killed by a mountain lion that jumps out of a tree and snaps your

584
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
 neck instantly.

585
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,760
 You kind of expect that might happen when you're hunting in the wilderness.

586
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,160
 But imagine if you were an avid hunter who'd grown up in the woods.

587
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,960
 You were prepared for almost any contingency and there you are on your back in a ditch.

588
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,280
 You're car just a few feet away as this monstrosity is throttling your neck.

589
00:32:50,280 --> 00:33:00,720
 It's crushing your windpipe with its thumbs as its grip gets tighter and tighter and tighter.

590
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:14,040
 You would be so terrified you were being killed by something you didn't even know could exist.

591
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:21,560
 And as your vision begins to go blurry and your eyelids become heavy as you feel the

592
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:27,960
 breath leaving your body for the last time.

593
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:37,640
 You see a look of rage on this creature's face as it squeezes the life out of you.

594
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:48,280
 And looking up at the night sky you see a glowing white disk appearing overhead.

595
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,480
 You thought you were prepared to face anything the wilderness had to throw at you.

596
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:23,560
 But you weren't prepared to protect yourself from the darkest corners of our galaxy.

597
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:40,600
 You were prepared to face anything the wilderness had to throw at you.

598
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:51,680
 You were prepared to face anything the wilderness had to throw at you.

599
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,040
