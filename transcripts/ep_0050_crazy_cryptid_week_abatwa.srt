1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Was there really a race of ant-sized humans prowling the jungles of Africa?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And a real-life superhero is protecting the streets of Stockton.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you're having a great day.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hope you're staying cool. Oh man, I was doing a bunch of research.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Actually, what's originally going to do for today for our cryptid, I was going to do the Fresno Nightcrawler.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And I kept looking, I had it all ready to go and I said, "You know what, I'm gonna see if anyone's debunked this yet."

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And yeah, it's been pretty thoroughly debunked actually.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 When I was watching the debunking video, I'll put it in the links below just for, you know, if you want to check it out.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But when I was watching the debunking video, I was arguing with it in my head and then I was like, "Nah, I'm grassmin' at straws. I'm grassmin' at straws."

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Fresno Nightcrawlers, if you don't know, are these creatures that look like they're just a pair of legs walking through the city of Fresno.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And the guy really laid out and said this is how they did it and he replicated it and he explained where the footage came from.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And at first I was like, "No, no, you're wrong. Like, you didn't explain that properly."

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And so like, I had a natural inclination to argue with him because I wanted to believe in it, plus I already did a bunch of work getting the episode prepped.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But at the end of the day, I was thinking, he's basically doing what I'm doing.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Like, he may not have all the answers, but he has enough, I think, to thoroughly debunk the Fresno Nightcrawlers.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But we'll post all those links, you can check it out yourself.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Anyways, so I was like, "Crap, I need to find another cryptid."

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And I'm like, "You know, I have all these bookmarks, I have all these folders, and I'm clicking them."

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Like, "That cryptid's stupid, that cryptid's dumb, that cryptid doesn't exist at all.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 There's not an interesting story behind it."

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And I kept reading these cryptids that lived in Antarctica, and I was like, "Oh, man, that would be so nice right now to be sitting in Antarctica."

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 "Ugh, just that cold wind whipping over my exposed skin."

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I don't care, the thing could be there. I'd be there.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Apparently there's a giant turtle that's as big as an island that floats around.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 See, that was the thing, that was one of the cryptids I came across, and he floats around Antarctica and stuff like that.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 But it's such a limited amount of information, as neat as the visual is, there's really no story behind it.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So I had to keep looking and keep looking.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And so that's when I found these little guys.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So we're going to go ahead and start off with our cryptids with this, because we're just nice little segway there.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 These guys, and we're still in Africa.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I actually had planned on having cryptids from different areas. It's just kind of working out.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And I think part of it is that I wanted to do cryptids that no one's ever heard of, that I'd never heard of.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We know, you know, that the western cryptids are pretty well known.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I think there's some in Australia that aren't really well known, but mostly it's in like Asia, Africa.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 We know all about dragons and bigfoots and gnomes, and I guess there's something called the bat-squatch.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I might do an episode on, but again, there's just, there's only one account of that.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 These little guys. So let's talk about the abattoir.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Abattoir, A-B-A-T-W-A. These little guys.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So apparently this was more of a legend. That's actually true.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 That's what's so interesting about this story.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The Zulus had this legend of the abattoirs.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 They are so tiny. They live in the grass, or they live in ant hills, and they like hang out in the grass all the time.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And they're, they can like, can ride ants, they can beat up ants. They're that tiny.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And their spears, their tiny, tiny spears are dipped in poison, and so they will, just one spear.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Like you can be like a lion, and you take one of their spears in the ankle.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's uncontrollable bleeding. It basically prevents you from blood clotting.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And so you can run as far as you want, but eventually you'll just die, plus the poison gets you.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And then the little guys eat every inch of you. They leave nothing to decay.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 They eat everything. All the bones, all the hair. So nothing's left.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And once they eat everything there is to eat in a certain area,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 they all jump on one horse, the whole group of, the whole tribe.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 They didn't have like houses, because they lived in ant hills, but there was like thousands of these guys.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 They got men, women, and children. They would all jump on one horse, and they would line up from the top of the head

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 all the way down, like a perfect line, all the way down to the tail.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They'd be like giddy up, and the horse would ride to where there was more food.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And then they would do that process again, where they hunt and kill everything in the area.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Now the Zulus hated these guys, because they were super temperamental.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And a lot of times you would just be walking through the grass,

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 and you would accidentally almost step on one, or maybe like kill a couple of them,

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 and they would stab you in the foot with one of the arrows, and you'd die.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You would just bleed out, and I don't know if they ate you necessarily, but they'd kill you.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And they were also really, really, really self-conscious about being short, like super self-conscious,

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 where they would kill you if they thought, the Abat-Wa, if they thought you were thinking,

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 just even thinking that they were tiny, they'd kill you.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So the Zulus, this is all historical by the way, I'm not just making this stuff up,

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 because this story gets weird.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So the Zulus had a special greeting for these guys.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They'd say, "I see you, and like, you're so big, I can actually see you."

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And then the little guy, the little Abat-Wa hunter, his follow-up question would be,

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 "Well, where did you see me from?"

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And the Zulus would be like, "Oh, I saw you like five miles away. You're so huge, I saw you like five miles away.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I saw you on top of that mountain over there."

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And the little hunter would go like, "Okay."

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Like, it would make him feel good that he wasn't considered tiny, that no one thought he was tiny.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 If you said, "Oops, sorry, I didn't see you there, they'd kill you."

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Or, if you go, "I see you," and they're like, "Where'd you see me from?"

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And they're like, "Well, you're kind of tiny, so I just saw you run out, they'd kill you.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You can never insult their height."

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And the Zulus, again, were not fans of these guys, because they were losing soldiers to these people.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Constantly paranoid, they were going to get snuck up on or killed.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And their weaponry was just too advanced.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 They always said that one Abat-Wa tiny, tiny soldier was more powerful than a full-sized Zulu,

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 because just the weaponry was different, plus they were silent assassins.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So there was an author named Henry Calloway, and in 1868 he wrote a book called

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 "Nursery Tales, Traditions, and Histories of the Zulus," and in this book, these stories are in there.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So it's basically like a book for white people to read in England and Europe.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Being like, "Oh, look at those crazy black people. They weren't calling them black people,

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 but I mean, that was the-- I'm churching it up for you."

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So what's interesting is Calloway's doing this research, and he starts to come across some things.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 The term "Abat-Wa" isn't just the name of these tiny little guys.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So Calloway, as he's researching this book, he's hearing these stories about the Abat-Wa and everything,

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 and he's like, "Okay, yeah, you say that they're super tiny, and they don't like to be criticized for their height.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Okay, yeah, and they'll like kill you if you make fun of how tall they are.

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Okay, yeah, and he's writing that down, and he starts to do some more research,

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and he realizes there is a tribe near them called the Abat-Wa.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Like, there's actually people still in that area called Abat-Wa.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 He's like, "What the-- Okay, so wait, it doesn't make sense,

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 because what they're calling these mythical people are actually a legitimate tribe in this area."

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So he realizes there's another tribe in this area that's named after these legendary creatures.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So what are you going to do? You're going to go look into that.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So Zulus are generally six feet tall.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 This other tribe, the Abat-Wa's, were four feet tall.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So now he's like, "Oh, okay, so basically this is what happened.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Long, long, long time ago, Zulus warriors met these guys who probably mouthed off about how short they were

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 and got massacred by these dudes. Definitely took some casualties."

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So then legends grew from that, that there were these tiny warriors that lived in an hills,

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 and they all rode on one horse and don't-- Saying that's the key point.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Don't criticize their height, because they'll kill you.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Now, I get that if that tribe was extinct, but imagine if you made up a legend about something.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Like, you're like, "Hey, yeah, don't go over to Barry's house, because Barry is a ghost,

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 and when you walk into that house, he'll attack you and he'll try to put mushrooms down your pants,

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 and then he'll steal all your gold, and Barry's still alive."

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And he's like sitting on the porch, and he's like, "Wait, I'm sorry, what?

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Did you just say I'm gonna put mushrooms down people's pants? Like, what is going on?"

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That's basically what they did. They made up an urban legend,

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 and basically in front of the people who the urban legend's about,

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 which I guess kind of happens in some way. We call them rumors.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 But you're basically criticizing a group of people for being shorter than you

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 by creating a legend about they're so tiny, you can fit the entire population on a horse,

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 and then telling that story to your kids, and then those kids are like playing with their kids.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Who, I'm assuming their kids actually are as small as ants, because they are pretty short.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Super bizarre. So that's that part of the art.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 You're like, "Okay, they named this group of people after this group of people who are still around,

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and they're saying they're super tiny."

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And then these researchers come in and start to compare these four feet tall people to urt garden gnomes.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And they're like, "In Europe, the gnome is very well known to be fierce, and critical of his height,

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and he will take your gold." They're still talking about these dudes who are literally in the next tent.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I mean, I don't think they're buying these books.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Listen, it's one thing to tell stories of lesions,

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 but it's probably not the best thing to tell them about people who are still alive,

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 and the legend is how much they like to kill people, regardless of their height.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 The whole thing is super bizarre.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Then, I'm reading this, and I'm like, "Okay, so just basically everyone's ragging on these guys,

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 who are just sitting there doing their stuff."

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I mean, I don't know. Maybe they are murderers.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Okay, so the article is just full of craziness, but there's a journalist term called "Bearing the Lead,"

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and that's where you take the most important part of the story, and you hide it somewhere in the middle.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Not necessarily the most important part as far as this goes, but definitely one of those parts.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And I was like, "Tell me more about that. Quit talking about earth gnomes. We get it. You don't like short people. We get it."

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I read this, and I'm like, "This is its own article. I couldn't find anything on it just yet. I'm going to keep looking."

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Anyways, here it goes. This researcher who came out, this is like 1915 now,

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 he comes out and he's like, "Hey, who made all these pots? Who made all this pottery and stuff?"

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And one of the elders of the tribe said, "Oh, that pottery right there? That's what you're talking about?"

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That was made by the Goomba, and it says, this is a sentence here.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It says, this is a sentence here.

148
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 "The elders of the tribe told him that the pottery had been made by an ancient people called the Goomba,

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 who had originally occupied the area in the past after displacing a race of cannibal dwarves,

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 called the Methiniocaenae, cannibal dwarves. How tiny are these people in Africa?

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 The fact that we now have dwarves, I mean, think about it,

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 if you're already comparing some people to the size of ants and they're only four feet tall, how tall were these dwarves?

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I get it, pygmies exist and stuff like that, but was this an issue? And they're cannibals, cannibal dwarves.

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I got to find out about these guys. Will that be its own cryptid episode? I don't know.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 There should have been this one, because this one was just about tiny humans, and I don't know if that's technically a cryptid,

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 but I do think the story of how we got the legend of tiny cryptids was perfect for Dead Rabbit Radio.

157
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I hope. We're going to move on to the next story here, and this is a story I've been following for a long time,

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 but there's a new update in it. So, the city of Stockton has a guy in Stockton walking around calling himself Batman,

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and he stops people from doing meth, and just crime in general. Where is he? He hangs out at the dollar store,

160
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 and apparently, I mean, I don't know if you guys know what the dollar store is, if you know what a 99-cent store is,

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 or a 98-cent store is, basically a store, everything is 98 cents, 99 cents a dollar.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Some dollar stores, oddly enough, have stuff that cost more than a dollar, and I don't know how they do that, but they do.

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But anyway, so in Stockton, which is a crime-ridden hellhole by all measure, I'm from California, so I can say that.

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I have friends actually down there in Stockton, and it is a crime-ridden hellhole, but so apparently there's a guy who calls himself Batman,

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 walking around Stockton, the parking lot of the dollar store being like, "Stop, you'll do it," and his kids are with him.

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Now, I'm not going to knock the idea of wanting to stop crime. That's very noble. I have no problem with that.

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And I have no problem with people taking the law of their own hands. I guess I kind of do.

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I mean, yesterday I talked about to catch a predator in the pop squad and all that, how they go to stop child molesters,

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and that's kind of what he's doing. I don't really think you should bring his kids into it.

170
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 If he wants to call himself Batman, fine. If he just wants to walk around and be like, "Hey, I'm calling the cops right now,

171
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and call me Batman," if anyone asks who I am, I don't really have a problem with it.

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I don't have a problem with real-life superheroes in general. What that is, is that's a movement or a group of men and women

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 who dress up. This guy doesn't dress up. He's just walking around wearing a tap-out shirt, but I'm assuming it's tap-out.

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 That was a bit of a stereotype, but real-life superheroes are what it is. Real-life superheroes.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 There are men and women who generally dress up in costumes and patrol cities, and if they see a crime happening, they call the police.

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Fair enough, and a lot of times they also do charity work, so they'll dress up as the Red Avenger or Captain Awesome,

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 and they'll be like, "Hey, here, take these sandwiches home with people." Fair enough. I mean, you can't fault that stuff.

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I think that stuff's interesting. There was a great documentary called Superheroes that HBO did quite a few years back.

179
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 It was 2007, something like that. It's a look into all these people's lives, and some of them are like these three young kids in New York,

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 and they're like, "Yeah, we got bullied a lot, so we decided to gang up. We lived together, and we train all the time,

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 and we're constantly lifting weights, and we patrol the city, and we do all this stuff."

182
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 There's another guy who's built this armor. He's wearing spandex, and then he has armored suit.

183
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 That's given too much credit. He has this giant battering ram that he fits onto his arm to punch stuff.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Hopefully not people, and they show him testing it out on the... Like, he has this thing of balsa wood,

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 and he's like, "Watch this. Bwoosh!" It crashes the balsa wood. He's also drinking quite often during his routine,

186
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 during his patrol. They show him cracking open a couple beers, and he pretty much is just hitting on chicks.

187
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So basically, there's all sorts of levels to this. Some people are in it for the fame. Some people are mentally ill.

188
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 One guy they profiled was living in his van, but it was worth it because he was fighting crime.

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 When you watch that documentary, and of course that documentary, I was like, "Oh, I had two things. One, I want to be one."

190
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 That lasted about 34 minutes. And secondly, I wanted to know more about him.

191
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It's funny because you look into him, and this happens a lot in the documentary. A lot of them, they'll be like,

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "I'm a superhero because of Kitty Genovese." Kitty Genovese is this incredibly famous story.

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 True story. Tragic story. I think it was in like, '74, in the '70s. I think. My facts are always, if I don't have it in front of me.

194
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Anyways, Kitty Genovese was a young woman who got attacked in broad daylight, and while I think maybe 12 people were standing around her,

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 a bunch of people were watching from the apartments. This is New York City back in the '70s, and that, what we talked about, a crime-ridden hellhole,

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 was incredibly bad. People were watching from the windows. A guy is stabbing her in the middle of the day on the street.

197
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 She starts to bleed out. He leaves. He gets away. I think they caught him later on, but...

198
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And eventually, some people came out, and they're just like walking by her, just standing there. Nobody does anything. She dies.

199
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And that was a big, like, wake-up call where people were like, "How could we as a nation let that happen? Let this young woman get stabbed?"

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And people were there. It wasn't like it was in the middle of nowhere. It wasn't like a gunshot in a dark alley. No one knows where it came from.

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 People watched her die. Watched the attack, and they watched her die. No one did anything.

202
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And so that was like, if that is one of those things where you have to ask yourself, like, "What would I have done in that situation?"

203
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And back then, I think people were just in New York, particularly more apathetic towards just crime in general.

204
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I don't want to get involved. It's not worth my trouble, or I don't want to get involved. I could be dangerous for me. Things like that.

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 I think definitely, if I saw a crime happen, whether or not I would intervene would be determined on a couple different factors.

206
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 If I'm walking down the street and I see a man getting mugged by another man, the chances of me intervening into that is much greater than if I'm walking down the street

207
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and I see a man being mugged by what I know is a street gang.

208
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Whether it's a single gang member or four or five gang members, I'm going to call the cops, maybe, maybe, again, depending on--

209
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 because I'm not-- if I'm sitting there and someone's holding something up or whatever, I'll do my best to get involved.

210
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But if it's an actual, active, more than f*cking buddy's street gang, f*ck that, dude. I'm not getting involved.

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 No. I may come over and do some CPR and stuff like that, but not-- for me, if I got to be honest, no.

212
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 If I see a bunch of bloods messing with somebody, no. I'm good.

213
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Anyways, I guess-- I guess that's a good segue for where I'm going with this real-life superhero thing.

214
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Hey, man, I'm just being honest. Like, I'm being honest because then I got my family involved. This is the way I look at it.

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 If I want to get involved in a fight between people and I get stabbed or something happens to me, so be it.

216
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 But if I get involved in some-- if I'm trying to get involved to protect someone from some sort of gang activity, some sort of multi-state gang--

217
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 and again, I'm not talking about the dudes who all wear the same shoelaces and there's some podunk street gang and it's like five dudes,

218
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and you can mop them up in a weekend. I'm talking about, like, a big gang, a multi-state gang, a multi-city gang.

219
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 If I seem doing something, it's not just me I'm involving in a situation, it's my family I'm involving in that situation.

220
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 You know what I mean? It's good-- you know, I could go out and be the hero and all that stuff, but, you know,

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 then all of a sudden I'm a witness and I'm on trial and they want to shut me up so they go do this, that, and the other thing.

222
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 For me, it's not worth it. If you want to get involved in it, go nuts. But I've learned-- I've learned. No, I'm not doing that.

223
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Anyways, where I'm going with this-- real-life superheroes-- so you have these people who are pretending--

224
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 and they're not pretending they are actually heroes, they are getting involved. Apparently they're more heroic than me because they would be like,

225
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "Hey, stop you. You stop." A member of the Third Street Bloods who has massive financial holdings and all sorts of businesses in the area

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and probably has a couple police paid off, put that purse down and, you know, where they were let go.

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I'm glad this is the episode where I reveal what a horrible scumbag I am. It's not what I intended.

228
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Let's get back on topic. Real-life superheroes-- there are people who dress up in costumes and they go out and they stop crime.

229
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So what comes out of that? There's a group of people who call themselves real-life super villains.

230
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Now, of course, when I hear that, I'm like, "Oh, I'm already like pretty disappointed because we already have real-life super villains."

231
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They're called the criminals. But these people take an extra step. So real-life superheroes, what they do is they see a crime,

232
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 they call the cops, and they hand out coffee and donuts to poor people. They don't actually punch criminals in the face.

233
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So what would you think a real-life super villain would do? Do you think they'd try to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?

234
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Do you think they'd be involved in some sort of petty larceny? At least? No, they just make YouTube videos.

235
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 They just troll real-life superheroes and they're like, "Haha, you suck. The sandwiches you give out to poor people are stale.

236
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Subscribe to my channel for more." I was looking into these guys preparing for this episode. They're mostly defunct at this point.

237
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 One of them was doing a joke campaign for president of 2012. So it should show how updated these real-life super villains are.

238
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And to make it even weirder, the real-life super villains, they post YouTube videos talking about how lame superheroes are,

239
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 and then they give out sandwiches to poor people. Like, they use... I get it. I'm homeless. All I want is a sandwich.

240
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 But I don't know if I can take one from Dr. Doom. I don't know if I can take one from somebody who claims to be a villain.

241
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I'd be like, "Here, eat the sandwich that you don't know who I am or who made it." Captain America gave me a sandwich.

242
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I'd be like, "Yeah, Cap. Keep fighting them Nazis." If... Dora-Mu, what's that guy's name? The flaming head is like walking down Skid Row

243
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 and he's like, "Sandwiches for all." Come on, man. I would like to see a real-life super villain.

244
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I think we have had real, real-life super villains. I think the unabomber would be the closest we have to an actual super villain, Osama bin Laden.

245
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I would consider a super villain where they have... They're above the average. Like, Timmy D. McVeigh was just a punk with a van.

246
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 But the unabomber was like... It was this decade-long mystery. He's building these little bombs. He had like his own little hideout.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Osama bin Laden, it goes without explaining. He had his thing going on. But to like...

248
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Osama bin Laden, what he had on Pat was those videos that he made, too. Which, you know, I don't speak Arabic, so who knows what he was saying.

249
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 We only have what the translator is saying. But imagine if one year everyone's watching the Super Bowl

250
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and instead of watching it in the commercial for the new Diet Pepsi brand...

251
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I lost my Diet Pepsi sponsorship, by the way. I never had it.

252
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 But anyways, during the Super Bowl, right when the ads, when everyone's like, "Yes, my favorite thing about watching the Super Bowl is the ads,"

253
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 which is the most annoying thing you can ever say to me. I hate it when people say that.

254
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 But all of a sudden, it starts up and there's like Cobra Commander or some sort of guy in a mask there being like,

255
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 "There are nuclear bombs planted in three American cities. If the Lions lose the Super Bowl, two of them go off."

256
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I don't know. And then it just ends. That's supervillain-y. That's what I want to see.

257
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I don't want that to happen, but that's supervillain-y. This was a really rambling episode.

258
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I'm going to blame it 100% on the fact that I'm dripping with sweat. This may be the hottest I have ever been as a human on the planet Earth.

259
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be our email address.

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'm drinking soda. I'm the Coke I'm drinking. Oh, sorry, Dipepsi. I mean, the diet Pepsi I'm drinking right now is hotter than room temperature, if that's possible.

261
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. You can also hit us up at Twitter, Twitter @JCNLCarpenter. It's going to be that.

262
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 We're going to go, I got to turn these fans on, dude.

263
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day. I'm extremely happy you listened to it today.

264
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Little rambly, but I hope you had fun. Have a great one, guys.
