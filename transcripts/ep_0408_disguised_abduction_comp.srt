1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 You steal a man's iPad.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 You find horrible images.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 What do you do next?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at two stories.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 The implications are chilling.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Is it possible that human beings aren't simply being abducted by aliens,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 but we're being lured to areas to make it easier for them to get us today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm here. I was Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 You're like, Jason, I can tell you're sick.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I can tell. I've been listening to the show for a long time.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I can tell when you're sick.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Yes. Yes. There's a lot of episodes where I've gotten sick

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 and I always get allergies this time of year.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's nothing to panic about.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 The problem is, when I lay sleeping on my back,

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 it all gets into my esophagei.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Because I'm a dude, so I have an esophagei.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Women have an esophagus. I bet you didn't know that.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And it just gets all gooey inside there.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So I'm miserable.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But that doesn't mean I'm not having a great day,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 because I am having a great day.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Just have a little bit of a head cold.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I went outside for a little bit, man.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I did some steppin'. I got on a stair.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I just walked up and down it 120 times.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And just staying moving.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I think I'm going to do a home workout routine,

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 because I'm self-isolating.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I'm self-isolating here.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So here's where we're at right now.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Not talk about me. This isn't Jason's video blog,

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 or vlog, is what you kids call it.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 This is Dead Rav Radio, where we talk about crazy stuff.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So let's go ahead.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 That was a tour. That might have been the worst segue I've ever done.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But whatever.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 So let's go ahead.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I was supposed to talk about this story yesterday,

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 and I ran out of time for it.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But I've actually, this is a story that I've kind of...

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I've told variations of this story throughout the years.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's not like I made it up.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It's not Goldilocks and the Three Bears,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and I'm slowly refining it.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This happens every so often.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And each time you get different results from the people involved in it.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But recently, let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We're driving up. The borders are closed.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Let's hop on board the Carvener Coptor.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We're going to Canada. We're going to Regina.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That's in the Saskatchewan province.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In Canada.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's February 23rd, 2020.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So like just a couple of weeks ago,

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Dude walks into a police station.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And he's sweating.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 "Oh my God, you don't have the coronavirus, do you?"

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And he's like, "What? No, that's not news yet.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's only February 23rd."

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The cops are like, "Oh yeah, yeah. We're not taking it seriously over here yet."

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And the dude's coughing on him.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Touching all their paperwork.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He goes, "So, officers, I have a problem.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 It's not a respiratory illness. I have another problem.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I'm being extorted."

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 The cops are like, "Oh, you've piqued our interest."

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You know, a lot of times, police work.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 It's boring.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Traffic stuff. And then you got domestic disputes,

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 which is like super dangerous work.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And you know, it's just a bunch of boring stuff.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 You want to be driving around in cars,

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 shooting bad guys.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 But this isn't that. You're not driving around shooting people.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But it's something different than

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 this guy's playing really loud rock music.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Can he tell him to stop? This guy comes in and says,

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 "I'm being extorted. I'm being blackmailed."

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Police officers go, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Police officers go, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 It's like my Kindle. I'll never know what happened to Bella and Edward.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Jeremy goes, "Oh, no, no, no. It's none of that stuff."

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It's full of child porn.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It's just full of a bunch of child porn is all.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And she's threatening to release the child porn

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 to all of my friends and family

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 if I don't pay her X amount of dollars.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And so the cops go,

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 "Okay, yeah, that's a whole extortion.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Whoa, blackmail. That's like the worst crime

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 we've ever heard of. We actually have a division

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 dedicated to just stopping blackmail.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Why don't you come into this room

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 and log on to this computer here

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and show us the emails she's sending you."

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And they're like, "Oh, I'm so glad I thought you guys

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 were going to be mad about all the child porn."

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And they're like, "No, no, no, what? No way, dude.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Here's your email."

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And they're like, "I'm so glad I thought you guys

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 were going to be mad about all the child porn."

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And they're like, "No, no, no, what?

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 No way, dude. Here, just go ahead

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 and log into this official police computer."

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Yeah, go ahead. Okay, get the camera right here.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So we show your face

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 and fingers at the same time, type in your password.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Okay, good, good.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 He pulls up these emails from this woman

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 saying, "Hi, I sold your iPad

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and I found all the child porn on it.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Pay me X amount of dollars

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 or I'm going to release all the child porn."

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And in the email were photos

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 from his iPad of child porn.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And the officers go,

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 "Oh, are those the photos

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 that are from your iPad?"

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, those are from my iPad."

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And, "Okay, sir, you're under arrest.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Why under arrest?

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Because you have put child porn on your iPad."

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He just told us that, "Oh, dang, now it.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I thought you guys took extortion work seriously."

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Well, the cops did

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 because then they pretended to be the guy

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 they emailed her, the person who stole the iPad,

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and said, "Hey, I got the money.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Where do you want to meet?

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I'll pay you the money."

135
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And the woman goes, "Oh, that's so perfect.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I'm so tired of having to email people child porn."

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 She meets up in the middle of the park.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Cops arrest her.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The one dude gets charged with child porn,

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 which is obviously a horrible thing

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 to get charged with. It's a horrible thing to do.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 She gets charged with extortion

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 and distributing child porn

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 because she emailed it to him.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So the reason why

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I've told the variations

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 of the story throughout because

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 there's a heartwarming version of the story

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 that I've always loved to tell.

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And this is that. There's an old story.

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 This old story. Some kids

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 broke into this dude's house,

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 checked all of his stuff,

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 stole his laptop, stole a bunch of his stuff,

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 left. And then when they were

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 back at their little hideout, back at their

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 where the footclan hangs out,

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 it's like an arcade and a skate ramp

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and all this stuff. The teenagers are using

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 his stuff. They turn on his laptop full of child porn.

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 They call the police and say,

162
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 "Listen, dude, we broke into this dude's house.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We stole all of this stuff,

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 but..." And we admit to all that,

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 "But this is super gross."

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And the cops took the computer

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 and didn't charge the kids. And the dude went to prison

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 for like 20 years, because there was like a ton of it

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 on there. There really doesn't even have to be a lot.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Any small amount can get you a serious time.

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But I always liked that story. That's what you should...

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 First off, don't break into people's houses.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But if you ever have a hankering to like

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 smash a window and steal something, and you

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 happen to find this stuff, don't then try to

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 blackmail the guy. Just turn it over to the cops.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Like what was her best case

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 scenario? That she was going to meet a guy

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 and he was going to give her like $10,000

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 or something like that. She was going to give him back this

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 iPad. And then she would know

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 that this guy, this grody dude

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 is walking away with his collection of

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 child porn. And she's like,

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 "Ha ha ha! I got all this money!"

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 That's blood money right there.

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But anyways, they're both facing

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 massive charges and all that stuff.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Gross, if that ever happens to you,

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 not that your child porn collection

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 gets stolen, but if you ever like

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 stumble across someone else's stuff, turn it over to the police.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So there we go.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 A story of two gross people

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 running into each other. She should have just

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 turned it in. She would have been a hero.

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 But instead she's a zero. Just like him

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 in jail. Don't do drugs.

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 You know, this, I mentioned

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 a couple episodes back. I said,

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 "This is an episode of Bad Transitions."

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 A couple episodes back, I said,

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 "If this show's too dark for you

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 because everything else is going on, I don't mind

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 if you skip a couple of episodes

206
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 or stop listening to podcasts all together and come back later,

207
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 or whatever."

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 You're under no obligation to listen to me.

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I really enjoy it, and I really enjoy spending the time with you guys.

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But I also wanted to give a shout out to another

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 podcast that I listen to.

212
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 It's called the Black Heart Cinema Podcast.

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 It's a group of dudes who do, they talk about movies.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And they basically do about one movie and episode,

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 some episodes they've done two.

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's one of those things that, one of the things I like about the podcast is,

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 they talk about the movie,

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 but you can tell they have a passion

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 for film in general.

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Because first off, they did an episode about,

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 this also set them apart.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 They reviewed a porno movie, so that obviously

223
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 set them apart.

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Recently though, they did an episode that they

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 gave a shout out to me. I want to return the favor.

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 For the movie, "Triple X," starring Vin Diesel.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And as they're talking about it, you can tell

228
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 they have a passion for film because they just start going,

229
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 talking about like 90's,

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 early 2000 action movies in general.

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 They started talking about the genre and how it changed.

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And we saw that

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 change from "Triple X" to

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 the new James Bond versions

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 in the comparison. These guys know their stuff,

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 is what I'm saying. Some people can just

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 sit and talk about movies, read an IMDB

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 page and call it a podcast. That's not these guys.

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 They actually seem to have a passion for it

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 and a knowledge about the movie. So I recommend you guys

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 check them out. Also, dude, they need some

242
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 subscriber love. Right now, they got 15

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 subscribers over there. They got 66

244
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 episodes out, so they've been putting in

245
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 work, it comes out every week. They've been doing

246
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 it for a long time. Let's get them some subscriber

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 love over there, Black Heart Cinema

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Podcast. They're on

249
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 EveryWaryListener Podcast and YouTube as well.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Now, I want, let's

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 move on to our next topic. Our next topic involves

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 two different stories. And I'm going to tell you up

253
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 front that this is

254
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 a, this is something similar we've

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 covered before. So I don't want to feel like

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I'm ever repeating myself, but this is

257
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 similar to something we've talked about

258
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 before. But I think it's important. It's more

259
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 information involving a phenomenon that

260
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I mentioned a long, long time ago.

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 But let's go ahead and strap

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 in here. The first story

263
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 we're going to look at, I don't have

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 a location for, I just have a month.

265
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So, take with a grain

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 of salt is what I'm saying. That's, that's

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 might be the least amount of

268
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 information I have for a story.

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But it's been backed up by other stories

270
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 that I've told in the past and another story I'm going to tell this

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 episode, so we're going to go with it. It's January,

272
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 it's 1989, at night

273
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 there's a husband and wife. And

274
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 they're sitting at home just kind of doing their own thing

275
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 reading the newspaper, wife's cooking dinner,

276
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 or let's not be sexist, maybe the man

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 is cooking dinner and the

278
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 woman is baking.

279
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 So, anyways, they're doing their own thing and

280
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 they both get, they both

281
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 get a hankering

282
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 to go to a movie. So they're standing

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 in the kitchen, he's cooking, she's

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 getting her cookies ready, and they look

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 at each other and they go, let's go see a movie.

286
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Now it's 1989, so what are they, what are they

287
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 watching? They're watching the Deep Six,

288
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 what is that, Deep Star Six?

289
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It's 1989, what's at the theater? Terminator

290
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 2 hadn't come out yet. They

291
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 decide to go see Deep Star Six.

292
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So, they get dressed up, they're going

293
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 to cosplayers, they dress up in underwater

294
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 suits, and they get into their car, and they

295
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 drive to the

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 movie theater, and they watch Deep Star Six, and they're like

297
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 "Eh, I was okay."

298
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 You know, a decent creature feature,

299
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I guess.

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 You know what you're going to do. So,

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 they walk out of the theater, they get in their car,

302
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 they leave the theater,

303
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 driving around town

304
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 at night. A town that they live in, by the way,

305
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 they didn't travel 500 miles

306
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 to go see Deep Star Six opening night in Hollywood.

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 A town that they live

308
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 in, driving around at night.

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And they're trying to get home,

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 right, that's what you do after a movie.

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 You drive, and they're coming down the street,

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and there's construction set up,

313
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 like a roadway block, and they're like

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 "Oh, that's..." They must have started

315
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 building something in the two hours

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 we were watching the sci-fi

317
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 cinematic masterpiece

318
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Deep Star Six

319
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Do-it-you-turn, start driving the other way.

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Coming down another road,

321
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 flashing yellow lights,

322
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 road crew equipment there. No people!

323
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Just the

324
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 barricades in the road.

325
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 What? That's weird.

326
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 They start to realize

327
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 that everywhere they turn

328
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 there's construction.

329
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But there's no one actually

330
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 doing anything there. They also begin

331
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 to realize they don't remember

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 how to get home.

333
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 They're driving around

334
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 for hours.

335
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And then finally they get home.

336
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 A weird night, obviously.

337
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 They get home, they're like

338
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 "The movie was mediocre, the most exciting part

339
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 was the fact that the city seemed

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 to surround us, but we're home."

341
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And as years went on

342
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 they'd always kind of be like

343
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "That was so weird, remember when we went to go see Deep Star Six?"

344
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Apparently this episode

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 is a plug for that movie.

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And they go "Yeah, it's so weird."

347
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 But I don't remember

348
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 everything was blocked off and they'd be like

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 "Yeah, I just have a hard time

350
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 really remembering anything about the movie."

351
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Except for the lukewarm performances

352
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 of George Clooney's cousin. And I think Clint Howard

353
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 was in it too. And she's like "What?"

354
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 He's like "I don't know, I don't know. I'm having

355
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 vague memories about Deep Star Six now as well."

356
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Years later they decide

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 to get hypnotized. Now this makes

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 sense because

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 we have hypnotism, regression

360
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 stuff like that. It's always been

361
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 in vogue, at least since the 70's

362
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 80's. I remember when I was a kid a lot of people

363
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 were doing it. Not a bunch of kids. Kids were like

364
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 "What do you want to do for your birthday party, Billy?"

365
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 "Pass life regression!"

366
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 You have sort of a clown that's hypnotized

367
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 me and like "You used to be a monk."

368
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But it was in, when I was

369
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 a kid I would see people on television

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 talking about getting hypnotized and stuff like that.

371
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Hence the name of Biggie's hit song.

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So

373
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 they decide to do the hypnotism thing.

374
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And this is what they remember

375
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 now something more concrete about that night.

376
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 They left a movie theater.

377
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 They drove to a church parking lot.

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 They remember that.

379
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 They remember

380
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 a flying saucer

381
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 hovering above them in this empty church parking lot.

382
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 They have flashes

383
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 of gray aliens reaching out to them.

384
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Of being pinned down

385
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 to medical tables.

386
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Of painful procedures

387
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 of painful procedures.

388
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 they notice something later as well.

390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 In the real world, outside of their memories.

391
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 The wife

392
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 she used to have a blood clotting disease.

393
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It's now gone.

394
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Now you're going Jason, that story is kind of ridiculous.

395
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 You don't have a place.

396
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You don't have names of people.

397
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You're missing key parts of information.

398
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 You can't even tell us the town it took place.

399
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That's fair.

400
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And you think

401
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 if you got abducted by aliens

402
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 or you went to see deep star 6

403
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 she got lost. You don't know where you're at.

404
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 You get home. And then

405
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 between that and getting hypnotized

406
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 she didn't realize that her blood clotting disease was gone.

407
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I mean I don't think you feel it.

408
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I don't think you're like oh the clots.

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 The clots they hurt. I don't think it works that way.

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 But if she was a hemophiliac

411
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 and her blood didn't clot

412
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 did she not get caught. It's suspicious.

413
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 But it's an interesting story. Because if you will remember

414
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 long time ago

415
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 and I tried to remember

416
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 in what episode it was I couldn't.

417
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I talked about a thing called disguised abduction.

418
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It was a short story

419
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 where a woman got in a car crash

420
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 and

421
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 she had a hard time remembering

422
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 which will happen after a car crash.

423
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 But there was like a car crash or she saw a car crash

424
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 and she couldn't

425
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 drive around it or something like that.

426
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I vaguely have memories of it. I don't know if the aliens got to it too.

427
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But the point is that there was a weird

428
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I think it was a car. That was it.

429
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 She was driving on the road and there was a car crash

430
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 but there was nobody in any of the cars

431
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 and she was like this is weird.

432
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And she was kind of like looking around the car crash

433
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and then eventually after a period of time she drives away.

434
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And then she had

435
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 she remembered

436
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 through hypnosis there was a UFO

437
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 the car crash was completely made up.

438
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 There was a UFO that abducted her

439
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 and experimented on her. And the theory was

440
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 was that

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 the aliens we've always heard this

442
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 story of like false memories

443
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and it's kind of the idea that

444
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 you get abducted

445
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and then you get put back on earth and you're like

446
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 oh I don't remember all of this horrible stuff.

447
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 It turns out the aliens may actually

448
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 be able to

449
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 create completely false memories

450
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 in you. Not you go to bed

451
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 you wake up you don't remember being abducted.

452
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You go to work

453
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 and you go into the bathroom stall

454
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 you get abducted and then you remember

455
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 the rest of your day at work.

456
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 So when you wake up at home

457
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 this morning you're like oh that was weird.

458
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Of course then there's other people there

459
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 and be like dude where'd you go you went to the bathroom stall you disappeared

460
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 for like 10 hours. You walk in here you're all sweaty

461
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 you've something sticking out your butt you obviously got anal probed

462
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 what? Oh I didn't even notice that.

463
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But if you were in a

464
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 solo environment or like in this case

465
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 husband and wife together

466
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 both going out and

467
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 that's the other creepy thing.

468
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 But we'll get to that in a second.

469
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 We'll get to that in a second. Let's take a look at another one of these stories.

470
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 February 11th

471
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 1989

472
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Levittown Long Island this is 9pm

473
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 we're getting some more information on this one.

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 There are these two

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 musicians in their apartment who I can only

476
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 assume are the Beastie Boys

477
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 hanging out in their apartment in Levittown

478
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I think they're in the Bronx it doesn't matter.

479
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 These two guys these two musicians

480
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 were fighting for their right

481
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 to party making music

482
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 in this apartment. I'm sure the neighbors

483
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 loved these guys I'm sure they were totally awesome.

484
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And they start to hear

485
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 weird noises. Noises

486
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 that are weird because they're not making them.

487
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Someone else is being annoyingly loud.

488
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And both dudes run to the window

489
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and they look and they see four

490
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 military helicopters

491
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 cut across the night sky.

492
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 In the four helicopters are not flying

493
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 in a line they're flying in formation.

494
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 They're flying in a box.

495
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And in the middle of

496
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 the helicopters

497
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 is what they describe as a massive

498
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 shiny vehicle.

499
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Saucer shaped?

500
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 We don't know.

501
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But definitely not

502
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 human.

503
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Not identifiably human.

504
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 These two dudes look at each other.

505
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Whoa dude. They run

506
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 they get in their car and they begin driving through

507
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 the city of Long Island. That's a city right?

508
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 They're driving through

509
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 the area known as Long Island

510
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Levittown. And they're looking up

511
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 through their windows and they can see the four helicopters

512
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and the

513
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 metal ship flying in formation with them.

514
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 They start to get on the expressway

515
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and then all of a sudden

516
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 the four helicopters

517
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 break formation and start to fly away.

518
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 The metal ship becomes a flaming

519
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 ball.

520
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And then both of them black out.

521
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 The next thing they know

522
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 they're turning onto a bridge.

523
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 What?

524
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 What was that? I don't know. You saw that right?

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Yeah, yeah, the helicopters and the

526
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 shiny vehicle. There's multi-colored

527
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 lights flashing all around it. Yeah, it was

528
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 weird. And turned to fireball.

529
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 You say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but weren't we just on the expressway?"

530
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Now they're just silently

531
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 they're not silently they're talking but now

532
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 they're driving across this bridge

533
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 in Long Island.

534
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Later on, months, years later, we don't know

535
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 but later on one of the young men

536
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 remembers

537
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 things.

538
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 He remembers

539
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 being in a room

540
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 with gray aliens.

541
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And he remembers seeing

542
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 hieroglyphics everywhere.

543
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 The hieroglyphic motif

544
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 is, I'm starting to see

545
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 is very common

546
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 in alien lore. Now I don't,

547
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I am not a proponent of ancient aliens.

548
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I will say this.

549
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I think it's possible that aliens have visited

550
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 us in the past.

551
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I don't believe that all of our

552
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 great wonders are because of aliens. I

553
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 believe that humans

554
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 are so uniquely advanced.

555
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We built the pyramids. We built

556
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 these temples. We built all

557
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 of these things without any alien

558
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 intervention. So

559
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I don't think they're necessarily Egyptian hieroglyphics.

560
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 A lot of times people say they're hieroglyphics

561
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and then when I did that story recently about the scientists

562
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Deep Prasad

563
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 he said they were hieroglyphic. Look,

564
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 if I saw weird symbols

565
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 that seemed to be showing

566
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 some sort of, like a guy

567
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 walking, I would describe it as hieroglyphic.

568
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 It doesn't mean that it's actually hieroglyphic.

569
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Deep Prasad said

570
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 it reminded him of hieroglyphics.

571
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Deep Prasad is a quantum

572
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 scientist. He has the language

573
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 for these type of things. If I just saw him and said

574
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 they're hieroglyphics, I don't necessarily think aliens

575
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 were messing around with the Egyptians

576
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 helping to build temples. Because if that was

577
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 true, hieroglyphics is a really, really

578
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 primitive way to write things.

579
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 So if the aliens were coming down

580
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and teaching the Egyptians how to write, they sucked

581
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 at that. I think what we're

582
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 seeing is their language.

583
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Well, now I'm kind of knocking the aliens language too,

584
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 but maybe they do have a sucky language.

585
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Or maybe the best way we can look at it

586
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 is a hieroglyphic. And really

587
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 it's this super advanced thing. I don't know. But anyways,

588
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Egyptian hieroglyphics aren't the most

589
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 advanced writing form on the planet.

590
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I don't... they're not

591
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 even in my top ten personally. And I'm a big

592
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 writing dude.

593
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I love cursive.

594
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Whatever the steady... stenography.

595
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 No, that's not it. Doesn't matter.

596
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 The point is, is that both of these stories,

597
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and the story I told in an earlier episode,

598
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 have some chilling things

599
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 going on. One, it's the idea that

600
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 you can be abducted

601
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 and you're given

602
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 this memory that

603
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 halfway makes sense.

604
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 That's weird. It's almost like...

605
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and it makes sense from an alien point of

606
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 view. If the alien is trying to

607
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 replicate the human experience, but doesn't understand

608
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 the human experience,

609
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 it just says,

610
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 "Oh, we need to keep... we need to fill

611
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 your brain with memories for a while."

612
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And we know humans drive down

613
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 roads,

614
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 so we're going to put

615
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 barricade... but see, that doesn't make sense.

616
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Like, as a human, you'd be like, "Why are there all these barricades here?"

617
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 If a human was going

618
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 to implant false memories in somebody else,

619
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 you would go, "Oh, they're dry...

620
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 We'll have them driving down the road,

621
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 and then we'll make them remember taking a turn

622
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 off and going to the old place they used to make out,

623
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and they drive out there for a while, and they...

624
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 they make out or whatever, and then they come back.

625
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Apparently, I'm the pervert.

626
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I'm putting in perverted stuff.

627
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah." Then he was kissing his cat.

628
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 "Ooh, he loves it." They're like, "Jason,

629
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 quit putting in gross false memories."

630
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 My point is that a human

631
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 could come up with better ones, and alien would just be like,

632
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 "Oh, bunch of stuff,

633
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 a bunch of random stuff to keep you from getting

634
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 home. Here's your false memories."

635
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 With the two musicians,

636
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 they didn't necessarily have a false memory,

637
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 but they... actually,

638
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 that's the second part that makes it creepy.

639
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Both of these groups of people,

640
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 they were lured out of their houses.

641
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 The couple at home

642
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 going, "You know what? Let's go see a movie."

643
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And they drive to the...

644
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 They had no... who wants to see

645
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Deep Star 6 in the theater?

646
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Really. I don't know if that's exactly

647
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 what they saw, but the story

648
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 goes they were just standing there

649
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and they go, "Let's go see a movie."

650
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Like, it popped in both their head at the same time.

651
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 They drive out to watch the movie

652
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 when they go to go home. They're trapped.

653
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And then eventually they have

654
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 these memories of being abducted.

655
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 With these two young men,

656
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 they already saw Deep Star 6.

657
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 They don't care about that. What's going to get

658
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 two young dudes out of the apartment?

659
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 You could have had a bunch of curvy. You could have some gray aliens

660
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 wearing wigs and like tight dresses.

661
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. They're like, "Hey boys!"

662
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Or...

663
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Because I've done this. If there's a bunch

664
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 of cop cars flying by, I will

665
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 follow them. Not anymore, because I walk.

666
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But I used to have a car. I used to follow

667
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 cop cars all the time. I always used to...

668
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 police helicopters searching the area to go out to the area.

669
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Just hang out.

670
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 See what's going on.

671
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 With Sacramento too, so that happened a lot.

672
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But that's going to get you out of your house.

673
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 You see four military helicopters

674
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 escorting a UFO. That's way better than a police chase.

675
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You're going to go out there.

676
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And you have to think

677
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 they're seeing it.

678
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But this was never reported in the mainstream

679
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 media.

680
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 So that makes me think no one else

681
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 in the city is seeing this thing.

682
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It was unique to them.

683
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And it wanted to get them to a location

684
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 where it could abduct them.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So not only

686
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 is it possible that people are being abducted

687
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and never even

688
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 knowing about it.

689
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They're just that time you went for a walk.

690
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And it's not like you walked out

691
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 your house. The next thing you know

692
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 you were standing in the middle of Virginia

693
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 wearing a raincoat. You're like, "Well, what?"

694
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 You walk out of your house. You're walking down the street.

695
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You see a cat. You're like, "Oh, look at this.

696
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Cool little cat." You walk a couple more feet.

697
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You see a squirrel. You're like, "Oh, that's cool."

698
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Then you walk a few more feet and you see the squirrel

699
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 riding the cat.

700
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 What?

701
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And then you... that what?

702
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Did I just see that? And then you turn the corner

703
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 and you go back home.

704
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And in that time period

705
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 was basically an al...

706
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 you get abducted and an alien going,

707
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 "Well, we have to account for these 10 minutes

708
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 that we have this due."

709
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And cowboys ride horses

710
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 and squirrels look like cowboys

711
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 apparently to an alien.

712
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Let's make them ride a cat. That's normal, right?

713
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So you have to think

714
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 about all those times you've ever seen...

715
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 What if the actually seen a UFO

716
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 is the anomaly that's being put

717
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 in your brain? Everyone's being abducted.

718
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 But that's not

719
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 the only scary part about this, because I covered

720
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 that on a past episode. The scary part is

721
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 is that you can actually be taken out

722
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 of your safe space

723
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 by your own

724
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 "free will"

725
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 to get you in a better position to be abducted.

726
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Both of these stories involved people going to places

727
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 they wouldn't have been going at that moment.

728
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Both of them

729
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 either seeing something or sensing something

730
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 to get them to leave that place.

731
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That's scary.

732
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 That's scary. Because

733
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 it didn't seem weird to any of them.

734
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Well, the UFO flying over town was weird,

735
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 but their own instinct to follow it

736
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 was normal.

737
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 That's creepy. Because I think

738
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 the thing that we can count on is

739
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 if we're ever in a position

740
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 where our lives are in jeopardy,

741
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 we can make rational decisions.

742
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But what if that's simply not true?

743
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 What if you could be safe at your home

744
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 and then go,

745
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "You know what? I want ice cream."

746
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 "I have ice cream in my freezer,

747
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 but I want a particular type of ice cream

748
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and it's across town at this particular

749
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 ice cream shop."

750
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 You're driving over there,

751
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 you get abducted.

752
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Creepy.

753
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But then let's take it to 11.

754
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 The aliens

755
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 are ready to make their move.

756
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Whatever their overall goal is,

757
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 the aliens are ready

758
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 to make their move against humanity.

759
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 What will any of our technology matter?

760
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 What will any of our military matter?

761
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 If they can simply

762
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 trick us

763
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 into walking outside,

764
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 we may want

765
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 an Independence Day war with the aliens

766
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 to take our planet back,

767
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 but when the moment comes,

768
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 we may all just walk outside.

769
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Because that's what we want to do

770
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 in that moment.

771
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Or at least

772
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 that's what we think

773
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 we want to do.
