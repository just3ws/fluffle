1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
 A bizarre sighting in the middle of the woods.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,380
 A conspiracy that involves America's favorite pastime.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,680
 And then we take another trip to the conspiracy theory iceberg to look at the bizarre theory

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,080
 that demonic activity is closely connected to the blue light coming out of your cell

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
 phone.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
 [Music]

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
 We got three stories.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,720
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Swain on Discord.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 Swain on Discord.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,080
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
 Really really helps out a lot.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,200
 I want to say this about Swain real quick.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,320
 There's going to be a link in the show notes.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,360
 Today I'm putting it above even my Patreon link.

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,600
 I want everyone to check this out.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,680
 A long time ago, Swain took my Thomas Dick episode and made a proof of

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,040
 concept little animation of that episode.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,680
 It's maybe like 40 seconds, a minute long.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,200
 I think it's so funny.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,320
 Actually watching this video, watching this cartoon, made me realize how my style of presenting

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
 it was really kind of a wake up call.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,880
 It was kind of weird to see myself doing the show.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,080
 This was pretty early on.

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,360
 I think this was in the first hundred episodes.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
 It was really really cool.

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,480
 I'd been meaning to share it with you and then I forgot who sent it to me, honestly.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 I've lost the link.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,680
 But when he hit me up on the Patreon, I was able to track it down.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 So there it is.

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
 I recommend all you guys checking out his channel, checking out that video.

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
 It's super funny.

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,400
 It's a little animated version of that episode.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 Awesome.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
 Thank you so much Swain.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 Thank you so much for doing that.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,240
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,880
 Just help get the word out about the show.

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,960
 That really really helps out a lot guys.

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,880
 Swain, we're going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,560
 First off, we're headed out to the middle of the forest.

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,080
 [singing]

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
 We're getting married apparently.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 What's that song from?

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
 Some old timey thing.

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 It doesn't matter.

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,960
 Music box music.

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,680
 We get to the middle of the forest.

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,640
 Now this is totally unsourced.

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,440
 This was a post from the export that was screen-shotted and then presented on Reddit.

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,400
 So that's the providence of this story.

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 Or providence?

58
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
 It doesn't matter.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 Providence.

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
 This is the providence of this story.

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
 We don't have a source.

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
 We don't have a location.

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,480
 We don't have anything like that.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
 I still find this story interesting.

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 We're going to take a look.

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,680
 Okay, so slow down the car Swain.

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,440
 We're pulling up into the forest.

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
 Get out.

69
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
 We got on our hunting caps.

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 We got our rifles.

71
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
 We're walking around.

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,960
 And we're going to join a man hunting with his grandfather.

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
 What happened was there was a kid.

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 He was 19th birthday.

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
 He was out hunting with his grandpa.

76
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,320
 He was a little father, not father son by the name of the activity.

77
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,320
 Grandfather son by the name of the activity.

78
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
 No, whatever.

79
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,640
 Two dudes are hanging out in the woods, right?

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,240
 And they see a deer walking around.

81
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,720
 And this is what they came here for.

82
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,200
 This isn't that Rihanna song.

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
 This is what they actually came here for.

84
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
 They're going to kill this deer.

85
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 And the deer stops and looks at a rock and they get their guns ready.

86
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,640
 Do both of them shoot at the same time?

87
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,520
 I've never been hunting.

88
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,960
 Do you take turns hunting?

89
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
 Do I have it?

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
 And I'm like, okay, I'm going to shoot it in the neck this time.

91
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,880
 And you're like, no, you numbschool.

92
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
 I'm going to do it.

93
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
 You guys are wrestling over the gun.

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,240
 If there's two people with guns, do they take turns?

95
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
 Do they both shoot at the same time?

96
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,720
 Whichever bullet hits it first wins?

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
 Anyways, they're sitting there with their guns.

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 This is, I'm a city boy.

99
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,680
 They're sitting there with their guns.

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,960
 And they see this deer and the deer is like just standing there looking at this rock.

101
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:41,720
 And then slams its head into the rock and the grandpa and the son, the son's not there.

102
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,680
 The grandpa, the son realizes the disturbance.

103
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,560
 The grandfather and the grandson look at each other and they look back at the deer and

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,120
 this, the rock is covered in blood and the deer looks at the rock, smashes its head into

105
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,640
 the rock again, smashes its head into the rock again.

106
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,120
 One of the antlers break off.

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
 It's like 3D.

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,200
 It's coming right at the grandpa and the grandson.

109
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
 They dodge.

110
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,920
 Crash, crash, crash, smash in its head into the rock harder and harder and harder.

111
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,280
 The deer rears its head back up and brains are shooting out of the deer.

112
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 Swains thrown up in the corner.

113
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 Sorry, Swain.

114
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,780
 I'm holding his hair back.

115
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,780
 Smash.

116
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,080
 The deer keeps smashing its head into the rock.

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 Brains are just leaking out.

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,400
 And then the deer stands up on two legs, looks around, starts walking towards the river on

119
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,320
 two legs and then just doot, doot, doot, raging river.

120
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,880
 Doot, doot, doot, walking deeper into the water.

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
 Doot, doot, drowns.

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,520
 The grandpa and the grandson, the birthday party's canceled, right?

123
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,460
 Grandfather actually moved out of the area.

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,220
 He went to go live with his grandmother in Florida.

125
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
 Not his grandmother.

126
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,700
 She went to be like Betsy Ross.

127
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,260
 He goes to live with his wife in Florida.

128
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,860
 I don't know whether they separated before.

129
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,340
 He's like, "Honey, please take me back.

130
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,060
 I've seen the air of my ways.

131
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,900
 Plus, I've seen pure Cthulhu level horror.

132
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,340
 Please, I want another chance."

133
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,020
 He moves in with his ex-wife, his grandma.

134
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
 Not his grandma.

135
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
 What is up with him?

136
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,500
 Anyways, the point is that grandfather moves away and the grandson never leaves.

137
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,520
 He never went back to the forest.

138
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
 So that story was posted.

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 It's creepy, right?

140
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,820
 It's pretty disgusting.

141
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,160
 Some people have had, first off, let's assume the story's true.

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
 Could totally be fake.

143
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
 Could be creepy, boss.

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
 But let's assume for the sake of argument that it's true.

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,240
 Some people on Reddit go, "It could be chronic wasting disease.

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,520
 It could have had like Khrushvill's Jokkup disease.

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,400
 It's the Mad Cow disease, but it's the deer version, Mad Deer disease."

148
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,120
 It could have been that they had like some sort of obviously mental deficiency and smashed

149
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
 their brains.

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,980
 Like they were having some sort of disease that was eating away at their brain.

151
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,220
 And the itch was so bad that they were smashing their head into the rock.

152
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,420
 It doesn't explain why they walked up on two feet.

153
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,220
 I guess deer sometimes can walk on two feet, not for a super long distance, but they have

154
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
 been known to do that.

155
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,060
 There's video footage of them walking like that.

156
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,900
 But yeah, a bizarre story.

157
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,100
 I mean, obviously I'm covering it not just because it's bizarre, but because it's almost

158
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,460
 like, it is like a Cthulhu level thing.

159
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,820
 Like an animal killing itself.

160
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
 Very calmly.

161
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,000
 Like it was smashing its head, but it wasn't crying out in pain.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
 And then once it had already knocked out a good chunk of its brains, it stood up and

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 walked away into the river.

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
 Now, that obviously sounds fake.

165
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,400
 Another person on Reddit was saying they worked at a farm.

166
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
 Oh, by the way, if you love animals, rewind it.

167
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,320
 Don't listen to this first story.

168
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,240
 But sorry, I should have said that earlier.

169
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,920
 This one guy said he was working on a farm in Australia and there was massive wildfire.

170
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,480
 And he remembers seeing kangaroos that had been caught on fire running towards their fence

171
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
 line.

172
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
 Around their property.

173
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,860
 And he says the kangaroos were burning.

174
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,180
 They were on fire.

175
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,180
 They're killing themselves.

176
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,460
 They've been smashing their heads into the metal fence line to kill the pain was so

177
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,220
 unbearable.

178
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,180
 Which is interesting because I didn't know animals were that smart.

179
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,860
 Like I didn't think an animal was smart enough to kill itself.

180
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
 Like yeah, sure, lemmings.

181
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,860
 You know that's not true.

182
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,140
 You know lemmings don't really run off cliffs.

183
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
 That's a weird thing.

184
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,140
 Walt Disney's, that was from a documentary that Walt Disney made.

185
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,120
 And they're like, I don't know if they just needed a climatic ending or something like

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
 that.

187
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 I guess the lemmings kind of do that.

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,800
 But they, the producers of that documentary pushed them off.

189
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,320
 They weren't like, wasn't like off screen.

190
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,880
 There was a intern like throwing them off the cliff.

191
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,080
 But they edited the footage and made basically like herded them off the cliff.

192
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,400
 I think it is a real thing, but not to the scale that it really is.

193
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,520
 And then that movie was a meme that made it a thing.

194
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,920
 But anyways, like how does a kangaroo, so you're on fire.

195
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,780
 This is super grim, but let's say I'm a kangaroo and I'm smoldering.

196
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,020
 Not like I'm super sexy.

197
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 I'm literally smoky.

198
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,900
 And I see a pillow, a metal stake, and a tree.

199
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,540
 And I have to smash my head into one of those three things.

200
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,340
 I didn't think animals were smart enough to go pillow or stick a nap.

201
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,780
 The metal stake will go through my brain and that tree will take a long time for me to

202
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
 smash my head.

203
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,540
 Because they don't know what metal is.

204
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,320
 I didn't know that animals knew the difference between like minerals and stuff.

205
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,040
 Like I didn't know, like if you put a kangaroo and you had like, let's say you had a cliff.

206
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,480
 You were like, Jason, please, please, just stop talking about it.

207
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,880
 You had a cliff and there was like a bunch of water at the bottom of one cliff and then

208
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,360
 a bunch of water and some giant rocks on another cliff.

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 Swain's like, give me my money back.

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,560
 Why am I here for this episode?

211
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,000
 He's erasing the cartoon.

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360
 He deletes it from YouTube.

213
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 You have a cliff.

214
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
 You have a water.

215
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
 You have a cliff.

216
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,540
 You have water with jagged rocks.

217
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,260
 And then you have a cliff with like a pavement underneath it.

218
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,180
 Would the kangaroo go to the first cliff and go, mm-mm, that's just water.

219
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,420
 I'll probably swim.

220
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,380
 But it will put the fire out.

221
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,260
 And then he jumps to the other one, but he still wants to kill himself because he owes

222
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,220
 the mob a bunch of money and he can't pay him back and he's on fire.

223
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,140
 So he goes to the other cliff and he sees the jagged rocks and he goes, hmm, that will

224
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,660
 kill me, but maybe not.

225
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,940
 Maybe I'll fall in between the jagged rocks and dive very slowly.

226
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,200
 And then he goes to the other cliff and sees the pavement and goes, that is pavement.

227
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,400
 In my kangaroo brain, it knows that that will kill me instantly because the reason

228
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,320
 I know that if I jump off a cliff and if I land on pavement, I will die is because people

229
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,080
 have told me that.

230
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,600
 I don't genetically know.

231
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
 I never genetically knew that.

232
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,840
 You didn't know that.

233
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,760
 We don't know that if you fall off a distance, you die unless somebody tells you or you see

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
 it happen.

235
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,220
 If I, kangaroos aren't walking around with watermelons and they don't butterfingers in,

236
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,540
 they're like, whoops.

237
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,560
 And they watch the watermelon splat on the ground and the kangaroo goes, that will happen

238
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 to me.

239
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,500
 If I fall, that's not how animals think, right?

240
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,980
 So how did the animals know?

241
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,820
 Why wasn't the deer smashing his head on a tree?

242
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,700
 How did he know a rock was going to do the job?

243
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,860
 Like how did they figure that out?

244
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,180
 So anyways, the kangaroos impale themselves on metal spikes, which to me makes me think

245
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,360
 that they know minerals and stuff.

246
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,960
 Because then they'd be like, that's like soft soap rock.

247
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,240
 What's that rock that's like pumice, the kangaroo's on fire.

248
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
 You see he's a bunch of pumice.

249
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
 You guys get it.

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
 I'm not going to keep naming.

251
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
 I'm not going to keep coming with hypothetical situations.

252
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,040
 How does the kangaroo know that the metal would do it?

253
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
 Like did they jump past another fence?

254
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,840
 Then it was just like wood and the kangaroos are like, sure, I'm burning to death, but

255
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 that won't do the job.

256
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,800
 I know another 50 feet, there's a metal fence line.

257
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,860
 So there you go.

258
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,660
 I did not intend for that to be another evolutionary rant, but it turned out to be one.

259
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,860
 Swain, let's go ahead and leave behind Australia.

260
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,060
 That's where we ended up in that story.

261
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,580
 Let's hop in the Carbindercopter.

262
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,300
 We're headed back to America.

263
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500
 This is a really short one.

264
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,100
 I've had this on deck for a while.

265
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,220
 That was very interesting because I talk a lot about real conspiracies, conspiracies

266
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,300
 that are provable that matter.

267
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,820
 And this conspiracy, you can argue whether or not it matters.

268
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,300
 I think it matters to a large group of people though.

269
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,160
 And I got to give a shout out to Chris Thompson for Dead Spin, the website Dead Spin.

270
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,120
 He wrote this article a while back in July of 2019, and all of my research comes from

271
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
 this article.

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,680
 To give you a little background of the story, you have Major League Baseball, MLB.

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,960
 Recently back in 2019, had purchased Rawlings, and they're the ones who make the baseballs

274
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,560
 that are used in professional level baseball games.

275
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,920
 So originally they are two separate companies, but now Major League Baseball bought out

276
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,720
 Rawlings.

277
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,380
 And then we have this quote from Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander.

278
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,680
 He was speaking to ESPN, and he had this quote, and he's going to be referencing a man named

279
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,980
 Rob Manfred.

280
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,700
 He's the Major League Baseball Commissioner.

281
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,060
 So that's a little bit of background to this.

282
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,140
 I think this is an interesting conspiracy.

283
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:55,460
 And so what Verlander's beef is, is he believes that Major League Baseball is messing with

284
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,340
 the baseballs themselves.

285
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,540
 Because now they own the company that manufactures the baseball.

286
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,320
 He believes that Major League Baseball is actually gooseing up the balls.

287
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
 They're making it so they can just hit Homer after Homer after Homer.

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Look at this quote.

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I found this interesting.

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,040
 It's an effing joke, Verlander says.

291
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,480
 It's an effing joke.

292
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
 Major League Baseball is turning this game into a joke.

293
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,400
 They own Rawlings.

294
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,360
 And you've got Manfred up here saying it might be the way they center the pill.

295
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
 Some baseball term, I don't know what that means.

296
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,840
 But you might.

297
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
 Back to the quote.

298
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960
 They own the effing company.

299
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,460
 If any other 40 billion company bought out a 400 million company and the product changed

300
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,820
 dramatically, it's not a guess as to what happened.

301
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,620
 We all know what happened.

302
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,620
 Manfred the first time he came in, what did he say?

303
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,620
 He said they want more offense.

304
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,420
 All of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced.

305
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,460
 It's not a coincidence.

306
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,820
 We are not idiots.

307
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,460
 Then they're asking him, do you think that this is intentional?

308
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,940
 Do you think that these balls are making it easier to hit home runs?

309
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,460
 He goes into this quote.

310
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
 100%.

311
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,360
 They've been using juiced balls in the home run derby forever.

312
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 They know how to do it.

313
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 It's not coincidence.

314
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,640
 I find it really hard to believe that Major League Baseball owns Rawlings and just coincidentally,

315
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,120
 the balls become juiced.

316
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,560
 Manfred had a response to this and he simply said the balls have not been changed in quote

317
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
 any meaningful way, unquote.

318
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,960
 So the balls have been changed.

319
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,400
 I think that's an interesting conspiracy theory.

320
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,260
 It's one that affects millions of people, baseball fans.

321
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,220
 It definitely also affects money.

322
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,260
 So it's an interesting conspiracy theory.

323
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,500
 It's one that is probably true.

324
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,020
 It's one that involves a corporation manipulating the outcome behind the scenes.

325
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,100
 It really has all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

326
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,820
 You have a truth sayer who's putting his career on the line.

327
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,500
 I'm sure that he got, I'm sure his coaches got several phone calls after this interview.

328
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,420
 I'm sure he got pulled in his coach's office and all this stuff.

329
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,040
 It's all the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory.

330
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 I find this type of stuff very fascinating.

331
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,240
 It's a reminder that there are conspiracy theories happening all around us.

332
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
 They're like miracles.

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,640
 They happen all around and we don't know how they work, but they happen.

334
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,040
 Very very fascinating story.

335
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
 I don't really cover many sports on this show, but I thought that was an interesting one.

336
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,880
 So Swain, let's hop in that carbonar copter one last time this episode.

337
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,560
 We're headed out to Britain to start this adventure.

338
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,320
 We're flying out of Houston, Texas.

339
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,860
 Probably we'll cover this in a later episode, but supposedly there's supposed to be a massive

340
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,300
 hurricane hitting Houston, Texas on August 10th, I think it was.

341
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
 We'll be covering that.

342
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,780
 It's possible that a time traveler is using TikTok to warn people of the future.

343
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,740
 However, he's also selling t-shirts, so I'm a little skeptical of his time travel claims.

344
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,940
 But Beatrice Leyva sent me that story.

345
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,340
 We'll be talking about that later in the week.

346
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,980
 That's a little teaser for that.

347
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
 We're leaving behind.

348
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,980
 Beatrice is like, "No, no!

349
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
 The hurricane's coming!

350
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,980
 Save me!

351
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,980
 Save me!

352
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
 I'm a carbonar copter!

353
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
 We can totally hear her.

354
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
 We're just leaving her behind.

355
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
 Wait, no!

356
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
 I'm a loyal listener!"

357
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
 We're flying away.

358
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,440
 So, she's a loyal listener, but we're still leaving her to the hurricane that won't happen.

359
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
 But we're flying out.

360
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,480
 We're flying out to Britain.

361
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,820
 So this is from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

362
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,080
 It's just a simple phrase on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

363
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,560
 And again, thank you, Sam Weirdo from Twitter, aka Jack, for making this conspiracy theory

364
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
 iceberg.

365
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
 Spreadsheet has really made a lot of this stuff helpful to look at.

366
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,300
 We're flying to Britain because there's a conspiracy theory iceberg phrase, "LED attracts

367
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 demons."

368
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,220
 And that means light emitting diodes.

369
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,500
 So we're talking about all sorts of LED lights, which includes flat screen television sets,

370
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,540
 which will include your cell phone, includes computer monitors, which includes devices

371
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
 all over us.

372
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,900
 Now, these things invite demonic activity.

373
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,380
 So before we get into this, we're going to go to Britain.

374
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,740
 We're going to travel back to the year 1907.

375
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,120
 And LED light has an interesting provenance of different things.

376
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
 I see I learned.

377
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
 I learned.

378
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
 I learned from my mistakes.

379
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,840
 When it was basically invented and then forgotten and invented and forgotten.

380
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,740
 But it was originally first invented in the year 1907.

381
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,040
 That's the first time that you're able to create a solid state light, which is different

382
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,240
 than gas light or filament lights.

383
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,280
 Now back in 1907, this is like people are still walking around in old time Victorian

384
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
 clothing.

385
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
 The iPods haven't even shown up yet.

386
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,280
 So we're talking about like old timey stuff, but they were still working on a solid state

387
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 light.

388
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 And now it's everywhere.

389
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,180
 But you know, like it was invented and lost, invented and lost.

390
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,180
 1907.

391
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,680
 Guess who invented it?

392
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
 Marconi Labs.

393
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,920
 Now I don't know if that's the same Marconi related to Marconi systems that we covered

394
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,920
 on Friday that a bunch of people were brutally suicided.

395
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,040
 A little weird coincidence, right?

396
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,560
 I don't know how many Marconi labs are out there, but maybe it's different.

397
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,040
 Maybe it's the same people.

398
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,600
 It wouldn't make sense though, because Marconi was pushing the limits of science even in

399
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
 the 80s.

400
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,920
 But LED lights are all around us.

401
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,960
 It's very, very efficient.

402
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
 They don't use a lot of energy.

403
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
 They don't put out a lot of heat.

404
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,860
 The problem is that they're very, very damaging to our eyes, but it allows us to have flat

405
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
 screens.

406
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,880
 It allows us to have super bright cell phones and all that stuff.

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 So pick your poison.

408
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,480
 It could cause permanent eye damage.

409
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 We don't know yet.

410
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,000
 But let's take a look at this phrase here.

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 "LED attracts demons."

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,880
 The LED attracts demonic activity.

413
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,640
 It's kind of a spooky phrase, because I know that I personally stay up late in bed with

414
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,560
 my cell phone reading nonsense.

415
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,800
 And the light is comforting, right?

416
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
 You're in a dark room.

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
 You have that light.

418
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
 You feel safe.

419
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,320
 But what if the light is actually attracting the darkness?

420
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,480
 What if right now while you're lying in bed listening to this podcast and your phone's

421
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,680
 off in the corner giving you a little bit of blue light?

422
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,360
 What if that's not a safety net?

423
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,240
 What if it's actually a beacon for dark forces?

424
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,800
 I think it's interesting on one level, because light is always, light is the opposite of

425
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,680
 darkness.

426
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,040
 The Book of Genesis starts off where there is nothing but darkness.

427
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,640
 And then God says, "Let there be light."

428
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,800
 And that's like the creation.

429
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,320
 There was nothingness, and then light is the first thing created.

430
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,840
 That's if you believe in the story of Genesis, but even if you don't, I think you still get

431
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 the symbolism.

432
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,120
 Even if you look at the Book of Genesis as a myth, you still understand the symbolism.

433
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
 It's light coming into darkness.

434
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
 It's something coming into nothing.

435
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,600
 I think when we think of light, we also think of the heat, of the warmth.

436
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,760
 And even a light bulb, an old light bulb, an old filament light bulb, was hot to the

437
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,680
 touch so you couldn't have light without other forms of energy, i.e. heat.

438
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,320
 So what if you're able to have light but you're able to not have the heat?

439
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,960
 Which is what an LED does, or it has such an insignificant amount of heat.

440
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,880
 What if it's not the light that actually keeps the darkness away, but the heat that does.

441
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,040
 It's not the light of day that keeps demonic forces at bay.

442
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
 It's the heat of the life-giving sun.

443
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,160
 It's the oil lamp.

444
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 It's the candle.

445
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
 It's the flame.

446
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,760
 Even if it's just the flame being put out by a filament, we were confused.

447
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,680
 It wasn't the light itself but the heat behind the light.

448
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,640
 Now that we've been able to create a world of light with no heat, we've basically taken

449
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,000
 that natural defense away.

450
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,880
 So we are in the darkness, even though there's light.

451
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
 We're still surrounded by darkness.

452
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,960
 So when you're already in a dark room and you pull out your cell phone late at night, that

453
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,440
 blue screen pops up.

454
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,400
 Something knows that you are not protected.

455
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,740
 It knows where you're at.

456
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,400
 And it knows that the heat, the life-giving energy, is gone.

457
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,280
 Replaced with a false light.

458
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,560
 Lucifer is described as, Lucifer literally means "lightbringer."

459
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,720
 But is it a false light?

460
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 That was always the thing.

461
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,040
 Lucifer brings false light.

462
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 Very very esoteric.

463
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,680
 I mean, obviously this is what we do with the conspiracy theory icebergs.

464
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,520
 We take these phrases.

465
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,080
 We examine whether or not there's any truth to the phrase.

466
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,220
 We put on our conspiracy caps, full board.

467
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,060
 We discuss this.

468
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,460
 So that's one saying of it could have a literal meaning like that.

469
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,020
 That having LED lights attract demons because it is a false light.

470
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,300
 We think we're safe but we're not.

471
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
 We're the opposite of safe.

472
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
 We're sending out a beacon.

473
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
 I mean, that's always the thing.

474
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,340
 When you cry for help, you could be attracting a savior or you could be attracting a predator,

475
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,180
 knowing that you're unsafe.

476
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,620
 You're scared.

477
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,180
 So let's flip this around for a second.

478
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,680
 Maybe the blue screen isn't attracting them to us in the external world.

479
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,320
 Maybe the demons have already infested cyberspace.

480
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,160
 They're already existing in this virtual world.

481
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,720
 And when we pull out our film late at night, turn it on and begin surfing the internet,

482
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
 as your kids call it.

483
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,400
 They find their way from the virtual world into our world.

484
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,960
 That's interesting theory.

485
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 Let's take a look at this.

486
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,840
 You'll see this if you look this up.

487
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,120
 So I have to address this.

488
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
 Here's a man.

489
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,380
 He's the Reverend Jim Pease-- I have to give him his due.

490
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,740
 He's a man of the cloth.

491
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,180
 A Reverend Jim Peaseboro.

492
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,820
 He wrote a book called Devil and the Machine.

493
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,020
 He's a minister down in Georgia and he was interviewed in this newspaper.

494
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,980
 You'll see his name pop up on a ton of very reputable paranormal websites.

495
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,860
 He wrote a book called Ghosts in the Machine about how demons can possess computers.

496
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,100
 He doesn't exist.

497
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,180
 He was originally mentioned in the Weekly World News.

498
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
 The book doesn't exist.

499
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
 He doesn't exist.

500
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,260
 So if you start researching this and he pops up, immediately just move on to the next article

501
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,360
 because that doesn't exist.

502
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,720
 What does exist-- so I had to address that because he's the most popular-- what does

503
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 exist though is there is a man named Rizwan Horshee and he wrote two books.

504
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,240
 They're both called Seeing Controlled Demons and Pains from my eyes, a Sense and Theories.

505
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,280
 And then he had book one and book two.

506
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,920
 He had an interesting-- I haven't ordered the books.

507
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,800
 I was just reading the excerpts and they have the Google x-ray thing.

508
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,840
 But I think I got the gist of it.

509
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,020
 He has this theory that demons do possess computers.

510
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,700
 He actually believes that there is a separate type of demon that is what's known as an

511
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,900
 electronic demon.

512
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,340
 And he says they're brain-- they're basically completely digital, but not digital in the

513
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,660
 sense that they're ones and zeros.

514
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,540
 Like, they don't exist-- they exist in an electronic form.

515
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,740
 Their bodies are electric.

516
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,220
 Their brains are electric.

517
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,360
 They are a completely different strata of demons.

518
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,880
 And these demons use the electrical impulses of our brains to hack us.

519
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 Now, this obviously sounds completely bizarre, right?

520
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,280
 But let's again put on our conspiracy caps that also protect our brains from being hacked.

521
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,340
 The idea of a spiritual possession is a demon taking over your body.

522
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,880
 Your soul is trapped in your own body.

523
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,800
 So you can kind of observe what's going on, but the demon has control over your body.

524
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:00,140
 If you had to explain hacking to a caveman, that is pretty much what you would say, right?

525
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,620
 That your computer is being controlled by somebody else.

526
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,860
 Now obviously it gets more complicated than that.

527
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,540
 You could say, well, your computer is not controlled.

528
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,720
 It's this particular subset program that's running, and it's overriding this program

529
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,220
 that should be doing it, and so on and so forth.

530
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,620
 It has back-- you can go into the real technical side of it.

531
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,040
 You will just say, the hacker has control of your computer.

532
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,740
 You talk to a computer specialist, they'll be like, well, they have control of this particular

533
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,000
 thing and this pathway and stuff like that.

534
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,280
 So the idea of a demon not necessarily having a soul possession, but simply hacking into

535
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,200
 your brain-- your brain is nothing but electrical impulses and gray matter.

536
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,120
 And so the idea that something could interfere with the electrical impulses would make sense.

537
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,580
 And how do most people get hacked?

538
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,740
 Not all, but most people get hacked by messing up themselves, by inviting something into

539
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,260
 their computer.

540
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:59,060
 Opening an email, clicking on a link, winning a sweepstakes and following the prompts.

541
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,340
 That's how a lot of computers get hacked.

542
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,140
 It's rare that you just turn on your computer.

543
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,540
 If it possible, I'm sure it's possible, but it would have to be a specialized attack where

544
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,120
 you turn on your computer, you do nothing and it gets hacked.

545
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,820
 And so what do we always hear about people getting possessed?

546
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,380
 They invite the spirits in.

547
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,540
 They're using the Ouija board.

548
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,060
 They're going to these haunted locations.

549
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,540
 They're putting themselves at risk of being possessed, i.e. hacked.

550
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:32,900
 So it's less paranormal and more like a new program overriding the brain.

551
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,640
 And because these demons exist in an electronic form or an electrical form, they can move

552
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,980
 through the internet.

553
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,280
 So it's not like you're pulling your cell phone up late at night and there's a demon

554
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:53,040
 out in a graveyard somewhere flying through the sky and it's sitting outside your window.

555
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
 It's the other side.

556
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,240
 It's in the system already and you're going through the internet and you're seeing a link

557
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,920
 and you're clicking on it and something in the system sees you.

558
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,400
 That blue light to us is a display, but it's really a one-way mirror.

559
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,300
 On the other side of that screen of that big screen television set of your laptop of your

560
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,260
 phone there's something watching you, influencing you, hacking you.

561
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,180
 I find this theory very, very fascinating.

562
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
 Very fascinating.

563
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,700
 I believe that there's another phrase on the conspiracy theory iceberg that I've tried

564
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
 looking into.

565
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,700
 I haven't really found much on it.

566
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,820
 It's enchanted websites.

567
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,460
 I believe, and I mentioned this before on the show, I believe that websites can be haunted.

568
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,480
 I 100% believe that if a location can be haunted what is a website but a digital place?

569
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,160
 We even use terms like digital storefront.

570
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,000
 Why couldn't there be haunted websites?

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,520
 Haunted porn websites that make you seek out more extreme pornography until the next

572
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 thing you know.

573
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,120
 The feds are kicking in your door.

574
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,760
 You just went too far.

575
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,800
 You couldn't get that feeling again.

576
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,600
 It was addicted.

577
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,540
 A haunted gambling website into blowing your family's fortunes.

578
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,900
 There was a guy recently who met a cam girl in Russia.

579
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:18,860
 He embezzled $250,000 from his father and when his family finally had an intervention

580
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,060
 for him he killed his brother, his mother, and his father.

581
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,420
 He's in prison now for the rest of his life for a cam girl.

582
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,660
 I'm not saying the cam girl is a demon but I'm saying that you can't tell me there's

583
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,840
 not demonic influences on the internet.

584
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,960
 You find a gore website and then you're trying to find even gore your things and then you

585
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,520
 want to try it out for yourself.

586
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,680
 Now millions of people could go and watch gore videos all day long but you went to that

587
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,560
 site that had another force behind it.

588
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,480
 You went to that site and something reached out and interfered with the electrical waves

589
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,520
 of your brain.

590
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,860
 You didn't even notice it but you knew you needed to go back to that site.

591
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,820
 Maybe you were at work the next day and you felt, "I need to go see if they've updated

592
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
 that.

593
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,420
 I want to see what that's new going on.

594
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,060
 I want to see this and you keep going to it."

595
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,860
 Over and over and over again you're building those neural pathways.

596
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,900
 You're opening the door to this thing.

597
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:26,580
 Riz Juan also says that based on his theory we should never build robots with the capability

598
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,960
 of killing humans because guess what?

599
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,780
 These electronic demons can possess the body of a robot.

600
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,800
 So it may not be that we have to worry about the AI overlord or maybe a demon will masquerade

601
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,680
 as an AI.

602
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,440
 Humanity will think they've created this amazing advanced intelligence system but it's really

603
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,440
 an age old demonic force.

604
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,920
 The darkness itself that was pushed away when the light came into existence.

605
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,980
 Living in a computer.

606
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,260
 Leading humanity.

607
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,980
 And what does LED stand for?

608
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,620
 Light emitting diode.

609
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,380
 What is it's spell?

610
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,100
 Lead.

611
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,180
 Causing a person to move in a direction.

612
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,180
 Now I've made fun of other people who've made such connections in the past and feel free

613
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,140
 to make fun of me but I do find that to be an interesting coincidence.

614
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,340
 Is it possible that these devices we have in our pockets that we use for entertainment

615
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:28,200
 that you're probably listening to this podcast on this very moment is actually a beacon

616
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,860
 that brings us every time we use it one step closer to the darkness.

617
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:40,640
 We think it connects us as a civilization and it does but it may be connecting the civilization

618
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,040
 to something much darker, much older and much more evil than we could ever comprehend.

619
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,260
