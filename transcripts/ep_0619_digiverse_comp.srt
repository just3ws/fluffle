1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 When human remains are found in a California desert,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,900
 authorities have to ask themselves,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,900
 "Is this an accident? Is this murder?"

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,900
 or something far more vicious.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,400
 And then we travel back in time to the year 2008,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,700
 when hundreds of people looked to the sky and waited for the Digi Clips.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,400
 Was there really a plan to open the portal between our world

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,100
 and an old Japanese cartoon today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,800
 [music]

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. The pig wrestling went fine.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,700
 Lil' Piggy got her hooves clipped.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,300
 I got a little injured, pulled some muscles in my shoulders,

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,800
 but everything else is fine.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,900
 If you're a new listener to this podcast, that may no sense,

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,300
 but to you returning listeners, I am healthy.

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,800
 Also, I got the test results back for my heart.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,900
 Totally healthy, totally fine.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,700
 Two weeks of observation with a little heart monitor.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,300
 Everything was absolutely fine.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,000
 I just used too much nicotine, too much caffeine,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
 and threw my heart for a loop.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,800
 So great news all around.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
 Piggy got her hooves clipped and my heart's fine.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,100
 I mean, what more could you ask for a way to start a podcast?

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,600
 There's one more thing.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,300
 Another great thing about this is introducing our newest Patreon supporter,

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,600
 writing in on a floating heart, because it's Valentine's Day, actually.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,500
 He's dressed up in a little Cupid's outfit. It's Mike Knoap.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,400
 Everyone give a round of applause to Mike Knoap.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 He's wearing a diaper.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
 He has the little arrow thing,

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,800
 and he's floating around on a human heart, an anatomically correct human heart.

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,600
 Mike, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,200
 If you can't support the Patreon and you're not a Greek god of love, that's okay.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,700
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,100
 So Mike, you can keep on your Cupid outfit.

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
 You look adorable, but I am going to tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,300
 Get off that heart.

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,100
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,500
 We are headed out to San Bernardino County.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,100
 Jason Jalopy is driving down the freeway now.

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,000
 This story, man, I zeroed in on this story.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,500
 I swear the second it was published,

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,800
 my spidey senses popped off.

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,400
 The ones and zeros weren't even fully formed in the matrix before I was reading this article.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,000
 However, I also got a request to do this one as well.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,200
 Longtime fan of the show, Stuart Meatball, YouTube champion Stuart Meatball,

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
 hit me up and goes, "Hey, man, have you read this article?"

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
 And the answer was, "I had."

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,500
 It's San Bernardino County, California.

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 January 31st, 2021.

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,400
 We're standing out in the desert.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 Wind sweeping the ground.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,500
 We see a sheriff's department truck there and a bunch of cops are walking around.

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,400
 They're all dusty and stuff like that.

59
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
 They don't take baths.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,800
 You didn't know that?

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,700
 Cops down there, they never take baths.

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:09,600
 So they see like bones and a skull and there's like an evil vulture.

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,000
 I don't know.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,700
 Maybe it's just a good vulture, but it just happens to eat humans.

65
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's sitting there as well.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,900
 They're taking pictures.

67
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,600
 Ka-klick-jj.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
 Ka-klick-jjj.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 Because they have an old camera.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,700
 Apparently they have the camera from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre opening credits.

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,900
 They're specifically in Wonder Valley, which is next to Joshua Tree National Park here in San Bernardino County, California.

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,000
 Now, at this point, the remains have not been identified.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
 These human remains have just been found.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,900
 Let's go back in time to June 2020, though.

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,500
 There's people who think they know who this body may belong to.

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,700
 June 2020, there was a woman named Erica Lloyd.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
 She was doing a solo trip.

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,400
 She wanted to drive to Joshua Tree National Park, but they lost track of her.

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
 She never came home.

80
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,300
 She's been missing since June 2020.

81
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,800
 The authorities did find her car abandoned and it was vandalized.

82
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,300
 Now, the fact that she's missing, the fact that it's vandalized could be totally two separate events.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,500
 People could have just seen the car out there and decided, you know, this is a good target.

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:13,000
 However, this is why you shouldn't just be a once in vandal because I'm sure that those vandals are actually being looked for by the police.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,700
 They're all, "Mikey was here!"

86
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 And they're like, "Find all Mikeys!

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,000
 Find all the Mikeys in San Bernardino, California.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,900
 Don't vandalize stuff because you might become a murder suspect."

89
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,600
 That's tip one from a veteran vandal.

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,100
 Around the same time, in the same area, there was a dude he'd bought a motel, an old rundown motel, and he wanted to rebuild it.

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,400
 It would be a project for him, maybe turn it into a tourist attraction.

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
 He was kind of a wealthy guy, but, you know, it gets you to use your hands.

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,100
 He gets to like actually create things and craft things.

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,700
 Plus, it's a business investment.

95
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,100
 It's old. I don't know if he's old.

96
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,100
 This man buys this hotel and he's repairing it and he asked his buddy, "Hey, you want to come out?

97
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,300
 You're not working right now. The pandemic's going on. Everything's shut down.

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,000
 Why don't you come out and help me rebuild this motel in the middle of nowhere?"

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,100
 It's in Wonder Valley, right near Joshua Tree National Park.

100
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:13,000
 So a man gets in his car and drives from his home in Hollywood in June 2020 to go work with his friend at this hotel.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
 He pulls up outside the hotel.

102
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,700
 It's just him and his buddy there in the middle of nowhere.

103
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,500
 Somewhere nearby, Erika Lloyd is also driving to an unknown destination.

104
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,000
 But this man who gets out of his car, this man who was invited by his friend to be in the middle of nowhere to build this hotel...

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,200
 [Sigh]

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,600
 His name is Armie Hammer.

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,900
 Now, if you're new, if you're new listener to the show, welcome.

108
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,000
 We've been talking about Armie Hammer a lot in the past couple weeks.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,500
 This is a true story.

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,100
 Armie Hammer's been in the news.

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,800
 I've talked about him a couple of times on the show.

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,700
 I've made several jokes about him.

113
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,800
 He's to wrap it up real quick.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,500
 To wrap it up like a piece of meat.

115
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,600
 Armie Hammer allegedly, he denies it, but was sending messages saying how much he wanted to eat women.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,300
 How he wanted to break their ribs and eat them.

117
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,800
 How he wanted to cut off their toes and keep them in their pocket.

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,500
 And he declared himself in one of these texts, "I am 100% accountable."

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
 There's no wiggle room there.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,700
 Unless you're talking about the fingers wiggling off of a newly severed hand.

121
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,500
 That guy, that was just dark.

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,400
 That was disturbing.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,600
 But anyways, that's what Armie Hammer calls Top Ramen.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,100
 The point is, is that he's talking all this stuff about wanting to eat people.

125
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,000
 He denies it.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,500
 There's all these allegations of people saying he's having all these women come forward and saying,

127
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,900
 "We all got messages saying he wanted to eat me."

128
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,000
 Now, what happened was last summer, he was texting from this hotel.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
 "Hey guys, isn't this so awesome?

130
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
 I'm out here in the middle of nowhere.

131
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,100
 You can run, you can hide, but you can scream all you want.

132
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,300
 But I'll still build this hotel."

133
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,300
 And people are like, "What?

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,500
 That's weird why he had that medicine part."

135
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,900
 He was texting, he was posting on Instagram that he was out in Joshua Tree, out in Wonder Valley,

136
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,700
 rebuilding this hotel with his buddy.

137
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
 And people are like, "Oh, you know, he doesn't have anything else to do.

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
 The pandemic's going on.

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,700
 All the movies are closed down.

140
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,100
 Who doesn't like spending time in the outdoors building stuff?"

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 Now, this woman, these human remains have been found.

142
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,900
 The question is, is it Erica Lloyd?

143
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
 Is it somebody else?

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,900
 There are some news reports saying there are three sets of human remains found.

145
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,500
 Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

146
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,800
 That wouldn't make sense.

147
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,000
 But I've only seen that reported in the gossip sites.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,300
 The actual news sites say one set of human remains have been found in an area where Army Hammer was working,

149
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,200
 i.e. in the area in the middle of nowhere.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,800
 It would be like if there were human remains found in downtown Los Angeles, that's Wednesday.

151
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,700
 The garbage men are just like, "Oh, they put on their corner cap and they're already dissecting it."

152
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
 And Army Hammer's just walking on the street.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,900
 You wouldn't even think about it.

154
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,100
 But the fact that Army Hammer is in the desert, Army Hammer is in the desert,

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
 and now we're finding human remains in the desert, and it may have been this woman.

156
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,500
 Absolutely insane.

157
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,100
 I woke up, I saw this story.

158
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,900
 I was like, "This is... I have to talk about this."

159
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
 But what happened was, I had actually, this story is a couple of days old.

160
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,800
 I had already recorded those episodes because I had to go wrestle that pig.

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
 So I had to wait.

162
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,900
 I had to wait to tell the story.

163
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,800
 And then Stuart's like, "Hey, did you read this?"

164
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
 And I was like, "Dude, yes."

165
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,100
 I also, and this is funny because I've been discussing this story with people in my private life as well.

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 I think the Army Hammer saga, I had never thought it would get to the point where he's a suspect in a murder.

167
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:39,900
 To be fair, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office have said he is not a suspect in the murder.

168
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,100
 Which is exactly what you would say to a man who has millions of dollars and can fly to Thailand.

169
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,900
 He would just fly away.

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,200
 So of course, the Sheriff's like, "Shh."

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,900
 She's like holding his finger to his lips.

172
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
 "No, he's not a suspect."

173
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,400
 And then they're like, "Getting cuffs ready.

174
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,000
 They're getting Army Hammer-sized cuffs ready."

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,900
 So they're officially saying he's not a suspect, but that's a little premature.

176
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:09,100
 There's human remains found in the location of a man once again who declared himself 100% accountable.

177
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,200
 He denies it, so he denies it, but his Instagram said it, right?

178
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,800
 His Instagram said it, and a bunch of his exes have come forward and said,

179
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,100
 "Yeah, he was kind of about eating people and stuff like that."

180
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,900
 Two more things.

181
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,400
 One, he did a movie called "Call Me By Your Name."

182
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
 No, that's not it.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
 He's like, "Hey, my name's Timmy.

184
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,500
 Hey, Timmy, come back here."

185
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,300
 That'd be confusing.

186
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,200
 "Call Me By Your Name."

187
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,100
 Wait, no, what?

188
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,700
 "Call Me By My Name."

189
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,200
 It was a romance, I guess. I never saw it, but it was him and Timothy Chalmet.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,700
 It's some dude, some other actor, and then there was the director.

191
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,300
 Obviously, that's how movies are made, right?

192
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,100
 It's a home video.

193
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,600
 His mom is filming it.

194
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,300
 The director and the actor, Timothy Chalmet, whatever,

195
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,100
 they're going on to do another movie right now.

196
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,300
 So, you know, out of the three of them, two of them have gone to do this new movie called "Bones and All."

197
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,500
 And the movie is literally about this.

198
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,800
 It's about a young girl, or like a college-age girl, I'm assuming.

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,900
 Every time she falls in love, she eats them.

200
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,100
 So, it's a cannibal movie.

201
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,800
 So, all three of them, all three of them may be in on this for all I know.

202
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
 But they're doing a cannibal movie.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,400
 No, I don't like to conflate the art.

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
 I think that's just a funny aside.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
 They're making a cannibal movie.

206
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,100
 I'm not going to conflate the art with the weirdness of him being murder suspect,

207
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,200
 because people make, I don't think Tom Cruise is a taxi cab hijacking serial killer.

208
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 Like, the art's the art.

209
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,100
 That's the way I view it.

210
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,000
 But I just think that's a funny coincidence.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,100
 And I'm sure Armie Hammer wish he was cast in that.

212
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,800
 He's like, "Oh dude, can I at least be on the set?"

213
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,300
 I got a Twitter email from DreamPillot.

214
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,300
 And then let's segue into this segment, because I've been trying to figure this out.

215
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,000
 Monday Musings, this is our new segment.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,900
 Mike Nope, let's go ahead and hop out of the Jason Jalopy.

217
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,300
 We're going to hop in the Dead or Abidurgeable.

218
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,400
 We're going to fly to a banquet hall.

219
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 We're still doing the Armie Hammer story though.

220
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,100
 So few guys were hoping this was over.

221
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,800
 Nope.

222
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,600
 Mike Nope, Fly Us Out.

223
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,300
 He probably hears that joke all the time.

224
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,100
 Mike Nope, Fly Us in this Dead or Abidurgeable, out to this large dining hall.

225
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,300
 You know, we just have the dining hall in the Durgeable.

226
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,900
 Make it easier.

227
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,300
 Mike Nope wanted to fly.

228
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,500
 Okay, Fly Us to that hometown buffet.

229
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 We're going there.

230
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,900
 DreamPillot sent me an article.

231
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,800
 It was in Cosmopolitan Magazine.

232
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,900
 I think the kids call it Cosmo, but Cosmopolitan Magazine had an article about the kink of cannibalism.

233
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,100
 And it was saying, you know, this is a subset of BDSM.

234
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,000
 Here's my Monday.

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,800
 I can't figure this out.

236
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
 I can't figure this out.

237
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
 How do you pretend to eat somebody?

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
 I get like role-playing and stuff like that.

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
 She's a cop.

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,400
 You're the bank robber.

241
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,100
 Or she's...

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,900
 She's Dr. Octopus and you're Spider-Man, whatever.

243
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,200
 Like stuff to spice up the bedroom.

244
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
 And like you could...

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,400
 I mean, both of those involve you actively fighting somebody.

246
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,100
 You'll never stop you getting Doc Ock or Spray Shaving Cream in her face.

247
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,300
 But like, you can do that.

248
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,300
 I can even spray Shaving Cream in your loved one's face.

249
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,100
 You can pretend like you can role-play and do stuff like that.

250
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,800
 How do you pretend to get eaten?

251
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,500
 That's what I can't figure out.

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 Like the cannibal guy would be like,

253
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,700
 "I just imagine it's how people play with babies."

254
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,200
 And they go, "Nom, nom, nom.

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,900
 I'm gonna eat your tummy."

256
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,800
 And then you like gum the kids...

257
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 Oh, I can't go, go, go, go.

258
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 But you're not actually eating...

259
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,100
 Is that what cannibal fetish is?

260
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,900
 Like I read this big article in Thanks Dream Pillet for sending it over,

261
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,100
 but I still don't get it.

262
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,200
 Like, "Mmm, mmm, mmm.

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 I'm gonna eat you up."

264
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,100
 No, no.

265
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,700
 And then like you take bites of...

266
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,400
 'Cause you don't actually eat them.

267
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,200
 Like they're like...

268
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,900
 The article is like,

269
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,600
 you can nibble on their neck and you can like draw sometimes,

270
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,800
 draw some blood.

271
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
 I'm like, "That's not eating.

272
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
 I don't ever go to a steak restaurant

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,400
 and I'm like, 'I'm gonna put a succulent sirloin, please.'"

274
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
 It's like you eat it.

275
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,100
 So how do you pretend to eat somebody?

276
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,200
 I can kind of figure that out.

277
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,100
 I can kind of figure out you being like,

278
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,400
 "Oh, I'm gonna eat you. I'm a cannibal."

279
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
 "I'm 100% a cannibal."

280
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
 But the fetish goes both ways.

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,800
 There are people who want to be cannibals.

282
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,700
 And then there are people who want to be eaten.

283
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,100
 And I don't get that.

284
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,500
 Like I don't get that.

285
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 I get the mental gymnastics part of it,

286
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,600
 but I don't get how you would pretend to do that.

287
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
 Like you're laying in bed.

288
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
 You're like, "Jason, please go on to the next slide."

289
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,700
 You're laying in bed and then someone's like,

290
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,500
 "Nom, nom, nom. I'm gonna eat you."

291
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,900
 And do you imagine them actually like eat?

292
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,000
 Is it the psychological fear of being eaten?

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,900
 Or is it like do...

294
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,500
 When someone's like, "Nom, nom, nom."

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,400
 Like gumming on your neck, do you imagine it's like walking dead

296
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,900
 and they're actually like ripping pieces?

297
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,200
 Because they're not.

298
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
 They're like, "I'm gonna take your nose.

299
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 I want to take your nose."

300
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 You're like, "No, my nose."

301
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
 They got their little thumb in between their fingers.

302
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
 You're like, "No, no. Let it stop. Let it stop."

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,100
 Like how do you do that?

304
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,600
 Do you like hide your arms in shirts and stuff like that?

305
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
 So you just have like your elbows are sticking out.

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,600
 You're like, "Oh no, he ate my arms. I don't get it."

307
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 I don't get it. It's just a fetish.

308
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
 Or I don't understand it.

309
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,800
 And it's one of those things.

310
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,500
 Like again, if you are pretending that she's the cop

311
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,600
 and you're the burglar, you're breaking into the house

312
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,300
 and she's like, "Stop. Be sexy or I'm gonna shoot."

313
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,800
 And you turn around and you start being sexy.

314
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,200
 Fine. Whatever. Whatever.

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,700
 But the eating thing, like I can't figure out

316
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,500
 how you would pretend to be eaten.

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,200
 I don't get it.

318
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,800
 Because obviously, like I can see my arms.

319
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,300
 Like it just doesn't make any sense to me.

320
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,500
 It's like this.

321
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,600
 If I had a fetish of sleeping with a waitress,

322
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,400
 if that's a, yeah, I do. I do.

323
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
 I love sleeping with waitresses, but

324
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,700
 hypothetically say that I don't have that fetish

325
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,500
 and I now do for the sake of this argument.

326
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,100
 Let's say I hypothetically like sleeping with waitresses.

327
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,600
 I can easily fulfill that.

328
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,700
 I can have my girlfriend dress up like a waitress.

329
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,900
 Super easy.

330
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,000
 Or I can just sleep with waitresses.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,500
 So either way, I'm golden.

332
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,100
 But that doesn't work with being a fetish.

333
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,000
 That doesn't work with being a cannibal.

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,500
 Because I can go nom nom nom.

335
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,700
 I'm gonna eat your belly.

336
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
 Oh no, I ate your thumbs and you like have them hide their thumbs.

337
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,700
 No.

338
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,800
 But you know, it's not real.

339
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
 You know, it doesn't, isn't actually real.

340
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 I think that's a fetish that you're far more likely

341
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,500
 to engage in in real life.

342
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,000
 Because there's nothing you can do to replicate it

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
 in the bedroom at all.

344
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,100
 I mean, I guess if you brought in like fake blood

345
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,700
 and had like Greg Nicotero in the background doing

346
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,100
 special effects makeup and things like that.

347
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,900
 But other than that, no matter what you did in the bedroom,

348
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,000
 it would always leave you wanting more.

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,300
 It would always leave you hungry for more.

350
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,200
 Most fetishes you can completely fulfill with a consenting partner.

351
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,000
 Like furries, you're just yiffing around in the first suits.

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,900
 There you go.

353
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,000
 You want to have sex with Donald Duck.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,300
 You just had sex with a guy dressed like Donald Duck.

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
 That's fine.

356
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,700
 You don't actually then have to go out and find a duck.

357
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,300
 You fulfilled the fantasy of having sex with an anthropomorph.

358
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,200
 That's actually makes more sense because the fantasy isn't

359
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,100
 to have sex with a duck.

360
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,500
 It's to have sex with, but you want to have sex with an anthropomorphic duck.

361
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,000
 So you actually can't fulfill that in real life.

362
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
 You have to use the furry community.

363
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,400
 So that makes sense.

364
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,900
 I get like the logic in that.

365
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,500
 I'm not worried about them running around being in ducks.

366
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,900
 I am worried about how many of them are possibly murdering one or more women in the desert.

367
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
 And this is actually, you guys are going to be shocked,

368
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,600
 but this is actually a great segue for our next story.

369
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 Mike Noe is like, "No, I don't want you to the next story.

370
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
 This is a segue."

371
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
 Mike Noe, yeah, you do.

372
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,000
 Is this next story is all about love?

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,800
 Actually, the first story was about love.

374
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
 The love of eating people.

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But Mike Noe, it's Valentine's Day.

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
 Love is in the air.

377
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,200
 Let's hop in that carpenter copter.

378
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 We're leaving behind San Bernardino County and the hometown buffet.

379
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 We got our pockets full of onion rings.

380
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,800
 We are leaving and we are headed out to an unnamed town.

381
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,700
 In the middle of America.

382
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,700
 (imitates gunshots)

383
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
 We're flying out there.

384
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
 We're eating onion rings.

385
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
 Having a grand old time.

386
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 What we're here in this small town for is a story that was recommended to me by Kentillions.

387
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 A long time listener of the show, Kentillions.

388
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
 Thank you so much for sending this over.

389
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
 This is the saga.

390
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 No one is Project Digi Clips.

391
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:49,600
 Now as Mike is piloting the carpenter copter over this small town, we see a bunch of pre-teens, teenagers walking out of their houses.

392
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 They all have a backpack strapped to their wrist.

393
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 And in their free hand, they're holding a Digi device.

394
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 These are basically Tamagotchi-type toys where you'd raise Digimon and make them fight each other.

395
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 And that was pretty much it.

396
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:13,000
 But it was also the basis for cartoons and comic books and video games, other video actual video games rather than these pieces of junk.

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 As Mike is flying the carpenter copter over, I'm putting my hand on his shoulder.

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm like, "Dude, be ready, be ready."

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And then all of a sudden, all these people raise their Digi devices into the air.

400
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 The sky cracks open.

401
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 (imitates gunshots)

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Reality shifts.

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And we see the children one by one getting sucked up into personalized black holes.

404
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 (imitates gunshots)

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 We have just witnessed the Digi Clips.

406
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 The idea is this.

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 This actually was really big back in 2008 for about two or three months.

408
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You had February to March 2008.

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The idea is this.

410
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Digimon are real.

411
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 The goal?

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Bring them to us.

413
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Or, for the more adventure-prone, we go to them.

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They believed if you held your Digi device to the sky at a precise moment.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Now, the agreed upon time seemed to be March 16th, 2008.

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But apparently they were localized Digi Clips as well.

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You had to confer with your local Digi Dwarfs to figure that one out.

418
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Hey, if you guys are Digimon fans, sorry, because I'm probably not going to be super kind to the program.

419
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 But you're hanging out with the other Digi people.

420
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And you have to hold up your Digi device all at the same time.

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You'll create these black holes.

422
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Now, they say, listen, we know these are toys.

423
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 So it's not so much the fact that the Digi device has the ability to transport you to another dimension.

424
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Because if they did, they'd have to put that on the warning label.

425
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 So they're just toys.

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 The idea is that you are in love with your Digimon.

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So anything that identifies your Digimon you can use.

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They said you can even use your stuffed animals.

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So if you ever were like driving around your town back on March 16th, 2008,

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and you saw a man holding a stuffed dinosaur and pointing it out of the sky,

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 you didn't know it, but that man was a man who didn't have a Digi device, but still wanted to go to the digital realm.

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 What do you do once you enter the Digiverse?

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 The Digiverse is basically, again, I didn't really get into the mythology,

434
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 and I read a Wikipedia article on Digimon itself, and it's just generic.

435
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It was more of a sci-fi version of Pokemon.

436
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Pokemon always seemed like a very nature-based.

437
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Well, it definitely is more sci-fi because they're digital animals, and that was one of the things.

438
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 People go, "Well, if Digimon is real, why can't Pokemon be real?"

439
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And they go, "Pfft, you idiots, you fool, what are you talking about?"

440
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Digital can include anything, anything can be programmed.

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So the Digiverse could actually be real.

442
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 They keep using string theory and the infinite universe theorem, which is true.

443
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And on an infinite timeline and infinite universes, everything's possible.

444
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 There is a Digiverse.

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Fine, I'll give you that.

446
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 But everything else is ridiculous.

447
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 The fact that on a certain day you could hold up a stuffed dinosaur

448
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 or something that reminded you of your favorite Digimon, you'd get sucked into an alternate universe.

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 They believed a lot of it on Law of Attraction.

450
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They believed a lot of it on, if you love something so much, it has to be true.

451
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Which is basically the motto of every stalker, right?

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 So you have that, they say it's like a placebo.

453
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Placebos aren't real, but they help you.

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So if you can give someone a sugar pill and it calms their nervous stomach,

455
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 you can hold up a stuffed animal and fly to an alternate universe.

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 They make this leap of logic.

457
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 But it's digital, see, so it's possible.

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So what do you do when you go to the Digiiverse?

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 This is the steps that were laid out.

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 First off, you find your partner, which I'm assuming is like their waifu.

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I'm assuming it's like the girl, which I know a lot of people like.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Like animated girls, like drawings of girls.

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But if you went to that universe, they'd probably look super weird.

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Because you would not become a cartoon.

465
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You would go to a digital verse, and so you'd be 3D.

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Everything else would be 3D.

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The reason why we're seeing it as a drawing is because animators are drawing.

468
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Let's assume here for a second that their theory is right.

469
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Because I've found this fascinating, and I think we talked about this during the Chris Chan episode as well.

470
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 If you went to the world of Digimon, it would not be 2D cell shaded animation.

471
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That is a human representation of that.

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It's the same thing as if you read the Bible, and there's no photos from the Bible.

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 You would not go back and you'd be like, "Oh, look at all these texts.

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Look at all these words. Jesus looks like a giant wood carving coming at me."

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Because that's all the imagery of how he looks like a Renaissance painting coming at me.

476
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 No, you'd go back and you know that.

477
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 If you went back in time, you would see stuff as it was, not as it's represented.

478
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 So if you went to the Digi verse, there wouldn't be a little dinosaur, a little poorly designed dinosaur.

479
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I didn't like the character designs on that show.

480
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I was not a huge fan of it.

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I'm trying not to completely trash it during this segment, but it wouldn't look like that.

482
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 The girl, Trixie, or Noxy, or whatever their names were, she would look like a normal human girl.

483
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And she wouldn't look like that drawing.

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 It may be a vague comparison, because the person who drew that drawing was influenced by the psychic power of that character across the universe.

485
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Fine.

486
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But it's like Optimus Prime would look like a Michael Bay Optimus Prime.

487
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He wouldn't look less like the drawing, because the cartoon drawing would be a representation of him.

488
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So you would be like, "I'm finally going to go out of this world and I'm going to meet my two-dimensional girlfriend."

489
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And then you go there and she's going to be three-dimensional girlfriend.

490
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And when you ask her, "Hey, are we going to go out digi-hunting today?"

491
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 She's going to be like, "I have to wash my hair," because she's still a fully realized human being.

492
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And maybe she's not that into you, just because you teleported to her through the ether.

493
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 She still may not like you.

494
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So that's something to be prepared for if you ever think about traveling to a fictional universe.

495
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But you find your partner, you also have to then find a real digi-device.

496
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Digi-device is like how you like, they jump out of it or something like that.

497
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Probably shouldn't have done more research, but the show just doesn't interest me.

498
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Then you just kind of go on adventures.

499
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It's like Pokemon. Just keep thinking of Pokemon, but try to be more edgy.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I guess the devil's in it. There's a guy named Devilmon.

501
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 All the people have "mon" at the end of the name, which means monster.

502
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I wonder if there's a "mon-mon," which is like a monster monster.

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Okay, I think that's a dad joke, but it's not. It's a Monday Musing.

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 But anyways, they go there and they're kind of like going on adventures and they're trying to defeat evil.

505
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I think Digimon was less about just, you know, cock fighting with electrical animals like Pokemon.

506
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It was out like they were trying to save the world or whatever.

507
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Now that I'm recording this segment, when I was doing the research, I was like, "Oh, I'm fine.

508
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I read a single Wikipedia article on it. I'm good. Devil exists. I'm totally good."

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So what type of people, though, are best suited to go to the Digiverse?

510
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 This is a very, very fascinating subculture.

511
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And I guess I should give you the spoiler alert. It didn't happen.

512
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 None of this happened, right?

513
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But for two months, we really had people really believe in this.

514
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Now here's the thing. Digimon is not like Pokemon.

515
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 You go to the Pokemon universe, the most you're going to do is get like electrocuted, which is pretty bad, right?

516
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Squirtle, Squirtle, Rune's your new shirt.

517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It's pretty benign. It's like being in our world, but a little more intense.

518
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But most of the Pokemon, as long as you're not walking around the forest or an active Pokemon trainer, you're not going to run into them that much.

519
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Digimon's far more violent. There's like a conflict going on. You have the Devilmon trying to do whatever the Devilmon does.

520
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 His Monmonishmans are coming after you. All sorts of craziness.

521
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So this isn't for the weak of heart. These people, these teenagers are possibly heading into a war zone.

522
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 That's what makes us so fascinating.

523
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I can go on and on about particular anecdotes.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 One guy says he goes to the gymnasium every day. Who calls it a gymnasium unless he's like on a balance beam?

525
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 But he goes to the gymnasium every day. He'll be fine fighting T-Rexes, digital T-Rexes.

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He'll be fine. He's worried about other people.

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 One guy says that he's afraid if he goes there, he won't be Christian anymore.

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 To which an atheist says you're an idiot for believing in Christianity anyways.

529
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 But the Digiverse, now that, that is something to believe in.

530
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 You have all these weird anecdotes that I could kind of pick apart.

531
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 We've done that before. We did that with the Christian episode. We've done that before.

532
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I find it so fascinating that these people are willing to enter a bloodbath for a better life.

533
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It's fascinating. It's a fascinating thing.

534
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 There was one person who posted, "Listen, we got to be realistic about this stuff."

535
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Traveling to a digital realm, a whole lot of things can go wrong.

536
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 There was one voice of sanity, because everyone was taken this seriously,

537
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 but there was one voice of sanity amongst these people.

538
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 They go, "You're going through a portal to a digital world first off."

539
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 You may go insane simply by being transmitted into digital energy.

540
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 We don't know what's going to happen when you become part of the digital world.

541
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Two, they said, "There's no guarantee that you're going to land in a lush forest."

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And you look over and there's a cute little Digimon next to you.

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Paramon or Radishmon or whatever.

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 You have no idea. You may appear in a part of the planet where there's nothing.

545
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He goes, "What if you appear on a deserted island?

546
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 What if you appear in the middle of the ocean?

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 You get sucked out of Des Moines, Iowa.

548
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And the next thing you know, you're plummeted into the warm, salty depths of an alien planet's ocean."

549
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 You don't know what's on the other side of that portal.

550
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 As much as you want to go through that realm to someplace different,

551
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 you are going to be deposited someplace random.

552
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's not like Starfleet beaming me up.

553
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 They're not going to be me up in a deep space.

554
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 They're not going to be me up on a deserted island.

555
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But if there was a thing hold up your Star Trek Communicator toy on October 4th,

556
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 spaceship comes overhead, you get beamed aboard the Defiant. I'm doing it.

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But this would be random.

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And the world of Digimon is so wild and untamed.

559
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And there's all these conflicts going on.

560
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 You may just appear in the middle of a battle and get squished or eaten or enslaved

561
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 before you find your partner, before you get your Digi device and become part of the saga.

562
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 You're a footnote.

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You're not even that.

564
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 You're just an event.

565
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 You get in the way of a battle and are quickly dispatched.

566
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 You're a pile of bones on a deserted island.

567
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 You're devoured in the dark depths.

568
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 You don't even see what eats you and what spins days dissolving you in its stomach.

569
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 That joke was for you.

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Or me.

571
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 That one is for you if you're still listening.

572
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 You don't know where you're going to end up.

573
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 There's a very fascinating way to look at this.

574
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 That person then said, "However, there's also the chance that you find your soulmate in the Digiverse."

575
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So he was willing to play the odds.

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 That was literally how he ended that comment.

577
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Like, he said a very, very lucid thing.

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 We don't know what's going to happen.

579
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 But on the other hand, you may get some.

580
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I don't think I would take that chance.

581
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I would take a chance going into a safe universe.

582
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 A safe-ish, like obviously Marvel universe.

583
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You're going to get squished by Giant Man.

584
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Or Thanos is going to snap you out of existence or something like that.

585
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 It's a chance of it at least.

586
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Star Trek, there's a chance you get the alien brain parasite.

587
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 But at least you would be going to like New York.

588
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Or you would be going to the Enterprise.

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 This guy knew that this was such a chaotic event.

590
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 They were trying to force happen that anything could go wrong.

591
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 It's funny because as much as I dismiss this,

592
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 part of it comes from the fact that I don't really know Digimon that well.

593
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 If out of all the fictional universes that existed, if this was the one that existed,

594
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I'd be extremely disappointed.

595
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I obviously have favorites you do too.

596
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 But on the other hand, I believe in stuff like infinite universes, infinite timelines.

597
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 All things are possible.

598
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And law of attraction.

599
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I don't think they work in the way that they're talking about.

600
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 There's limits to it.

601
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 I can't law of attraction my body into being yogurt.

602
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But there's probably in an infinite timeline in Alternate Universe a reality where I am yogurt.

603
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I'm yogurt right now.

604
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I think it's an interesting concept.

605
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It's something we've covered before and it's something we've thought about before as kids wanting to go to these fictional universes.

606
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But what if you didn't want to go to the fictional universe?

607
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 The thing when you use magic and law of attraction can be considered magic in a sense.

608
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You're bending the world to your will.

609
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Is that if you don't know what you're doing, things aren't going to work out well.

610
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 When you have a bunch of preteens and teens holding up pieces of plastic and stuffed animals on March 16th,

611
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 waiting to be thrust into this digital world and nothing happens, they just go home.

612
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 But did nothing happen?

613
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Is it possible that they remained on her, but their combined willpower did open up a portal somewhere?

614
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Just wasn't for them.

615
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 It's for the young woman jogging with her dog through the forest.

616
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 She went missing.

617
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 You know the story.

618
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 She's never found.

619
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 No trace of her.

620
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Husband's a suspect.

621
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 He's eventually cleared.

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 12 years later, people are still wondering what happened to Nancy Silva.

623
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 It was March 16th, 2008, when she was on that run.

624
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 But she doesn't know what date it is now.

625
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 In the Digiverse, she's considered an anomaly.

626
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Nobody knows where she came from.

627
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Nobody knows what powers she might have.

628
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And all sides are looking for her.

629
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 So she runs.

630
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 She hides.

631
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And she prays.

632
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But in our world, she's just a face on a missing poster.

633
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 The smiling face of a woman who will never be found again.

634
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
