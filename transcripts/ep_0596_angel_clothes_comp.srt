1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 When a man's wife threatens to castrate him while he's sleeping, he's somehow still able to fall asleep.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
 But when he wakes up with shredded underwear,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,200
 he thinks that might have been more than just the threat.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,800
 A man loves to smoke cigarettes and loves to eat at diners.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,500
 What happens when those two collide in a paranormal explosion?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
 And then we take a look at a story of- this story's not funny.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm just laughing at those other two. This last story is kind of sad and touching.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,500
 Then we take a look at the story of a man who is about to experience his final days on Earth.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
 He's terminally ill in the hospital.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,500
 But in a moment, he silently vanishes and finds himself in a chapel with a tall pale stranger.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,000
 [Music]

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Speaking of fun, this person's very, very fun, I'm assuming, because they support the show.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Or one of our Legacy Patreon's only cool people support the show.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,500
 One of our Legacy Patreon's petite bourgeois.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to petite bourgeois. She's tiny, she's petite, and she's bougie.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 She has on a bunch of Gucci stuff.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So, petite, thank you so much for supporting the show.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
 You are going to pick you up and put you in my pocket.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,000
 But you're also going to be the captain and the pilot of this episode.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You can't support the Patreon. You're still cool.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Even if you don't support the Patreon, you're still a cool person.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
 But that's okay. It's okay that you're cool.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,000
 But it's also okay that you don't support the show.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Just spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot. I got a bunch of cool cats.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Listen to the show. Petite bourgeois, I'm going to take you out of my pocket.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And we're going to put you in the... Jason Jalopy, you're going to get a couple of phone books to sit on.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,500
 And then all work the gas pedals. It's going to be super confusing.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
 But you are going to drive us away from Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We're headed out to Painesville, Ohio.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,500
 *meows*

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
 We get to Painesville, Ohio. The year is 1991.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And petite, go ahead and stop at this house right here.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,500
 And we're just sitting in the car. It's nighttime and we hear a fight, an argument going on in this house.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 Why I never? You're such a bad husband and stuff.

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 And then the husband's like, "I'm not that bad. I'm way better than Tom down the street. He's horrible.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'm pretty sure that guy's a serial killer." And she's like, "What? No, you're the worst husband in this house right now.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,500
 They're having this big argument." And we should probably check on Tom later on because he might be a serial killer.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,000
 They're having this big argument. And eventually she goes, "Listen, you better sleep on the couch tonight.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Because if you don't, I'm going to cut your balls off."

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
 That's a pretty, pretty stern threat.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 Also, I have to say this though, I've never been married.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 But I love sleeping on couches. If I ever get married, I'm going to be like, a super lame, super lame.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
 Just so she's like, "Go sleep on the couch." And I'm like, "Yippee!"

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
 And I'm like, "Sleeping on the couch all the time? Have a little teddy bear?"

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
 She's like, "I don't know. Maybe I'm going to start punishing you by making you sleep in the bed."

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I'm like, "Uh..."

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 He goes downstairs and he sleeps on the couch.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,500
 *humming*

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 What the? You like that song? You like that royalty-free song? It's morning!

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
 The sun's come up, birds are tweeting.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 *sad noise* We're waking up in the Jason Jalopy we slept outside all night.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 This man, who was sleeping in his house, he wakes up and he sees that his underwear has been cut to ribbons with a razor blade.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
 *gasp*

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
 He's looking around. He's like, "Oh my god, that wasn't just a threat.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Like in the middle of the night, my wife tried to chop my balls off."

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,500
 He goes to work, which I would call in that day. I'd be like, "I don't know about this."

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,000
 He goes to work and he starts telling his co-workers, "I don't know.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Do you think I could spend the night in your place? Do you have a couch I can sleep on?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Or are you bunk bed? Even we could be bunkmates."

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Because I'm pretty sure my wife tried to castrate me last night.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 People are like, "What are you talking about?" And he goes, "Listen, my wife threatened me."

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 She said she's going to cut my balls off.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And yeah, I'll report that to the police later because that's domestic violence.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,500
 But I woke up and my underwear was shredded and everyone's just eating their sandwiches.

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 They're like, "Oh, you know."

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 So what if you guys aren't shocked that my wife threatened to chop my balls off

71
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
 and then I wake up and my underwear is shredded?

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,500
 They're like, "It's kind of weird, but your wife didn't do it."

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 And the guy's like, "What? What do you mean my wife didn't do it?"

74
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,000
 Who else would do it? All of a sudden the lights flicker in the room

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,500
 and there's like an old timer at the company smoking a pipe.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,000
 He's like, "You don't know the tale of how long you've lived in Plainsville, Ohio."

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
 [smooching]

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
 He's not blowing kisses, he's puffing on his pipe.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,500
 "You don't know the tales now, do you?"

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 But everyone else at work had heard of the BVD Bandit.

81
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,000
 What had been going on was a man had been breaking--this had been going on for a while.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,500
 A man had been breaking into houses where men were sleeping.

83
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 And as the men were totally asleep, he would sneak up in the darkness on them

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,000
 and begin to fondle their genitals while they're sleeping.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And then, shlink, pull out a razor blade and begin to cut the underwear off the sleeping men.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
 Now, I don't know about the residents of Plainsville, Ohio,

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,000
 but I'm not that deep of a sleeper, right?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,500
 If a fly landed on my junk, I'd probably wake up.

89
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,000
 I don't understand this, but some of them did wake up.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,500
 Some of them did wake up, and they waked up to find a strange man standing over them,

91
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 playing with their balls, so you would immediately just want to, you know, beat this dude up.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,000
 And so you would jump up to go chase the guy and your underwear-- [laughs]

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Your underwear fell off.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,500
 Multiple times, people were like, "Yeah, I woke up, this guy broke in my house.

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 He was sexually assaulting me. When I went to chase him, my underwear fell off."

96
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,000
 So I don't know if the slashing of the underwear was actually part of his escape plan.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,500
 He's like, "Ha, they'll never catch me. No one will ever run naked after a pervert."

98
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 Or if it was part of his fetish.

99
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 But I guess we could know, because they actually did arrest this guy.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 They were able to arrest him. They charged him with 21 counts of burglary, 4 counts of sexual imposition,

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 and he was facing 45 years in prison.

102
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 Now, this story happened back in 1991.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 So what is that? Like 30 years ago? Is it?

104
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
 Yeah, it's about 30 years ago. So even if he got the maximum,

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,000
 he's going to be walking the streets of Plainsville, Ohio in another 15 years.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 You're like, "Just don't worry about that. I don't live in Plainsville, Ohio.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I don't care what happens in 15 years. Doesn't matter."

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 The weird thing is, is I could never, ever find out how long he got sentenced for.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 His name was Van W. Patterson, who's 23 years old.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I could never find out how much time he actually got.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 But we don't know. This guy may be walking free right now.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Hopefully he's been cured of this bizarre fetish.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
 But, you know, fetish is man...

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 Actually, he probably runs a website at this time.

115
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 /myundies.com

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 where there's just dark web videos of men sleeping

117
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 and someone walking up to him with a razor blade.

118
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 Creepy story. Creepy story. Imagine a man sneaking into your house,

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 cutting up your underwear while it's still on you.

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 If it's in the drawer, go nuts! Chop it all off!

121
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 I'll go buy more, but don't cut it while it's on me.

122
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 And then, you know, don't fondle me either. That's pretty disgusting.

123
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,000
 I think that's even more disgusting, but...

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 The second one involves a razor blade next to my genitals,

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 so that's very worrisome as well.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And it's the dark. It's in the dark when you're doing it.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So, spooky all around. Petit bourgeois.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Let's go ahead and pull you out of the Jason Jalopy.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We are going to now put you in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We are headed out to Malaysia.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 [Durgible sound]

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,500
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is flying out there. Little Petit is on a bunch of phone books.

133
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,000
 You're like, "Jason, did they even make phone books anymore?"

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 When's the last time you saw a phone book big enough to actually stack up to put someone on?

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,500
 We have a bunch of hard drives then, so Petit Bourgeois can stand on them.

136
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 Specifically, we're headed out to Georgetown.

137
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 That's in Penang, which I'm assuming is some sort of state or region in Malaysia.

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is floating overhead and we see down below us,

139
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,000
 we see a little business land right there.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,500
 Outside this business is a man named Eriph Shah R.K.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 He actually wrote this letter to the opinion page of a newspaper called The New Straight Times.

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,000
 Apparently, it's like a Malaysian newspaper.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,500
 I think they have versions all over the world, but this one's the Malaysian version.

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 He's basically writing this letter like, "Dear Diary,"

145
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,000
 when he scratched that diary and he put, "Dear New Straight's Times."

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,500
 He's going to tell us a story. So, we're standing outside this business

147
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 and he starts telling us a story and there's a flashback.

148
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 He's like, "Long, long time ago."

149
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,000
 So now we're just...it's like a silent movie. We're all moving super fast.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,500
 [humming]

151
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's not that long ago. It's actually like a week before he writes the letter.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Anyways, he tells the story. I don't know why I set up that weird intro.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
 Here's the story.

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 His friend, we'll call his friend, Dougie.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,000
 Dougie is driving for a work meeting, so it's a pretty far distance

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,500
 and he sees an R&R, which is like a rest and relaxation area.

157
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 And in Malaysia, they actually usually have eateries set up.

158
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 In America, it's just like a parking lot where you can empty your septic tank

159
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 and like some restrooms. And then the unforgiving woods surrounding it.

160
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 I always hated rest stops because you pull into them

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
 and then it's just the darkness of the woods in front of you.

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,500
 You're like, "Your parents are like, "Do you need these restrooms?"

163
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 You're like, "I already beat my pants when pulled up, bro. I don't like the woods."

164
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,000
 But in America, it's just like these little stops where you can let your dog run around, stuff like that.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Apparently in Malaysia, there's diners set up at these R&Rs, these rest and relaxation areas.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Dougie's driving this long distance. He's on the way for a work trip.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 He sees this R&R. He goes, "Oh, I'm gonna stop there. I'm gonna get something to eat."

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,500
 He goes there. He orders food. There's just a bunch of diners eating.

169
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 Like a normal restaurant. He's a very beautiful waitress.

170
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 He's walking. "Hey, sugar, what you want?"

171
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 He's like, "I don't know. How about some of you?"

172
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 Apparently we're in a 1950s movie.

173
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 He orders some food. He's eating it up.

174
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 And he's like, "I gotta go to the bathroom."

175
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,000
 So he goes to the bathroom, does his business, and then he's washing his hands.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 [Water tap sounds]

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And the sink next to him, the water tap turns on by itself.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 [Water tap sounds]

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And he looks over at it. Very puzzling.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Shouldn't do that. Turns it off.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 [Water tap sounds]

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 He likes this theater of the mind, and then he's continuing to wash his hands.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And then again, [Water tap sounds]

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 The other tap turns on.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 He goes back to it. He doesn't think much of it. He goes back to his table,

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,500
 finishes eating his food, leaves the waitress a tip, goes on his way.

187
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 But as he's driving to his hotel, he notices the car is driving a little odd.

188
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 Seems to be a little off. He doesn't really think anything of it, though.

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 Very non-plus-ed guy, Duggy.

190
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 He gets to his hotel, he goes to sleep.

191
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 Later on, it's not like he woke up the next morning.

192
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 [Water tap sounds]

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 You're like, "I don't even know what that stupid song is you're trying to sing."

194
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 He doesn't wake up the next morning immediately, call his family,

195
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,000
 but at a certain point he's talking to his family, and he's like, "Hey, yeah, I stopped at a new rest and relaxation area.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 They have a really nice diner."

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He looks at his wife, he's like, "Oh, the waitress is super ugly. Grr, gross. Bleh."

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 But, um, it also, I think the plot means faulty, but it's really nice diner,

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 and his family's looking at him, and they go, "What?"

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 He's like, "Yeah, they rest and relaxation diner in this area."

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And his family goes, "That place hasn't been built yet."

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 They're like, "They're planning on building it."

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,500
 And Dougie starts to get really mad. He's like, "No, I went there. I ate a bunch of food. I went to the bathroom.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 And then I, I, I, I, I, I don't know what do you want me to do? Just drive minute by minute."

205
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 I was there, and the family's like, "That place doesn't exist yet."

206
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 So he's like, "Come on guys, you guys, you kids are staying over from school today. I'm calling in sick to work.

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,000
 Everyone in the car, we're driving out to that area. I'm gonna prove to you that this place is up and running."

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,500
 He's driving his family out there, they get there, and it's under construction.

209
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,000
 Now remember, he saw it falling in operation. There was a bunch of people in there, eating.

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,500
 There was a beautiful waitress in the bathroom, which is all you can hope for from a diner.

211
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,000
 He goes in there, it is not open. It's not been opened yet.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 There is no way that you could have a bunch of people eating there or employees.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,500
 And oddly enough, if that's not weird enough, but another odd detail is he walks up and the tip that he left the waitress is sitting on the table.

214
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 He was at, it's just sitting there collecting dust.

215
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 Now, faced with this series of events, what do you think his next course of action was?

216
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:47,000
 According to the author of this letter, according to Eryth Shah, Dougie then got super mad because the waitress left the tip.

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
 He's like, "What? I gave her this money, she didn't even take it with her?"

218
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 "Oh, what a waste, I'm gonna take this back."

219
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 He's looking at each other like, "The restaurant doesn't exist. There was no waitress. How can you be mad at a phantom?"

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 And we should probably call the doctor because this guy needs to get checked out.

221
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 He's like, "Ah, the service was so good. She deserved this tip."

222
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 A couple days later, after this whole event, he's like, "Whatever, the waitress, she doesn't deserve this tip.

223
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,000
 Everyone's like, "She doesn't exist." He's like, "Ah, no, she doesn't exist."

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,500
 He's totally adamant that the place existed and now maybe it's some huge prank or something like that.

225
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 He can't get through his head, but one day he's at work with Arif and he goes, "Hey, I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette."

226
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:38,000
 He smoked all the time and where he smoked at work was he would go to this staircase and he'd sit down, light up a nice little sig.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,500
 "Menthol fresh," he'd said, "after every single drag." That's why they made him go to the stairwell.

228
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 They're like, "Dougie, you're so irritating."

229
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 "Menthol fresh," which he's mispronouncing it anyways.

230
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:03,000
 But then he goes into the stairwell and he gets ready to say his famous catchphrase and he sees a figure.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,500
 No, not just a figure. A woman. No, not just a woman.

232
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:21,000
 It's the beautiful waitress from the rest stop and she turns to him with eyeless sockets, just darkness reaching into the back of her skull.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And he looks at her. He drops that cigarette. He runs away.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 The name of this article, the name that's seen, he didn't run away. He's not running to this day.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 He just ran into work. He's like, "Guys, you won't believe what happened. I stopped smoking little asterisks there."

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,500
 The name of this letter that was written for the New Straight Times, which they published in their opinion section, was a ghost.

237
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 Let me get the exact title. A ghost scared off my friend's smoking habit.

238
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,000
 So the whole point of this article was about a guy who meets a ghost to make some stop smoking.

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,500
 First off, that's not true. He just stopped smoking in the stairwell and specifically says that in the letter.

240
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 And then my friend stopped smoking there because a spooky ghost showed up. Of course, you're not going to smoke there.

241
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 But it's not like that was the only place in the world to smoke. He can just smoke somewhere else.

242
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 He can smoke in another staircase. The staircase going up is more angelic.

243
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 But I think they're kind of burying the lead. I think they're kind of burying the lead with this one.

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:31,000
 The story isn't my friend stopped smoking because he saw a ghost. The story is my friend went to an alternate reality

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 where a restaurant's already been built and was able to interact with that reality on such a level that he left money there.

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Actually, now that I think about it, he left money for the tip. But what about the money? Where's the money he used to buy the food?

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,500
 I'd be more mad about that. I'm like, "What? I paid 10 bucks for a ghost burger?"

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 You're like, "I was wondering why I went to bed hungry that night."

249
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 You're like, "Oh man, look at all this food. You're eating all these appetizers, chicken wings and everything."

250
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 You're like, "Buy $100 worth of food and then you drive back to the hotel. You're starving."

251
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 You're like, "Ahh! Why am I so hungry?" You have to stop and buy some M&Ms just to go to sleep.

252
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 Like, we're going to check his credit card statement and prove he had been there.

253
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,000
 Like, forget the tip. Forget the five bucks he left for the waitress.

254
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Where's the money he actually spent on that burger and the coffee and all that stuff?

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 The fact that he saw a ghost in a stairwell. I can tell you that story.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 My friend likes to smoke. He went to a spooky stairwell. He saw a ghost. He stopped smoking there.

257
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 At the end, I don't have to write a letter to the editor for that one.

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,500
 That's not the story. The story is this guy.

259
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 Went to an alternate dimension or the future and interacted with a whole group of people.

260
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 "Eat the food! Eat future food!" Metawaitress.

261
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,000
 And then you have a ghost in the bathroom. But even that's minor compared to the fact that he traveled to an alternate reality.

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Or the fact that this man may be so insane. He's driving at night. He's super tired.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He sees an abandoned work site for a restaurant. He breaks in and imagines a restaurant full of people.

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Did you imagine stumbling across that scene? You're also driving late at night.

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,500
 You see a rest stop and you pull in and you see a restaurant under construction.

266
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 And you see a man in there going "Mmm, mmm, mmm, this is the best pie I've ever eaten!"

267
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,000
 He's talking super loud. And you hear just like a fork hitting an empty plate.

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,500
 And he's like "I'll have seconds!" "You sure are beautiful!"

269
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 And you just are looking at this dark empty diner.

270
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 That's actually scarier than a ghost story because that dude is completely loony.

271
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 But a very interesting, I don't know if I'd classify that as a Mandela effect or a ghost story or both.

272
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,000
 I do find that story very, very fascinating. Not so much for the eyeless woman in the stairwell.

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But the fact that this man stopped at a place was able to try and give money to the future.

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Or to this alternate dimension. Eat alternate dimension food and then argue with people about it.

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And then get mad that his tip was still there. Very bizarre story.

276
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
 The ghost popping out of the stairwell, whatever.

277
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:21,000
 I mean that is spooky, but that's like fifth grade girl spooky that you tell at a sleepover.

278
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,500
 We're way above that. We only tell these stories all the time actually.

279
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 I always tell those spooky stories. I love them. I'm a fifth grade girl.

280
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,000
 Petite bouge wall. Let's put you in the carboner copter.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,500
 We're actually all going to shrink ourselves down to join Petite in the world of the tiny.

282
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 We're going to put you in the carboner copter. It's a little toy copter now.

283
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,000
 And we are headed out to Atlanta, Georgia.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Wait, no it's tiny now.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Little toy carpentry copter flying over the state of Georgia.

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It's January 4th 1983 and now we're back to normal size.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Otherwise the rest of the story we're the littles running around this hospital,

288
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,500
 carrying around sewing button shields and little needles for swords.

289
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 As awesome as that would be. Doesn't really fit this story.

290
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 So we're all normal size. We're walking around the hospital.

291
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 It's January 4th 1983. It's three in the morning.

292
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 The spookiest time of day.

293
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 Melissa Deal 4th. She's currently in the hospital, but not as a patient.

294
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,000
 Her husband is terminally ill. She's in her husband Chris's hospital room.

295
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 He's sleeping. And she finally is able to find a moment to sleep herself.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,500
 But at 3 a.m. she feels a hand on her shoulder. Waking her up. What? Huh? What?

297
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 And there's a nurse standing there and she's like, "Uh, I don't know where your husband's at."

298
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 There's less fun ways to get woken up, i.e. having your underwear cut off by a razor blade.

299
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,500
 But this one is up there too. Your terminally ill husband is missing.

300
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,000
 And so Melissa wakes up and the nurses looking for- they can't find her husband.

301
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,500
 And Melissa can't figure it out because, you know, hospital rooms aren't known for being the most spacious areas.

302
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 And he's hooked up to like this IV bag and all these monitors and things like that.

303
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,000
 And she's trying to figure out while she's trying to process that her husband's missing,

304
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 how is it possible for him to have even left the room?

305
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He would have had to navigate past her with all of this gear without making any noise.

306
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Because her sleep hasn't been that deep anyways. She's very troubled. She's about to lose the love of her life.

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 He was also somehow able to sneak past the nurses station that was outside of his room.

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,500
 Everyone begins searching the hospital. They have no idea.

309
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 You know, someone who's terminally ill, you don't know what they're going to do.

310
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 So there's a- there is a frantic nature to it.

311
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 Plus the mystery of how he went missing in the first place.

312
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 Melissa is running around the hospital looking for him. And she runs past a chapel.

313
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Most hospitals, at least in America, have a chapel in them. Any faith can use them.

314
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 It's just a quiet place for contemplation.

315
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,000
 She runs past the chapel, the door's open, and she sees her husband sitting there.

316
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,500
 And she immediately is overwhelmed by both relief and a little bit- a little angry, right?

317
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 A little angry. No one likes being worried.

318
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 But she sees a man she's never seen before sitting next to him on the pew in this chapel.

319
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 As she walks into the chapel, she's- she's just furious.

320
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,000
 She's just- where have you been? What's going on? How did you get past me?

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,500
 Can you teach me that trick? I want to be a ninja someday.

322
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 She's furious. She's just throwing these questions at him.

323
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,000
 And Chris is calm.

324
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Chris seems at peace.

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And the stranger is really not reacting to this at all.

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And as Melissa's getting closer to this, even though her words are very angry,

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 she's kind of slowing down herself. She- not- not verbally.

328
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 She's not talking super slow, but she's been able to take in the totality-

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 'cause she's able to take in the totality of the scene.

330
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,500
 This man is an odd duck. He's a tall man with pale white skin.

331
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 That's perfectly smooth.

332
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 All of his clothes- he's wearing like a flannel shirt, jeans, and boots.

333
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 She gets closer to them. She notices that all of them look new.

334
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 Not necessarily like clean and nice.

335
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 She says they look like they just came off of a rack at a store.

336
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,000
 They were perfect. They were showroom perfect clothing.

337
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 She gets to Chris. The stranger is just kind of staring at the ground,

338
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 trying to not interfere with what's going on, trying to really not be noticed,

339
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 but he's very tall. And Melissa notices his eyes are pale blue.

340
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She says, "I've never seen eyes like that on a human before."

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 So I'm not talking about every show often you'll get some Eastern European model

342
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 with really crazy eyes. Not that.

343
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Just inhumanly blue eyes.

344
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Chris is just sitting there, and even though she's really mad, she's really relieved,

345
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 she can't understand how any of this happened.

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,500
 Chris turns to her and goes, "I just need this time here right now."

347
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 And she keeps protesting, and he goes, "I need this time here."

348
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,000
 And so reluctantly, she agrees to just leave him with this stranger.

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
 She goes back and she waits in his hospital room,

350
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 and eventually Chris comes walking back with all of his IV bags,

351
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 everything that he needed, that somehow he was able to sneak past her and past the nurses station.

352
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,000
 He's walking through the hospital, pulling his little IV dolly.

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And she said he seemed so full of life. He was smiling.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 He walks in and the nurses come in and they get him back into bed and he's laying there.

355
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
 And she just sits there and she's looking at her husband.

356
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:56,000
 And he goes, "Melissa, that was an angel. It's not that I think it was an angel. That was an angel.

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 He came to me. That was my guardian angel."

358
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,500
 Chris died two days after this event.

359
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,000
 Now this was reported by a group called CNI News.

360
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I actually wasn't able to track down.

361
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I'm assuming it was a much older website or newspaper at some point.

362
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They don't exist that I can find online.

363
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com. They got it from CNI News.

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It's an interesting story because we see the--

365
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,500
 and I'm not going to dive too much into the interpretations of it,

366
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 because I think I've done that several times on the show,

367
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 but we do see the parallels between an alien abduction type of event, somebody disappearing like that.

368
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 Making no noise, being teleported, however you want to phrase it.

369
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 And then you have the idea of the smooth skin also that is very connected to alien mythology,

370
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,000
 the bright blue eyes, the pale skin.

371
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Those usually match the Nordic aliens. It's very tall.

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And I don't want to get into the whole thing like our aliens, demons, or angels and things like that.

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 We've explored that on our show before.

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I want to talk about one of the unique details here is the fact that it was wearing the new clothes.

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 That was the detail that really stood out to me.

376
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We've heard stories about guardian angels before.

377
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I think they're very touching stories.

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I think they give people a moment of peace.

379
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,500
 I love those type of stories.

380
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 But the new clothes, that's a very bizarre detail.

381
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 I don't recall coming across that before.

382
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 We have so many times are aliens.

383
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 That's really what, I mean it's a guardian angel, sure, but it's definitely alien in appearance.

384
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 So that's why I keep kind of going back to that.

385
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
 Aliens generally have their own uniforms.

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,500
 They have their own space clothes, diving suits, or skin tight clothing.

387
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 Very rarely do you see them in civilian clothes.

388
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 It does happen, but it's rare.

389
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 But even then they've never been, suggested, is wearing perfect clothing.

390
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,000
 Sometimes clothing of a different time period, sometimes clothing that's ill-fitting.

391
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 But I can't recall, you guys can correct me, but I can't recall a time that I've talked about

392
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 somebody from out of this reality, out of this world wearing clothes that are perfect.

393
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I think it's very interesting that this figure who we would think as a guardian angel is wearing brand new clothing.

394
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,500
 I just find that such a bizarre detail.

395
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 When you research this stuff for 30 years, it's things like that that stand out to you that makes the story more believable.

396
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 It's details like that that usually aren't made up because it's not part of the lore.

397
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 If she had walked in and he turned around and she goes, "And I swear he had a halo over his head.

398
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 My eyes would have rolled so hard."

399
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
 You know what I mean?

400
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,000
 Because if you're making it up you would play into what people know about guardian angels.

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But the fact that he has clothes that were brand new, looked like he came off of a showroom.

402
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 That's a detail that's so interesting that it actually gives the story more validity.

403
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I could wrap this episode up and talk more about before you die and see guardian angels and stuff like that.

404
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 That's really how I planned to end it.

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I was going to go, "So someday if you're going to..."

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 But I figured that's a downer, right?

407
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,500
 We all know we're going to die. We all know that our loved ones are going to die.

408
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 I'm not going to play out some narrative device to wrap up this episode and say,

409
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 "And then someday you'll see your guardian angel too."

410
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 I think I already pretty much went over that.

411
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 I think someday you will see your guardian angel.

412
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 Whether or not you believe in angels or not, I think in the moment right before you die, you will find peace.

413
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 And I think it should give you peace if you think of your loved ones,

414
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 whether they've died like this man of a terminal illness or if they've died suddenly.

415
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,500
 I truly believe that in those last moments, they find peace.

416
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,000
 No matter how gruesome or violent it could be leading up to it, they find peace.

417
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,500
 And not the peaceness of the cold black void of death.

418
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 I'm talking about before you die.

419
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 Think about when you dream.

420
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 They say a dream only lasts seven seconds, but in our mind they last hours.

421
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 I believe that translates to our last moments as well.

422
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 Where you could be dead.

423
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 You go from that living biological organism to a dead biological organism and there's like seconds pass.

424
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 But in those two, three seconds, an entire lifetime can be lived through your mind.

425
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 That is just as real as this one.

426
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 I think it's very important for us not to fear death.

427
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 I have a problem with fearing.

428
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 I don't fear death, I overthink it.

429
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 And I really have to work through it.

430
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 I overthink it.

431
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
 Like what's it gonna be like?

432
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 How's it gonna be?

433
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 Is this third eye blind?

434
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
 Is that song gonna be on loop?

435
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 Like how's everything gonna go?

436
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 I overthink death and that makes me worried about it.

437
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 I don't fear it, but I overthink it.

438
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 I find myself in that headspace a lot.

439
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 So maybe I'm just talking to myself at this point, but I don't think so.

440
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 I think most people, I think a lot of people think about it.

441
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 So yeah, in that moment before you die, in that moment before you loved one dies, know that there was a peaceful dream.

442
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 A transfer from this life to the next.

443
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 It may not have been as unusual as appearing in a chapel next to a tall stranger who's giving you words of wisdom that you can take to the next life.

444
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 It may not be that dynamic.

445
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 It may be something much more quiet and mundane.

446
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 It may be a return to a place that you loved growing up.

447
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 And the last moments on this or world are spent in that beautiful memory for as long as possible.

448
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 We don't know the truth, and hopefully we won't know the truth for a long time.

449
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 Hopefully we all live very long and healthy lives.

450
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:40,500
 But I believe when that time comes, we will find the peace that Chris found when he talked to his guardian angel.
