1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 When a young woman wakes up in the middle of the night to a strange visitor standing

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,360
 over her bed, she has to ask herself, is it a burglar?

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,200
 A ghost?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,840
 Or something even far more bizarre?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,240
 And then we take a look at the future of AI technology we've talked about a lot on this

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,040
 show and it just keeps getting weirder.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,840
 Is it possible by unleashing artificial intelligence across the internet to create everything from

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,200
 speeches to artwork, we're actually opening a portal to hell today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:49,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,640
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
 Let's go.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,760
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command is a longtime supporter of the show and probably the first

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,000
 person who's bought me the most books in my life.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,120
 I think you bought me more books than my mom at this point.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,040
 Everyone welcome walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
 That's kind of me.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,560
 My mom actually bought me a lot of books.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,000
 She hasn't bought me that many.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 That kind of sound like I was snubbing my mom.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,240
 Well, he's a Dead Rabbit Command right now.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
 Everyone give it up for Greg Gorley.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
 Woohoo!

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
 Yeah, walk on in.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 Walk on in.

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
 Pushing that book cart.

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Pushing on in, Greg Gorley.

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,680
 Greg recently sent me a bunch of books and this is one of the most recent ones.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 Fantasyland.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,240
 How America Went Haywire by Kurt Anderson and basically it's a look at the myths, the

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,160
 conspiracy theories, the magical thinkers that have made up America's history.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,200
 So I'm really looking forward to this one.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,560
 Thank you so much Greg for sending it over.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
 You guys can't send me books.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
 You guys can't send me more books than my dear old mom who did buy me a bunch of books.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
 That's fine too.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I don't care.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,640
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 That helps out so much.

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
 I guess I shouldn't say I don't care because I do care.

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
 The people who do support the show financially, they help pay my rent and help me buy groceries.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,920
 But what I'm saying is I appreciate all of it and if you can't do it, that's fine.

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 That really is.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,040
 Greg, let's go ahead and talk to the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy we are leaving

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,160
 behind Dead Rabbit Command.

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:33,360
 Drive us all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,200
 Driving over the sandy dunes between here and there.

51
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,640
 I found this story post online.

52
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 It's one of the stories we don't have an exact location for.

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
 We don't have real names.

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
 We're gonna go ahead and call this person, this young woman.

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,600
 We're gonna call her Joan.

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,080
 Online she goes by the handle illustrator pretend 91.

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,760
 But she said about five or six years ago, so let's date the story back in 2018.

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,400
 Joan, she was living with her mother.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,440
 Joan was asleep in her bedroom and she is woken with a jolt.

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,640
 One of those, I don't know, she was actually breathing every time she was having an anxiety

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
 attack.

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,920
 No, it was one of those like sometimes you slowly wake up, this was, "Ugh, I'm awake."

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,640
 She was woken with a jolt and then in the darkness of her room she sees someone standing

64
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,940
 there.

65
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,680
 She said it was a man who had his back to her and he was wearing a flannel shirt.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,640
 And she said, "I honestly could perfectly describe to you the flannel pattern.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,960
 This shirt, for whatever reason, had basically left a scar across her memory."

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
 She woke up and she saw this.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,120
 I guess that would be pretty memorable, right?

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,640
 Waking up, there's a stranger in your room.

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,560
 She wakes up, there's a man in a flannel shirt facing away from her.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
 She goes, "I could describe the flannel shirt perfectly, but I'd never seen it before.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
 This wasn't anyone that I knew unless they just happened to buy a new flannel shirt that

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,800
 night and broke into my bedroom.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,080
 My friends aren't knowing to do that either."

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,680
 She goes, "I'd never seen the flannel shirt before, but I could describe it perfectly."

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
 Joan is in shock.

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,840
 She wakes up, she sees this man standing in her room and she doesn't really understand

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,920
 why she did this either, probably being in shock.

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,960
 She actually reached out towards the man.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,360
 Now the baseball bat, not with ninja throwing stars.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,960
 She reached out to touch him and he instantly vanished.

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,520
 So let's stop right here.

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
 That's not the end of the story, but I want to discuss this.

85
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,280
 There has been recent talk, and when I see recent, I really am talking like since 2018,

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,120
 2019, of a phenomenon known as the flannel man.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,200
 This is the flannel man.

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,880
 I came across it when I first, I'd never heard of it before.

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,840
 I came across it on early, early episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio.

90
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,720
 I remember the only source I could find was a podcast that had one or two mentions of

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 the flannel man.

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
 A couple of you guys recommended me covering the flannel man.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,520
 Basically the flannel man is the shadow man's hipster cousin.

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,400
 So he's like, "I'm not like the rest of you guys.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,600
 The rest of you nine foot tall interdimensional entities.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
 I have fashion sense."

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,600
 So he wears a flannel shirt.

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
 It seemed to kind of fall in that vein.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,760
 I've looked a little bit since then and I looked a little bit in preparation to the

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,160
 story and that's still, there's a big post on Reddit about the flannel man and yeah,

101
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,200
 yeah, so the flannel man, the first time I ever heard about it, the first time most people

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,240
 ever heard about it was on the Strange Familiars podcast.

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
 The flannel man.

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,920
 I wanted to address that, but this goes beyond that.

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,560
 This goes beyond just a man in a flannel shirt appearing out of the void.

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,520
 You're like, "Jayce, why don't you, that sounds absolutely fascinating."

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,640
 It does, but I mean like that's it.

108
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,080
 It's basically just like, it's basically just an interdimensional entity in a flannel

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 shirt.

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,720
 I love that I've, it's not the podcast that's made me blase about a bunch of other worldly

111
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,200
 stuff, it's just when you research stuff for 30 years, yeah, the flannel, like maybe if

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,480
 the flannel man like cursed people, now you can wear nothing but flannel, you're like,

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,080
 "No, I have a wedding tomorrow."

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,920
 Like, it needs to be a little more juicy for me.

115
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 That's my thing.

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,240
 If I saw the flannel man, it'd be like this story.

117
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,880
 This story was just the girl woke up, and this boy was just the girl woke up and there

118
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,800
 was a strange phantom wearing flannel in her bedroom.

119
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,120
 I honestly wouldn't have covered it.

120
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,440
 Not because I don't think she's telling the truth, not because I don't think the flannel

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 man exists, he might.

122
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 Right?

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,160
 There are probably enough people, enough different people have reported on it, but it's like,

124
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,760
 I want something else.

125
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,080
 I want that posass factor when it comes to the world of the paranormal.

126
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,360
 Flannel man though, I did want to address that there is a phenomenon known as that,

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,400
 but this is not, I mean it could be related, but that wouldn't be enough for me.

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,120
 I need something a little more spicy in my paranormal stew.

129
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,640
 A week later, Joan is once again woken up with a jolt.

130
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:55,160
 She is brought out of the deepest sleep to BAM reality in a heartbeat.

131
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:04,440
 In the same location where the flannel man was standing just a week ago, she woke up

132
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,360
 the first night, flannel man standing there, just being kind of laying, just standing there,

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
 wasn't killing anyone, wasn't possessing anyone.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,440
 She wakes up flannel man standing in her bedroom a week later in the same location where the

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 flannel man was.

136
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:32,720
 Now there was a tripod with a video camera on it recording her while she was sleeping.

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,320
 And she knows it's recording her because that little red light is shining in the darkness,

138
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,560
 that little red light that indicates that it is recording.

139
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,940
 So she thinks she's hallucinating.

140
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,240
 She thinks this isn't real, which I think would be a fair assumption.

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,800
 You would hope it wasn't real, right?

142
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,080
 If you woke up in the middle of the night and you realized someone was videotaping you,

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,360
 you'd be like, "Oh man, I hope it was all that old cheese I ate."

144
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,480
 She begins rubbing her eyes.

145
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,880
 She must just be seeing things wrong.

146
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 She rubs her eyes.

147
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,480
 She still sees the camera.

148
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,640
 She then slaps herself.

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
 Slaps herself, you know, feel that sensation.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 To wake her up, slap some sense into herself, the camera is still there.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,880
 She then talks out loud.

152
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
 She's basically testing her senses.

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
 It's very interesting.

154
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,720
 You know, if she has like a checklist that she normally does every morning, she wakes

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 up.

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 But you think about it, right?

157
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,400
 She's testing the sense of sight, hearing, touch when she slaps herself.

158
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,480
 The camera is still there, sitting on the tripod, recording her in the middle of the

159
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 night.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:02,680
 Joan then reaches over and turns on a lamp and the camcorder disappears.

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
 Joan says sense.

162
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,920
 I don't know if she's still doing it today.

163
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,640
 It might just be while she was living with her mom.

164
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,640
 But she said, "After those nights, she now does not sleep in the dark.

165
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,520
 She sleeps with the light on and that has never happened again."

166
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
 Now the Flannel Man is cool.

167
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,640
 Now the Flannel Man is into some dead rabbit radio stuff.

168
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
 I'm not trash talking strange familiars.

169
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,280
 Are there any other vikas that's covered the Flannel Man?

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
 I just want a little bit more.

171
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,960
 I'm not trash talking them.

172
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,080
 Don't send your strange familiars to come get me or maybe do it and it'll be more content

173
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
 for both of our podcasts.

174
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
 What in the world was this?

175
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
 I cannot think.

176
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
 And I could be wrong, right?

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,880
 I've been setting this stuff for 30 years.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,960
 We've put out over a thousand episodes.

179
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:00,480
 I cannot think of a time when a ghost has manifested technology.

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,080
 I'm not even fully convinced this is a ghost.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,880
 What's super interesting to me is when I first read this, and this is kind of the direction

182
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,200
 I'm still going in, we can say Flannel Man, Interdimensional Entity.

183
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,040
 We can say ghost because of the fact that it's appearing or disappearing.

184
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,320
 We could probably go alien.

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,440
 What I thought when I read this story, when she wrote this up, she titled it, "Has anyone

186
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
 experienced something similar before?"

187
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:38,320
 I titled it in my notes, "Truman Show Ghost."

188
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,080
 Because that's what it feels like.

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:54,880
 It feels like she somehow saw not the back rooms, but the backstage.

190
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,360
 I mean, we could really go eight dimensions with this thing.

191
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,160
 That what she saw, the guy in the Flannel shirt was just a guy working on the set of

192
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,120
 the newest show, Planet Earth.

193
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
 Or maybe it's a spin-off Jones' bedroom.

194
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
 I don't know.

195
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 Maybe it's a teenage drama.

196
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
 Who knows?

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
 I mean, that's what I thought.

198
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,960
 The video camera recording and the darkness, I can't think.

199
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,120
 And I could be wrong.

200
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,840
 Someone could probably send me an email.

201
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,040
 Something else we've covered on the show or something I've never heard of.

202
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
 I love getting stuff I've never heard of.

203
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,760
 But I can't think of another time that a ghost has manifested.

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,040
 Technology sure we can have like ghost motorcycles, ghost cars chasing people down the road.

205
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,760
 That is a phenomenon that's reported all over the world.

206
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,360
 But a ghost camcorder?

207
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,800
 I mean, I guess if you can manifest a stupefaker, you have trouble manifesting it.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 You have to manifest a Betamax.

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 But you know what I mean?

210
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,880
 The fact that it was in, that it was recording.

211
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
 Who was watching it?

212
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
 Who was recording it?

213
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,440
 Why, like to me, it was like a guy was on the set.

214
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,880
 She woke up in the middle of the night and the guy had his back to her because he's just

215
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,960
 like some stage hand, dude.

216
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
 You know how it's how Hollywood works?

217
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,120
 They're not allowed to look at the actors.

218
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,960
 They all have to face against the wall.

219
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,880
 What's the director's action?

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,520
 I mean, I feel like she almost looked through reality and saw that everything was a television

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
 show.

222
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,600
 To me, that's actually the most logical reason.

223
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,960
 The other option is Flannel Man is a huge pervert.

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,280
 Dude, wouldn't that be creepy actually?

225
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,400
 I just thought of that.

226
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,440
 What if ghosts, stay with me for a second guys.

227
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,960
 Stay with me.

228
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,480
 A lot of ghosts are filming human porn to sell to demons.

229
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,040
 Demons can't get enough of it.

230
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,160
 The ghosts are like, "Well, you know, I'm damned to walk the earth for a hundred years.

231
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,720
 I might as well make some money.

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,160
 I'm tired of manifesting only pennies.

233
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,760
 I want that money I can fold up."

234
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,560
 So they are videotaping humans, selling it to those pervert demons down in hell.

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 I don't know.

236
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,400
 I mean, I'm not even going to say that's a legit conspiracy theory.

237
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 That just popped in my head.

238
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,120
 That's the type of stuff that pops in my head.

239
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,560
 And admit it, that's the type of stuff that pops in your head too.

240
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,120
 But to me, that's what it feels like.

241
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
 It could be a ghost.

242
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
 It could be interdimensional.

243
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,560
 Even aliens, I don't think they're normally...

244
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,880
 I'm trying to think of...

245
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,000
 The aliens, we've come across stories with aliens recording humans.

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,080
 The devices are not human devices.

247
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,640
 It's always like a device that looked like a box that was recording the event.

248
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,320
 Or he hit a box, he hit like a circle on a box and it had a holographic display.

249
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,960
 I've never seen a great alien carting around a VHS camcorder in a story.

250
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
 Fascinating though.

251
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
 What was this?

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,040
 I mean, obviously, could have all been a dream, right?

253
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,920
 She's waking up in the middle of the night.

254
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
 But you know, it's a paranormal podcast.

255
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:12,280
 So ghost perverts selling porn to even more perverted demons.

256
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,360
 A flannel man.

257
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,840
 Is a flannel man would actually make sense because he's so hipster he would want to use

258
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
 a camcorder.

259
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,800
 She didn't specify, for all I know it was a red camera that this flannel man stole from

260
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,960
 the set of Avatar 2.

261
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,000
 She didn't actually say what type of camera was used.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,760
 But I just keep imagining that old camcorder I got from my graduation present that my

263
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,960
 uncle stole from me and sold for a crank jerk.

264
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
 Anyways, yeah, that's what I picture.

265
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,680
 That's what I picture when my uncle...

266
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,680
 That's a true story.

267
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,320
 He stole my camcorder and sold it to my crank.

268
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
 And maybe a ghost got it.

269
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,080
 Maybe it's been put to good use filming young women while they're sleeping for some interdimensional

270
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 television show.

271
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
 Who knows?

272
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
 A fascinating story.

273
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,720
 Like, that's a fair title for it.

274
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 Not mine.

275
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
 Hers.

276
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,000
 Has anyone experienced something similar before?

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,960
 And again, this is why I think a lot of paranormal stories don't get reported because what is

278
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
 this?

279
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,640
 Do you report this to a ghost researcher?

280
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,160
 Do you report this to a UFO researcher?

281
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
 Do you report this to...

282
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
 Who?

283
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,800
 Like, it is so bizarre.

284
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,280
 That's why I love it.

285
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,520
 Greg, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the world famous carbon helicopter we

286
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
 are leaving behind Joan.

287
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,640
 Fly us all the way out to New York.

288
00:16:31,640 --> 00:17:01,640
 DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADAD

289
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:27,640
 And

290
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:46,600
 like

291
00:17:46,600 --> 00:18:09,560
 we

292
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:39,400
 go

293
00:18:39,400 --> 00:19:09,200
 to

294
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
 the world.

295
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:39,000
 And

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 it's

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:20,400
 a

298
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,280
 moment.

299
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:49,080
 And

300
00:20:49,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 it's

301
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:41,280
 a

302
00:21:41,280 --> 00:22:04,480
 moment.

303
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:29,080
 It's a

304
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:54,680
 moment.

305
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:21,680
 Be

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:49,680
