00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 Today we meet a doctor who operates out of an RV and says that he's capable of performing almost any operation

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,720
 Because he learned at the best school of all YouTube

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,720
 Now we meet a man who believes that vaccines are actually full of tiny UFOs

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,880
 Why you ask because he believes that all germs are actually cryptids today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 *Music*

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800

 We are going to give one more shout out to Veronica the Haunted Doll. She is our co-host for this week

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,920
 She's always hanging out around the recording studio, but I got it right next to the mic. Let's hear it listen to her

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,640
 *Music*

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,640
 See that's Veronica saying what's up?

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,760
 That's Veronica's

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,520
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreon supporters right now Sergeant Clowney

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,200

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,240
 Really really helps the show grow sergeant clowny. Let's go ahead and hop in the dead rabbit dune buggy

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,320
 We haven't used that one in a while

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,800
 Jumping over sand dunes war pups chasing us the second we put the key in the war pups are right on us go sergeant clowny go go

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,080
 They're trying to throw bombs at us, but they suck they can't do it. We're headed out to Nevada

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,400
 That's why we want to have this dead rabbit dune buggy. We're headed out to the perpetual desert known as Nevada a lot of this information

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:55,240
 I got from an article on oxygen. It's a website called oxygen. It was written by Ali Vander Hayden

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,400
 So appreciate that one to give the journalist a shout out here. We're taking that dead rabbit dune buggy

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,440
 We're gonna go through a time travel cave and we're now in the year 2012

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,600
 We pull up outside of this broken down RV in the middle of nowhere a k a anywhere in Nevada

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,080
 And inside the RV right now is a young man. His name is Randy David Valenzuela, Jr.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,160
 Now Randy has HIV and he'd been taking a bunch of medication for it

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,960
 His doctor was like, okay, you know, this is treatable like we can at least keep you alive

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,000
 Right, that's no longer the death sentence that it used to be but you're gonna have to take this cocktail of pills

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,240
 But Randy wanted a cure Randy wanted things to change

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,000
 He was on the medication for seven years

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:51,160
 But he honestly believed that there was a cure out there somewhere and he finds the answer to that cure on Craigslist of all places

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,800
 Right on Craigslist. He meets a man named Rick van Thiel and he goes to this dirty old RV which should be your first

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 Sign that something's not right. The doctor says hey, yeah, come to my office. It's in the middle of nowhere

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,600
 You're gonna have to walk past five dead cats to get to it

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,160
 But there you go

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,100
 He walks into this RV and there is dr. Rick. It's the name he went by Rick van Thiel

39
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,560
 Rick van Thiel goes I can cure I can cure AIDS

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,040
 See the government doesn't want people to know that the cure for AIDS is out there because they make more money from selling the pharmaceuticals

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
 Then they are for treating it, but I've invented this thing called ozone therapy

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,960
 I'm gonna put these needles in your arm and then your blood gets sucked into this machine and it gets processed and it comes back

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,720
 And goes into your other arm totally works. It's a hundred and twenty dollars a day

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,080
 You have to do it for eight weeks straight and Randy's in Randy is ten toes into this thing

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,540
 He's like let's do it. So he actually goes through eight weeks of therapy and he feels better. He feels better afterwards

46
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,360
 He tells his mom about the doctor his mom is Dominguez Valenzuela. She's like oh, this doctor so amazing

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,020
 He can see he's curing HIV and the mom's like oh really can I meet him and

48
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,500
 he's like

49
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,660
 Well, yeah, but but don't judge a book by his cover show the mom goes there

50
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,340
 They show up to the trailer and the door opens up and dr. Rick's like hey, what's up? Randy awesome?

51
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,600
 You're here. You're here for your other treatment. Oh, is that your mom? Oh, it's so nice to meet you

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,400
 The mom's standing there and she's thinking wait a second. This is a doctor first off

53
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,040
 We're in the middle of nowhere. That's the worrisome thing number one two. He's operating out of an RV three

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,040
 Dr. Rick is completely naked

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,760
 Dr. Rick's medical office was also where he he made porn in there, which is great

56
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,520
 Right when you want to go get treated for assist

57
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,940
 You want to go have something pulled out of you? It's great to know that people were banging on the operating table right before you got there

58
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,260
 He shot porn there. He actually like when the police so you know where this story is going when the police go into the place

59
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,580
 There's like shelves of medical supplies

60
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,740
 It's just stuff randomly shrewn about and then porn videos on top of the medical supply if you're lucky

61
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,500
 porn videos on top of the medical supplies there are also sex toys everywhere

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,880
 So again like going to the doctor's not the most comfortable thing to begin with but imagine if you walked into your doctor's

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,580
 Office and you sit down and you're like whoa wait what I sit on and there's like a plug there

64
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,360
 There's like a french tickler. You're like what you're trying different chairs. You're like oh this one this one's kind of comfortable

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,380
 It's a porn studio

66
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,100
 Doctors office in the middle of nowhere when the police eventually do show up one of the detectives said it reminded him of a saw movie

67
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,100
 There was so much not like blood on the walls, but he said there was so much like just bloody stuff around bloody tools

68
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,380
 Hopefully again just bloody tools that the cops like hey dude come over here look at this the other cops like nah

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,400
 Nah, the dude's like pointing out a box that's labeled sex toys is like no if you thought that was bloody cost like no no no no

70
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,300
 Seriously, I'm about to quit. I don't want to look. I don't want to know what's in that box

71
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,640
 So what happens is well, let's back up a little bit

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:03,920
 Randy takes another HIV test and it comes up negative now apparently one out of every 12 like self-administered tests for HIV

73
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,860
 Comes back negative. It's a pretty high percentage for very very serious illness, right?

74
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,960
 So he thinks he's cured there is no cure for it

75
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,380
 Unfortunately, he thinks he's cured and then he contracts it again or really he just he took another test and it showed that

76
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,800
 He still had it so he begins going back to dr. Ricks and

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,160
 He starts doing the treatment again, but the mom's like it was different the second time like he didn't have him come every day

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,360
 It was just a totally different setup

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,300
 Randy passes away three weeks later after visiting dr. Rick again

80
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,360
 And so the mom alerts authorities to what's going on there now

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,900
 He didn't get charged with Randy's death because he didn't do any like Randy died of complications due to I think it was drug abuse

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,740
 because he was using meth it was like drug abuse and

83
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,600
 Just HIV it was a bad combination

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,980
 So the cops go because you can't practice medicine without a license the cops go to the place they see the mess

85
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,440
 They obviously know that it's not legal the ozone machine that was pumping blood in and out of this dude

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,880
 He wouldn't clean so if you had hepatitis C and he's like oh, I know how to cure that ozone

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,680
 You weren't getting blood that was HIV infected. You're like oh, I have a serious case of the munchies

88
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,640
 I probably shouldn't smoke all that weed. He's like oh, I have a cure for the munchies ozone therapy

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
 He used this machine for everything

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,080
 Bloody tools would be used on one person that person would leave and then another person would show up

91
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,300
 You get hepatitis C get all sorts of horrible disease HIV all sorts of horrible diseases from this place

92
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,760
 There's a video of him on YouTube. It's disgusting. I watched it. He's naked

93
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,980
 They don't show anything but they show him take his clothes off and he removes a cyst from a guy's back and the guys like ow

94
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,580
 ow ow ow ow ow ow and the doctor's like just hold it he's like

95
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,540
 Pops it out looks like a little chicken nugget popping out of this dude totally on YouTube this guy

96
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,560
 It's a video and he said he goes the way

97
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,440
 I know how to do all these procedures is I watched the procedures on YouTube and then he knows how to do it

98
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,360
 He was performing abortions here

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,000
 So basically any possible procedure you could think of you need a tooth pulled there you go

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,980
 You need a film you need to film a porn there you go

101
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,760
 It was a one-stop shop for everything now

102
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,380
 He was a believer of the sovereign citizen movement, which is basically this super bizarre movement

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,460
 Where your name is actually a corporation name and the government

104
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,420
 I don't even know if I can explain it in less than three minutes

105
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,440
 The when you are born your your name is spelt in all caps

106
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,460
 Which makes you a corporation and then the government then takes a loan out against the corporation of Jason Carpenter

107
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,940
 So if I file it means one of two things one

108
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,460
 There's a secret code that if I file some court paperwork and say the right things in court

109
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,480
 The government goes oh great. He figured it out and I get all the money

110
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,620
 That's been accumulated under my corporation. That's one weird part of it. The second weird part is

111
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,760
 You don't believe that laws really apply to you because you never agreed to become a US citizen

112
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,080
 You were born on US soil, but you never signed a contract or became a US citizen

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,220
 So a lot of times you can watch YouTube videos. They don't believe that they're driving through town. They'll be in a car

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,860
 They're not in a cloud car. They're not caribabers floating around like they are actually driving through a town

115
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,820
 But when they get stopped by the police they go I'm not driving

116
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,300
 I'm traveling and apparently in the Constitution like you can't be stopped when you're traveling or people have a right to travel

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,820
 So they believe the right combination of words will get them out of trouble

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,700
 Those videos almost always end with cops busting their windows open and pulling them out of the car

119
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,660
 So it doesn't really work that well, but he was one of these guys

120
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,180
 He was one of these guys who believes in the sovereign citizen movement

121
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,160
 So he didn't believe that he needed a license YouTube was good enough for him

122
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,960
 He'd watch a YouTube video on sister move all and then remove a cyst

123
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,560
 But I'm wondering if there was a weird like cycle where he just started watching his own video of him removing his cyst

124
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,000
 And he's like oh this guy's awesome. He's naked and he knows that oh, that's me

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,640
 Then he just goes in and starts popping cysts out of people

126
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,520
 He ends up getting arrested and then he hangs himself in jail before he can serve time

127
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,040
 He wasn't facing murder charges for this guy

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:16,580
 But he was definitely facing a lot of time for practicing without a license and doing it so many times and recording evidence of it

129
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,020
 So it's try obviously. I think that's a tragic ending. I don't like when people kill themselves

130
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,780
 He probably would have done like five or ten years and gotten out, but he was also kind of old at the time

131
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,860
 So still still though he ended up hanging himself in 2017

132
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,980
 So that's the story of dr. Rick. He needed a procedure done. There you go 120 bucks. You couldn't I mean you're probably

133
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,700
 Here's the thing with that sure you get the cyst removed, but then you're like the couple days later

134
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,380
 You're like oh, why are my eyes yellow? They're like oh you come in you got you got jaundice you got jaundice

135
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,120
 I don't know probably totally unrelated to my bloody tools, but here you go come back in we'll fix that

136
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,880
 So then he's pumping out your jaundice blood and you're like oh, I feel so much better now and couple days later

137
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,400
 You're like oh, why do I have the avian flu doctors like oh, I don't know I don't know

138
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,460
 There's a bunch of birds. There's a bunch of birds waiting in the in the waiting room reading magazines

139
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,760
 He's like I don't know but come back. We'll cure as we actually not think about it. It's actually a really good

140
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,460
 That's a really good scheme what you do is you treat the patient for the illness

141
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,740
 They have but give them a new illness and you just keep that cycle going you just keep it going and and

142
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,820
 While you're there you could be like so you like movies and you're like yeah sure

143
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,420
 I mean could you just get this cyst out of my back and cure the ten other diseases

144
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,320
 I've gone recently like yeah, yeah, yeah, but to relax. Let's put on this movie

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,160
 So you're like slaying there you can't move you're getting cysts removed and you have to watch one of his porn movies that actually

146
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 It's funny. Let me wrap it up like this

147
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,080
 I forgot to say this detail they found when the cops are investigating this they're getting a bunch of people to come forward

148
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,920
 Women were saying oh, we didn't have to pay

149
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,480
 Sometimes we would just have sex with him and he would perform the procedure for free

150
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,320
 And you're like okay, you know fine, whatever and then they go on on on on no sometimes

151
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,360
 He would have sex with us while performing the procedure

152
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,900
 I don't care if he's a sexy as a woman on the planet if I'm removing cysts from you while we're making love

153
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,340
 If you can't hear that that's just me shaking my head there is no way

154
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:27,640
 Anyone could do that apparently this guy could but he would have sex with women while performing procedures

155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,040
 I hope I really hope I actually looked for some of this guy's porn movies and I couldn't find them

156
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,960
 And and I'm very very thankful of that. I was trying to do my due diligence

157
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,560
 I said there must be some of these videos out there because he made a bunch of them

158
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
 They showed clips of them on the news

159
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,300
 What medical procedure could you possibly do and at the same time have sex with a woman? I

160
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,160
 I'm not even gonna even gonna think about that. So instead

161
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,860
 Sergeant clowny. He's like he's already in the carbonic after he's trying to get the buddies like cologne work work

162
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,400
 Okay, wait for us wait for us. We're leaving behind this little shack in Nevada. We are headed out to

163
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,160
 Helicopters flying around we are headed out to a little field

164
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:22,280
 We land it's nothing but grass grass as far as the eye can see we all step out of the carbonic hopter

165
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,080
 We look it's beautiful out here the skies blues couple white clouds in the sky birds flying around we're like, oh great

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,160
 They're like, you know where doctor we can go to

167
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,880
 We got cysts. We're like sorry dude birds fly away and as we're sitting in this grass field

168
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,080
 I turn to you. I have a podium and I walk up to it and I go

169
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,200
 New today on digital and Haitian Thomas Jane starring the gripping psychological thriller the vanished

170
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:56,000
 Directed by Peter Fastinelli a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover that the young daughter has vanished without a trace

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,520
 Stopping at nothing to find her the search for the truth leads to a shocking revelation

172
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:08,120
 Where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller own or rent the vanished on digital today and watch it at home tonight

173
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,720
 Raided are from paramount pictures

174
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,560
 So I step off the podium and now we're standing in this field of grass

175
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,080
 We're sitting in this grass field though because of this post I want to talk about now

176
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,840
 Recently AZ sent me to the reddit for gang stalking and I was like, oh my god

177
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,840
 This is so insane and I did a story about a guy who was being gangstalked by his own family

178
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,400
 It's like this is nuts and then like anyone who ever finds anything on the internet

179
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:44,440
 They realize that that it's never truly the end Chris founder of the golden rabbit brigade a longtime supporter of the show

180
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,520
 Chris sends me a link. He goes. Oh, yeah gang stalking, right? That's a thing

181
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,840
 But have you heard of gang stalking MK ultra subreddit? And I was like I have not I

182
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,520
 Have not good sir. So I pulled it up and it wouldn't make the people in the gang stalking subreddit blush

183
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,600
 It's so insane

184
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,000
 There is a guy from gang stalking MK ultra who's now posting on

185
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,960
 Gangstalking subreddit and people are like you're crazy. That's how nuts this stuff is

186
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:20,680
 So, thank you Chris and thank you AZ both you guys for turning me on to this crazy subreddit world on the gang stalking MK ultra subreddit

187
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,680
 There's a username. Don't chill me bro. The last time that this account posted anything was about three years ago

188
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,000
 I believe they're still posting under different a different name, but we'll get into that later

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,440
 But right now let's take a look at this. So

190
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,520
 This is from a post labeled a theory germs are cryptids

191
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,440
 You're like that is actually an interesting conspiracy theory

192
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,320
 It's not so far off from monkeys don't exist or that mountains are really trees like you you get a sense of it right from the beginning

193
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,400
 Germs are cryptids. They're too small for us to really see it's one of those things that we take

194
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,040
 Scientist advice on what they are because we don't know they're looking through the microscope and they're like hmm

195
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,160
 It appears that the virus is multiplying at a rapid rate and we're like can we see and he's like no no

196
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,840
 This is my microscope. You can't see you got to bring your own you got to find your own viruses

197
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,400
 We have to take them out their words. So germs are cryptids are actually a very interesting conspiracy theory, but that's not all

198
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,800
 It's not all that would actually be enough. I would be really interested to see just someone explore that not this guy

199
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 Not this guy. So that's promising right? That's very promising conspiracy theory. Let's see what this guy has to say about germs are cryptids

200
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,520
 Quote I had a realization when you wear fur or sleep on the grass and wake up itchy for about 15 minutes

201
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,800
 It's 1500 years while everyone builds swords and chases aliens

202
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 Stand in the middle of the middle of this grassy field

203
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,440
 And you look at me and you go way way way wait what what is any of that have to do with your weight?

204
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,000
 How do you even parse that out at all? Let me read this again now that the shock factor is worn off

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,240
 This is a real sentence a human constructed. I had a realization when you wear fur or sleep on the grass and

206
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:14,520
 Wake up itchy for about 15 minutes. It's 1500 years while everyone builds swords and chases aliens

207
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,160
 And you go Jason. That's obviously taken out of context. You're reading the first sentence of this post

208
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,480
 He must clarify that and so what does that mean? So when you fall asleep on the grass?

209
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,520
 Let's break it down when you wear fur when you're putting on fur or when you fall asleep in the grass

210
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,120
 After about 15 minutes, you'll start itching which we know is caused by chiggers

211
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,240
 It's little bugs in the grass that bite you and make you itch

212
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,880
 but he's saying that if you wear fur or you sleep in the grass what actually happens is

213
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,160
 1500 years passes and

214
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,120
 Society evolves where everyone starts building swords and fighting aliens at least like that's what I'm thinking saying, okay?

215
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,040
 So there's like there's 15 minutes in our world and then 1500 years and in other world where this is going on

216
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,960
 What is this has to do with germs? I'm not for sure, but this is literally his first sentence in this passage

217
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,160
 So then he goes on to say you can test it for yourself

218
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
 You can test this theory for yourself

219
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,800
 There's actually a bunch of nonsense in between there. He talks about icillipho pods which aren't real a

220
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,880
 Cellophopod is a mollusk like an octopus but then he has a picture of this weird like monster and

221
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,120
 keeps calling it an icillipho pod and then says I don't know what it is

222
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,800
 So I'm actually skipping I'm skipping some of the nonsense because some of it's just so random

223
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,520
 He starts talking about goat men and deer wear fur and maybe that's why we itch

224
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,120
 It's like some genetic thing. We're not related to gomen or we're the gomen don't exist

225
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,160
 So we're definitely not related to them, but we're not related to deer either

226
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,000
 So I'm actually sparing you some of the insanity. It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense at all. What in the world?

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Dude, where's a goat man coming out in this? I love it too because he goes this is that this is the next sentence

228
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
 I'll read you this

229
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,280
 This is the next sentence after he talks about 15 minutes. It's 1500 years

230
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,280
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

231
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:24,560
 So for example goat man maybe and actual deer are from wearing fur or the genetic memory of such what does that mean?

232
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:32,120
 What does that mean and it's great that you're even saying I don't know maybe the goman's involved

233
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,200
 I don't know. I don't know you gotta ask the goman. What is a goat man? Is it chupacabra?

234
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,520
 Is it a satyr? Is it who is the goat man? I was wondering I imagine it's some sort of actual cryptid

235
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
 But then it's just a deer

236
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:54,340
 It's just a deer running around but apparently there's some sort of genetic myth. I've never I don't think I've ever worn fur

237
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:01,680
 I have worn fur actually in plays in costumes and I've worn fur for hours. I've never itched

238
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,220
 But anyways, so let's get back. There's more nonsense, but let's get to

239
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,360
 There's here's the thing there's nonsense and then there's nonsense that kind of makes sense

240
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 And I could just read off nonsensical phrases all day long, but it's just mind-numbing

241
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 It's totally mind-numbing. Let me move to a part where it this part

242
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 Okay, this part at least makes a little bit of sense now

243
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,640
 You know where in the middle of a grass field because he goes you can test it for yourself

244
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,400
 You can test this theory about goat men and deer and grass

245
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,120
 Here you go quote

246
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,600
 sleep on the grass with no shirt and

247
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,960
 When you think about your back think put it here

248
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,280
 Eventually you will get a sand flea

249
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,920
 Which I don't know that is maybe that's another term for a chigger but

250
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,240
 And when you think about your back think put it here

251
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,720
 So you're you're commanding something to get on your back

252
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,040
 When you think about your back think put it here eventually you will get a sand flea or dinosaur

253
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
 or something

254
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,000
 There's a huge difference obviously

255
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,200
 Do I have to explain this there's a huge difference between a flea a flea on my back and a triceratops

256
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,920
 So you can get a sand flea or a dinosaur or something or nothing really is what's gonna happen

257
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,240
 But let's continue here. You have itch. I'm not gonna complain about the grammar

258
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,320
 I'm not gonna complain about the grammar in this post because so much of it doesn't make sense anyways

259
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
 You're already laying on our backs

260
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
 Thinking put it here and then dinosaurs show up. That's mind-boggling enough

261
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,000
 That's mind-boggling enough that someone could write that and go that'll work that that makes sense

262
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,840
 Here's the rest of it

263
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,160
 You think yeah sand flea or dinosaur or something and you have itch for about 15 minutes

264
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,840
 After it stops itching

265
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,160
 Think about what you were thinking about on your back. So I want you okay. So that's perfect

266
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,640
 We'll pause here before we move on to what he says

267
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,080
 You've been laying on your back. You say put it here something is on your back now most likely just grass

268
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,360
 Maybe a dinosaur we're laying all here for 15 minutes. What are you thinking of?

269
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,140
 Here's what he goes after it stops itching think about what you were thinking about on your back

270
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,240
 swords and caves

271
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:32,040
 So apparently that's where he's getting the 15 minutes to 1500 year time jump where

272
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,480
 When he's on his back 1500 years have passed at some point and I don't know in human history in that time period

273
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,320
 But apparently when he lay wherever he lays down he thinks of swords and caves

274
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,600
 I'll tell you this right now

275
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,960
 I'm not a psychoanalysis dude at any way shape or form. I've never been trained in it. That is sexual, right?

276
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,000
 Like that's just armchair psychology 101 swords and caves whenever he lays down

277
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,120
 He's like oh, yeah, my sword my sword is going in and out of that cave

278
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,160
 I remember once I came across something a long time ago and it said people who fantasize might have mentioned this before on the show

279
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,360
 People who fantasize about hiding underground want to crawl back into their mom's womb

280
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,360
 And then I was thinking oh man. I was thinking about all I was thinking about all the times

281
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,120
 I was like dude if zombies ever attack I'm gonna have like an underground bunker

282
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,760
 So like the zombies can't bust down a door if there's no door

283
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,240
 It's just like an underground bunker or like the cops are surrounding my place. They're like you're way too cool, bro

284
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,680
 We're gonna like blow you up and I'm like no way cops and then I like run

285
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,800
 They're the cool police. I run and I hide in a bunker

286
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,000
 I've always thought about hiding in bunkers, and then I'm like oh great. Thanks psychoanalysis guy

287
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I gotta figure out another place from zombies actually by the time zombies attack. I'm not gonna care what that guy thinks

288
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,800
 I'm not gonna be like all my let zombies eat me. Just no one thinks I'm a pervert

289
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,520
 At least at least no one thinks that I'm weird is there ripping my limbs one for one. I'm going in that bunker, dude

290
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,000
 I'm going in that bunker, but that's me

291
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,520
 I'm gonna this guy because if every time you lay down you think of swords and caves

292
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,360
 That's definitely sexual and then he says then he says this you can cure this you can cure this what we're curing

293
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,880
 I don't know. I'm assuming we're trying to cure the germ remember when this started off with germs or cryptids

294
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,160
 Then it wasn't that a nice quaint conspiracy theory. Here's here's where we're going quote you can train it

295
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,060
 Practice making the cure faster and faster. What are we?

296
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,180
 What's going faster and faster is the sword in and out of the cave that's okay?

297
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:43,100
 So I'm not let's not imagining the swords in the caves dude, but what cure are you talking about you can train it

298
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,840
 Practice making the cure faster and faster you can talk to the people all I show my back

299
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,480
 Ankle's is to claws coming out of a cave and they go get it. What are you talking about?

300
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,880
 So he's walking down the street, right? He's no longer laying on his back

301
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,480
 He's walking on the street and he sees people and he's like hey guys look at my look at my calves

302
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,100
 Look at him people on the street like what and the guys like uh-huh. Yeah, they see the claws in the cave

303
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,360
 Then he walks away people like what is going on?

304
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,600
 They're cured. They've been cured. They've been cured of all their diseases all I show is my back or ankles is to claws coming out of a cave

305
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,440
 And they get it some people so here now we're gonna get back into

306
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,720
 The germ stuff we're slowly becoming sane again

307
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,200
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds mine takes about a minute if you don't have swords

308
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,080
 It'll take 1,000 years

309
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,760
 so

310
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
 I

311
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,040
 Don't know

312
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,760
 Even me it almost feels like a coded message

313
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,280
 It almost seems like there's some guy in

314
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,000
 Washington DC and some CIA headquarters and he saw this on red and he's like it's a go guys

315
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 We know where was Thomas at?

316
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,760
 Helicopters flying out like it's so random. It seems like it's some sort of code

317
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,320
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds. What germ he still hasn't explained

318
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,600
 Is it the back ankle claw germ? We don't know or is it all germs? We don't know but anyways

319
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,240
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds mine. It takes about a minute if you don't have swords

320
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 It'll take a thousand years

321
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,640
 He does clarify that it's maybe not a thousand years

322
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,680
 He does say that he says you know some people can do it in less than five seconds takes him a minute

323
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,800
 Some people a thousand years and then he goes maybe ten minutes or so

324
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,520
 So you know one of the other thousand years ten minutes either one at this point

325
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,200
 Sand fleas dinosaurs it doesn't matter at least he gives us that option right that's gonna be my new timeline whenever someone says

326
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,400
 Hey, can you wait ten minutes? I'll be like I could wait a thousand years and I'm gonna point at my ankle

327
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,760
 So he ends it like this we started off so strong with germs or cryptids. So we started this off

328
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,120
 Then we get to these last two sentences, but then when you find out it's true

329
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,840
 You realize vaccines are little UFOs and we're screwed

330
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,340
 That is such a good conspiracy theory dude like it's not true obviously

331
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,740
 But that is a conspiracy theory that could catch on germs or cryptids I could see people believing in that

332
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,540
 Vaccines contain UFOs dude. That is so timely right now

333
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,360
 Do you imagine pushing that conspiracy theory that aliens a little microscopic little flying saucers

334
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,940
 Floating around in your bloodstream and when you look at photos the white blood cells of those are actually like

335
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,340
 UFOs that's why they look like little plates little floating around in you and stuff like that

336
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,400
 Oh, dude, there's so much wasted potential because that is a legit

337
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,560
 Really good conspiracy theory someone can build off of germs or cryptids germs are in in this sense

338
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,520
 You would say like they're cryptids. There's something that don't exist that shouldn't exist naturally

339
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,520
 It's an undiscovered creature we refer to all these germs as if it's some sort of biological thing

340
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,120
 But it's still some on the border of paranormal. It has a physical body, but it's it's ghostly in some way

341
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,440
 That's such a good conspiracy theory and then vaccines actually contain miniature UFOs by getting the vaccine

342
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,720
 You're getting an alien invasion in your bloodstream. Come on. That's good stuff

343
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,840
 And it's so wasted because he's talking about goat men and dinosaurs and swords and caves

344
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,720
 And he it's like even he knows even he knows that that's a good conspiracy theory because that's not how he ends off this rant

345
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,680
 He doesn't end off saying oh, you know that vaccines have UFOs in them. That's great

346
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,440
 Do you have anything else to tell us and then he says so how close do you live to the swamp?

347
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,800
 What in the world

348
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,760
 What does that mean

349
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,860
 What is it have to do with anything? There was no buildup to it at all

350
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,400
 He's talking about laying in grass and now he's asking me how close I live to the swamp or pond. He also says, you know ponds as well

351
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:07,520
 Dude this guy is almost like the Nikola Tesla of conspiracy theories like

352
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:15,240
 When they ask you a little too much credit, but you see a glimmer of genius in it germs are cryptids

353
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,040
 Oh, I love that

354
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,000
 Vaccines contain UFOs. I love that but everything else is so much nonsense

355
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,560
 I almost feel like this is what it can this is like the in the look inside of someone whose brain has been so fractured by conspiracy theories

356
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:36,260
 They can't even spout out conspiracy theories anymore. Well, they can but it's mixed it was so much nonsense

357
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,740
 So much white noise that I mean this post was four years ago and it had like zero comments

358
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,020
 Obviously who's gonna comment on this right this guy's gonna hunt you down put you in a vaccine

359
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,700
 Shrinking you down. I guess if he has that technology

360
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,800
 Then he doesn't need to really do it if you're that level of genius, you don't need to be stringing people down other than you just want to but

361
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,340
 fascinating

362
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:07,040
 Stuff very very fascinating stuff a fractured mind may actually see a bit of the truth

363
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,960
 This is a possible that germs viruses bacteria

364
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,600
 Aren't what we think they are

365
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,600
 There's something darker evil. There's something that evolved over time

366
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,160
 We used to fear werewolf and Dracula, but now the real monsters are hidden

367
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,420
 Everywhere we breathe them in every minute. We pick them up when we touch contaminated surfaces

368
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:39,940
 We can do our best our bodies are still invaded with a cryptid with a monster with a creature that wants to destroy us

369
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:47,800
 But nowadays you can't use the crucifix to stop them. No silver bullet can destroy a bacteria

370
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,080
 The only thing we can do is look to our intergalactic neighbors and ask for help

371
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,680
 The aliens are more than willing to help is they shrink a fleet of UFOs

372
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,840
 To fit into a hypodermic needle the close encounter doesn't come with the UFO in the countryside

373
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
 it comes as a

374
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:14,000
 Armada of alien starships flies around your liver slowly blowing up little goat man germs who have built a camp on

375
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:21,560
 Your left rib cage. It is a war not of the world. It is a war of survival

376
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,680
 Aliens versus cryptids

377
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,360
 dinosaurs versus

378
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,200
 And all of it is happening inside the human body

379
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,640
 Sometimes the worst monster isn't the boogeyman under your bed

380
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,920
 Sometimes the worst monster isn't even man himself. The worst monster is what is inside of us

381
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,480
 So there you go next time you go to your doctor look around be thankful

382
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,160
 They're not also porn stars the next time you go to your doctor. Just think

383
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,000
 Just thank them and say thank you for putting the aliens in my body

384
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,360
 Because otherwise

385
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
 Well, who knows what would happen?

386
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,600
 That doctor will look at you with a knowing nod a wink and then he'll turn around and

387
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
 Point at his ankle
