1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Ancient graffiti shows that bullies are thousands of years old.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 A man is arrested for preparing for the end of the world.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we travel to Mount Hood in Oregon, not far from where I live,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 where a woman tells the tale of when her and her husband were out camping

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 and they were stalked by a telepathic bear today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We're headed up to the end of season 8.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Every 50 episodes I take a week off, so that's coming up.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Next week is going to be some best of episodes.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I have a lot. I already have the episodes picked out.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I think there are a lot of cool ones.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 They mostly focus on conspiracy theories that I've come up with.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Ones that I've kind of pieced together.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So yeah, I really liked that week.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I think one of them doesn't fit that category.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's just an episode I really, really like.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Conspiracy theory, I spent a lot of time researching over the years.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So yeah, it's a good set of Dead Rabbit Radio classics.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And then we'll be back with season 9, starting off with episode 401.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Can you believe that?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Guys, again, I like to give you guys encouragement.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I started this show in what?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I don't even remember. 2018.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What's it now? 2020?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Yeah, the show's been on for about a year, year and a half now.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And I was just some dude sitting at home,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 really not happy with the direction of my life.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And I just started doing this.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I really had no experience doing it.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And I just did it.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And you guys found the show and have made it 100% worthwhile.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And I think back all the time to how miserable I was

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 before I started this endeavor.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And how much of my life has changed because of it.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 In a good way.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Nothing but positive things have come out of this show.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I just hope to encourage you guys that if you guys are struggling

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 with anything in your lives right now,

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 take that chance to make that change.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Take that chance to do something that you've always been wanting to do

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 or something that you've been afraid to do.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I want to see your lives get better too.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Because yeah, it's been an amazing--

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I mean, think about it, dude.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We're coming up to episode 400 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Couldn't have done it without you guys.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And I've loved it every step of the way.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 My fluffle, my fluffle gang, my group of wild rabbits.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You guys are awesome.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 before I get too emotional and start hugging you.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 We're first going to Palatine Hill in Rome.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So we're going to take--

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Do we have an off-road vehicle?

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 A Jason jumper or some sort of Dead Rabbit dune buggy

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 or something like that?

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Whatever. We're there.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We're ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 We're going to Palatine Hill.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Now, back in this time period, there was this imperial palace.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 That's the fan of the opera music.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I was trying to make it sound like old Egyptian music,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 but that is a new fit.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 What would Roman music be?

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The big old horns.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And there's a bunch of page boys running around.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And there's this imperial palace.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 That's just not something that's randomly happening.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 The imperial palace and next to it is a school for page boys.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And nowadays, this stuff is all archaeological stuff

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 that we've dug up.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You're like, Jason, I know how history works.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But back then, it was actually a palace.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 It wasn't covered up by dirt.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So we were walking around and we see this dude.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 His name is Aleximos.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And he's getting pushed around.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Everyone's like, Christian, Christian, Christian.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Like booing him.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And he's like, oh, no, I'm sorry.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I believe in Jesus Christ.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And they're like, boo this man to throw in tomatoes at him.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And he's like, ah.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And so he's like all sad.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Everyone believes in the power of Jesus Christ.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And they're picking on me.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I'm so sad.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And he's walking through the page boys school.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 We don't know how old Aleximos is,

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 but we'll say he's like 12 or whatever.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 So Aleximos is walking through the page boys school.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And he sees this carved into the wall.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It's a picture of him, dressed as a Roman guard.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And he's like, aww.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Because he knows where this is going.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And then it's a carving of a cross with a man crucified.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And he has the head of a donkey.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And I mentioned this on Monday's episode.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 A donkey worshiper was a slang term for a Christian,

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 which I'm sure some of you now may have caught on.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Like some of you may have started using that in real life,

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 being like, I'm a donkey worshippers.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Them a luma donkey.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But they believe that was an early, early slang word for a Christian.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It was a donkey worshiper because Jesus rode into one of the towns.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I'm not a biblical scholar,

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 but famously rode into a town and the Jews were kind of throwing flowers at his feet.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And he had on this little crown and he was riding a donkey.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And that's when the ruling class, look at each other and they're like,

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 "Uh oh, the Jews are really starting to worship this guy.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 This cult leader."

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Look at that.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 We got all these people.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Basically he was this messiah.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And we can't have that.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He's shaking things up.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Take them out.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Get that cross ready boys.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So there's a picture of a cross with a dude and a donkey head.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And it says underneath it,

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 which is, this is honestly kind of funny.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It says underneath it, "Aleximos worships his God."

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And the little Aleximos is watching this and he's like,

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 "My God's not a donkey head, man.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's Lord Savior.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He's the Son of God, man."

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 He runs away crying.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now we've discovered it's interesting because

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 we obviously know bullings existed through modern times.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 It's interesting to think that people were doing this back in 200 AD.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And people were not--

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 graffiti was much harder back then.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You had to carve into walls.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 There were no spray paint or pins.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 They really had to commit to the bullying back then.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 They're like, "I'll show you."

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Imagine having to write like a manifesto back then.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 You're all chink, chink, chink, chink.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 You're just like, slow.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 You're like, "Okay, I give up after page four."

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 They really must have not liked this guy.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 What happened was in 1857--

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 so this building had completely eventually got over--

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 just got buried over mud flood, I guess, basically.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Actually, you know, 1857 was supposedly before the mud flood.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Anyways, the building got completely--

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I just buried archaeologically dirt,

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 all the dirt moving from everywhere.

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 It got rediscovered and they find this room

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 that used to be to this Page Boy school.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 They find this drawing still in the wall in 1857.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's preserved, I believe, you can see it today.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 But back then, you could see this drawing, this photograph of it.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You know, now we're looking back.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 200 AD, this kid was being teased for his religious beliefs,

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 which is never cool, right?

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 You never want to tease people over their religious beliefs.

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 That's a deeply held thing.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So, you know, and it's even worse when it's like a kid or something like that.

164
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But who knows?

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 This dude could have been 32 and he could have just been one of the teachers of the Page Boy school.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I don't know.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The point is that he was getting teased for his religious beliefs.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 But a little bit of sunshine,

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 a little bit of sunshine for a little Aleximos.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Because, one, nobody will remember the names of the bullies.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 They have disappeared unless one of his roommates was like,

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I don't know, Nero or something like that.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 But for the most part, no one will remember his bullies.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 He's remembered, Aleximos.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And in the next room over,

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 they discovered another piece of graffiti that someone carved into the wall.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Aleximos the faithful.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And faith is standing up for your beliefs, even though they're being ridiculed.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So, good on you, Aleximos.

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Good on you.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 You have become immortalized as the symbol of faith in the test of bullying

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and no one remembers who bullied you,

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 but you've been remembered 1,800 years later.

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Let's go ahead, though, and move on to someone who probably didn't make super good decisions,

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 although his faith was also equally as strong.

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Let's drive the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 We're going to drive it up to Dunn and Scotland.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Dunn and Scotland?

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Now, there's not a lot of dirt in Scotland.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's all like grass and stuff, right?

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So, we're just going to tear up there.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 We're doing circles in the...

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I'll find some sacred site.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 We're doing wheelies.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You're like, "Jason, did you just give a lecture on not bullying people further beliefs?"

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, but technically..."

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 This doesn't count.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 [imitates noise]

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 A bunch of druids are chasing us away.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "Eat our dirt, druids!"

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 [imitates noise]

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 They suck.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You're like, "Jason, you're such a jerk."

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I know.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 That's what makes me charming.

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So, anyway, I'll buy the druids some Guinness.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Come on.

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Wait, is that from Ireland?

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 It doesn't matter.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Druids come with us.

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They're on their own robes.

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 They're hanging out with us now.

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 We're at a bar.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 You can tell how happy I am about this.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Now, I'm going to buy a bunch of druids alcohol.

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Just because I was a hypocrite.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 The year is 2018.

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 It's in December.

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We're in Dunn and Scotland.

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 There's a dude named James Carson.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 He's 36 years old.

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 He's sitting at home watching some Scottish television.

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And all of a sudden, cops are at the war and...

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 [imitates gunshot]

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 ...door gets busted and they come in.

226
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Guns ready.

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Get down, get down, get down.

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Push them onto the ground.

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 You guys know it.

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 You guys have seen police procedural shows or have been arrested or both.

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 In his house, they find bombs.

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Now, depending on your definition, James says they're just firework tubes that he took apart and put back together.

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The prosecutors said they are actually IEDs.

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 They're cardboard tubes filled with gunpowder, ball bearings, and wires connecting it all.

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But anyways, cardboard...

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I think, you know, cardboard tube, that's just going to disintegrate.

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It seems like it could make more of a loud noise and do any sort of damage.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I guess that's what the ball bearings were for.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Generally, IEDs are made with like metal or PVC pipe.

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Preferably metal.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Well, actually, preferably don't make IEDs.

242
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 But if you find yourself in a red-dawn, Wolverine-esque situation,

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 you're not going to really win by shooting bottle rockets at people.

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And this guy is also found with an air rifle that's been modified to be more powerful than the standard air rifle.

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 This will shoot out both your eyes.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Cops arrest them and they go, they got a tip on them.

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 They go, "So why were you building this stuff, Lattie?"

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He goes, "Zombie Apocalypse or Nuclear War?"

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Kind of moans that on his breath, "Or Nuclear War."

250
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Because the zombie apocalypse one's more exciting, right?

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Like, "Nuclear War."

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And first off, this story takes place in 2018.

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I haven't heard someone be concerned about Nuclear War since 1988.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 When I was concerned about Nuclear War.

255
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Dude, who would we fight Nuclear War against?

256
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And there's, you might have a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan?

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Or Iran and Israel?

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Maybe?

259
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But anyways, this guy, "Zombie Apocalypse is at least a little trendy."

260
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Well, the problem is, was that that's not a legal defense in court.

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Your Honor, why do you have these weapons?

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Well, first off, so Scotland sucks.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Can I just say that?

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I know Stuart Meatballs from Scotland, so I apologize for saying that.

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But you need a license to have a BB gun in Scotland.

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 That is bizarre to me.

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And you go, "Well, Jason, you live in a country where people are able to carry 50 caliber rifles."

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And I say, "You're damn right I live in a country where people can carry around 50 caliber rifles."

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And it's an awesome country.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 But that's bizarre.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 They sell BB guns at the gas station probably about a mile from my house.

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I can go and buy a BB gun at the gas station.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And what's funny, which I thought was stupid because there's nothing stopping me from buying a BB gun

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 and then walking around the gas station and then coming back in and being like,

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "Give me all your money.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Because would you really know, would you take the chance that I have a BB gun?

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Why would you sell a weapon that looks like, they don't even have the orange tips.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 They don't even have the orange tips on these guns.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 They look like real guns.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And even if they have the orange tip, just take it off."

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That's what I used to do.

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I always thought, you know what I were done with?

283
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We're done with a zombie story.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He ended up getting four years in prison for all this stuff.

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 But anyways, I always thought, you know what would be a good idea if I was a criminal.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 "Is my high ship from side to side when I say that?"

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 You take real guns and then you paint them neon orange and neon green.

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So they kind of look like squirt guns.

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And then you kind of dress like in really cool 90s colors and have your hat backwards.

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Have your pants on backwards too, just complete the thing.

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Just wear all neon and people think you're some sort of like Halloween trendie.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Okay, to be fair, this would have worked better back in the 90s when squirt guns actually wore these colors.

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And they looked like, like Mac 10s, but neon orange.

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You could walk into a bank with a neon orange Uzi and people would, at first thing,

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 when you're committing a crime, it's all about the very first like 10/32nds.

296
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 That's where everything happens or doesn't happen.

297
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 So you want to have that.

298
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's just like, why am I giving you tips on how to be a criminal?

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And our next topic is going to be the story of the monster at Mount Hood.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 [Mont Hood growling]

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It's October 19th, 2019.

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 There's this forum called, I never heard of this before,

304
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 called NADP or the North American Dogman Project.

305
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And on this forum, there's a woman named Bee.

306
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 She's from New Zealand and she tells the story.

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Now she goes into this thing and she goes, I was a horse trainer.

308
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Generally, this is how people do these stories.

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 First off, they have to say, this is why you should believe me.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This is why I'm not crazy.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Now being a horse trainer doesn't automatically make you not crazy, but it does fit in.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 She's going, I was raised in the country.

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I was a horse trainer.

314
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I've been around big animals.

315
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I've been around the woods.

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I've been camping.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I'm not a city girl.

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So the fact that when I went to the Mount Hood, the very first time I had gone to the forest

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 in the United States, started having this experience.

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I'm not a city slicker.

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I know what to expect in the woods.

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 This was not something to expect in the woods.

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So grab your camping gear, guys.

324
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 We're going to join Bee and her husband as we travel to Hood River, Oregon.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Beautiful little town on the edge of darkness.

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Super spooky.

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 During the day, a bustling little metropolis, little asterisk.

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's actually a one street town, but at night, something dark.

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 There are certain roads I don't walk down during night.

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I won't walk down Wasco Street at night and there's another road.

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I don't know the name of it, but I walked down it at night.

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I've walked down into like four in the morning the other day and I said, I'm not doing this again.

333
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I'm not doing this again.

334
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I was going to Jiu Jitsu.

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I was like, no.

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 This town is weird.

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 This town and I'm one of the only few people who walk it, me and the homeless population.

338
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But every show, often I'll run into one of them, the glowing eyes in the darkness.

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Coming after me, day walker, job haver, home liver.

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Give me something.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I didn't have to like bring out my little, I have a blade that glows in the presence of a hobo.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Glows blue.

343
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Stay back.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 They go back into the dark.

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 That's not far from the truth.

346
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 But anyways, this road, there's some roads you walk down.

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 They were really, really scary.

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And then other roads I'll walk down two or three in the morning.

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 No problem at all.

350
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 But you turn a road and I was like, I'm not doing this again.

351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You just feel this presence on you.

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So when I found out this story took place in Mount Hood, one, I was really surprised because it's not far from me.

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And two, it kind of makes sense because this area is kind of spooky.

354
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Now they're out in the middle of the woods.

355
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So where I'm at, there's a lot of trees around and stuff like that.

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But as you go farther up, you get a lot of farmland and then you hit the forest.

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And B says they're in an area where they don't see another person.

358
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 They don't hear a car.

359
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 They just keep walking into the forest.

360
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 They're experienced campers, experienced hikers.

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Keep moving deeper into the woods and they find a little spot to stay.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 They're about six feet from a stream, beautiful little spot for a husband or wife.

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 They're sitting there and then all of a sudden her husband goes, don't look behind you.

364
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 B's just got to sit in there.

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Now when someone says that, of course, slowly turn your head.

366
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And when she turns around, she sees something tall and dark run through the tree line.

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Faster than she thinks that a human can run.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It rattles her.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Her husband doesn't really care about this whole thing.

370
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Her husband's just like, "Yeah, don't worry about it.

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Don't worry about the large shape that runs faster than a human.

372
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You'll be fine, honey."

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 He goes back to doing whatever he's doing.

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Now B's sitting there and she starts to get this feeling like she's being stalked.

375
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Her first time in the forests of America and she's feeling really uneasy and she's, honey, husband, whatever your name is.

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Will you find out what that giant lurching thing was in the woods?

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And the husband's like, "No, don't worry about it.

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It's probably not even though I told you don't turn around.

379
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Even though I initially saw something creepy behind you, I'm sure it's nothing."

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 She goes, "I can't relax here."

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 At this point it's still in the daytime.

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 She goes, "I can't relax here until I know what that was."

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 His response?

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 "Yell if you need me."

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Now what's interesting is we're going to follow this narrative and B is writing this story.

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And there's basically two things going on in this story.

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 One is the fact that she may or may not be stalked by a supernatural force.

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 The second one is her husband does not seem to care about her well-being at all.

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I don't know how her relationship is with this dude.

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 This was posted back on October 19th, 2019.

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I would be shocked if they're still married.

392
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I don't know how long they've been married.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I don't know how they met.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But throughout this story, he seems to care so little about this woman that it's comical.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 He sees a dark shadowy figure standing behind them.

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 She turns around. They both see it move faster than a human can move.

397
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 There's not something you want to be facing in the woods because your car is far away.

398
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And you have to move at human speeds to get there.

399
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 They both see that.

400
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 She gets startled. He seems to ignore it.

401
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 She is going to look for it.

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 He goes, "Yell if you need me."

403
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The yelling will be if she's attacked by the shadow demon.

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 So she will yell. It'll probably be too late because it runs faster than you.

405
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 She begins walking around.

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 She finds her first piece of evidence.

407
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 First pieces of evidence.

408
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 She finds a footprint the size of a dinner plate with claws.

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Dug into the soft organ soil.

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And then next to it, a big stinky pile of poop.

411
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Just sitting there on the ground.

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 She's like, "Hmmm evidence I see. Sticks her finger in it."

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 No, she doesn't do that.

414
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 She just looks at a pile of poop.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Now she does go on to explain that this isn't any ordinary pile of poop.

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 No, no, no. Don't think this is deer poop.

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 She says the poop was large.

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 She was a large pile of poop. She says it was more than a horse could poop.

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And it was just kind of like a weird shape.

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So I don't know if it looked like a perfect poop emoji.

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 She says it was a cube, a perfect cube.

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 It was an oddly large amount in an odd shape of poop laying in the forest.

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And a giant footprint the size of a dinner plate.

424
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 20 minutes later she comes back to the campsite and says,

425
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 "I didn't really find anything except for this giant thing of poop and a humongous footprint."

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Husband doesn't seem to care at all.

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Also the fact she was gone for 20 minutes didn't really care about that either.

428
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 That's a long time to be pursuing a supernatural creature without any communication with your husband.

429
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Now she tells her husband about the footprint and the poop and he's like,

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "Eh, maybe it's a bear."

431
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But there's bears in this area.

432
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But unless it was like a grizzly or kodiak passing through,

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 that seems like a pretty big footprint for a bear.

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 But again, both these guys are experienced hikers.

435
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 He's armed. He has a gun with him.

436
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 You go into the woods, you're going to run into mountain lions and bears and stuff like that.

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 That's not a reason for them immediately to pack up.

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So they're sitting at camp and they're drinking tea.

439
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And her back is to the forest again, which is stupid on her part.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And then, still day, a little bit later, drinking tea with her husband.

441
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And she starts to get intrusive thoughts.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Thoughts that aren't hers.

443
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Thoughts that aren't pleasant.

444
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 She sees in her mind herself running through the woods.

445
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Something stalking her.

446
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 She sees in her mind her body getting torn open.

447
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 She sees in her mind her death.

448
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And she hears a voice laughing in her head.

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 She can't get these thoughts out of her head.

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 They're overtaking her.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 She's trying to drink her tea. She's just trying to enjoy this sunny day.

452
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 She feels these thoughts in her head.

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Here's a quote from her post.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 "It got so bad I couldn't function normally and told my husband."

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Okay, that's the first part. Here's the second part.

456
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He laughed and said I was just a kiwi and didn't know American woods.

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Listen, man, if anyone's pro-USA, it's me, dude.

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 But I don't think I'm not like USA haunted woods.

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I'm pretty pro-USA, but if I'm with someone from out of the country and they're like,

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 all of a sudden having these visions of being brutally mauled, I'm not going to be like,

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 "Yeah, you're just from Argentina. Welcome to America, bro.

462
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's all good. These woods will do that to you as I'm envisioning myself like my skin getting flayed off."

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 This is what we do in America, dude.

464
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We always have intrusive thoughts in the woods.

465
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 What a jerk husband. She's sitting there and she goes, "I can't function normally."

466
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And he laughs at her. She's just a kiwi in the American woods.

467
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 We all have intrusive thoughts 24/7.

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 That's why America has such a big drug problem.

469
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Maybe we should stay out of the woods.

470
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Here's back to a quote.

471
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 "I said like hell, mate. Something is planning to kill me out there

472
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 and I can feel it watching me 24/7.

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I asked him, could a bear be emanating it?"

474
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I asked him, could a bear be emanating it?

475
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So this is, I kind of jumped the gun on this, but I think this is so funny.

476
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 It's interesting that this is on the North American Dogman Project

477
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 because that seems to be a super specific thing.

478
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 When I was reading this story, I didn't know where it was going.

479
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 I didn't even know what the acronym NADP meant.

480
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I just found this link on Reddit.

481
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It was talking about Woman Encounters Monster in Mount Hood.

482
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I click on it and I'm reading it. I'm thinking, "It's a big foot. Like what's going on?"

483
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And then I find out that this is a Wolfman project or sorry, Dogman project.

484
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 She keeps thinking it's an actual bear in the woods.

485
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Now at some point I think she figures out in real life after the event

486
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 that maybe it was a dogman and that's how she found this website.

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But I find it weird because even in this post on the Dogman Project

488
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 she keeps talking about it being a bear, which is fine.

489
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 That'd be the logical answer, right?

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 That there's something moving in the woods.

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Bears don't move faster than humans on two feet, but whatever.

492
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 She keeps thinking it's a bear, fine. But then we get to this sentence.

493
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I asked him, I refer to her husband,

494
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I asked him, "Could a bear be emanating its ideas to me?"

495
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So she's thinking, "Okay, maybe there's a bear in the woods

496
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 that's pooping and leaving giant footprints.

497
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Hey honey, do bears normally have the ability to

498
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 to psychically attack women in the woods?"

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Like why? That's a leap of logic.

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 That would...

501
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Anyway, so apparently she has no sense of biology

502
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 or just physics in general.

503
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Or really logic.

504
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 She goes, "I asked him, could a bear be emanating its ideas to me?"

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And he said, "That's not usual for animals to do.

506
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And maybe I'm just not used to the deep woods."

507
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 That's condescending.

508
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Your wife's nearly panicked and she's like,

509
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "Could it be possible that a bear is telepathically putting visions in my head

510
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and laughing in my head?"

511
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And he's like, "Animals don't normally do that.

512
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I think you're just having a hard time in the woods."

513
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But at this point he must be thinking this girl's really losing it.

514
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So how else would you answer that?

515
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Do bears normally put telepathic beams,

516
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 beam telepathic things into people's heads?

517
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I mean, no. Animals don't usually do that.

518
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Although he may believe that sometimes they do.

519
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 He though goes, "Don't worry dude, I have a gun.

520
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 If anything comes after us, I'll shoot it."

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And then that's when she hears a voice in her head.

522
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Right when he says that he has a gun.

523
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 "A gun won't stop me.

524
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Nothing can save you if I choose to get you."

525
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 She immediately tells her husband this.

526
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And he begins laughing out loud.

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I have no idea if these people are still together.

528
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But now it's night time. They go to sleep.

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Middle of the night she wakes up, lightly sleeping

530
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 because she's hearing these voices, she's having these visions.

531
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Her husband's a total dick.

532
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And she hears something outside the tent, breathing.

533
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I thought this was an interesting, it was quite specific

534
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 sound for breathing.

535
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 She said it sounded like, quote, "a big old buffalo breathing

536
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 as if it smoked for 30 years."

537
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Tent gets hit.

538
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Starts wrestling. The husband wakes up at this point.

539
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And he's looking at her and she's looking at him and it's pitch dark.

540
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And they both hear this breathing.

541
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And he tells her, "I'm gonna get my gun."

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Tent. Hit again.

543
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And he grabs the gun, he starts loading it.

544
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Now, he should have had it loaded much earlier when, you know,

545
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 the creature was running laps around the woods.

546
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 But he's now loading the gun safety, right?

547
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You don't really want to load it until you're ready to use it.

548
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He's loading the gun.

549
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He's not building the bullets. He's cocking it back.

550
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But while he's taking the moment to load the gun,

551
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 the noise stops. The breathing stops.

552
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The tent's assault stops. It's all gone like that.

553
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 They stay in the tent. They stay awake until morning.

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 When they come outside, they find outside the tent,

555
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 giant footprint,

556
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 giant pile of poop.

557
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Just like it was just sitting there,

558
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 just reading the newspaper, just letting it go.

559
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 This thing, whatever dimension he came from,

560
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 it must have had a Taco Bell because it was just like

561
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 all over the place.

562
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Now, she, again, so she goes through this whole experience

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and she ends the post with this question,

564
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 the most integral question of all,

565
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "Is this a monstrous bear

566
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and it can send feelings to me in my mind?"

567
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So she's still stuck on the bear.

568
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Now, she's posting this on the North American

569
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Dogman Project.

570
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And the people who respond to it are like,

571
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 "Hey, baby, can I call you?"

572
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Which I kind of expected.

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 So we have a couple of different things to look at here.

574
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 One, the story could be completely fake.

575
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It could be written by someone who

576
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 took a photo of a pretty girl and posted it on this

577
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 website to tell the story.

578
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Because I find it odd that someone who thought a bear

579
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 was telepathically talking to them would find

580
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 an incredibly obscure form called

581
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 the North American Dogman Project

582
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 and then post their photo to that.

583
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 But this is also like a very recent account.

584
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 She only had like nine posts,

585
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 very, very limited, and she was answering people,

586
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 she was answering questions in this thread.

587
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So if it was a con, what would be the end result of that?

588
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Two, she could be stuck in her mind that it's a bear,

589
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 but goes, "Well, it's not Bigfoot,

590
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I'm not gonna talk to those guys."

591
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 So she was probably googling monsters in the woods.

592
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And dogmen have apparently been sighted in Oregon.

593
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 There's been sightings of dogmen and stuff like that.

594
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 So it's possible she just stumbled across and a dogman

595
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 is at least something like she had found,

596
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 because they supposedly are photos of dogman footprints

597
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 and they are huge, look like giant dog footprints.

598
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 So what did she, oh, and I did some research.

599
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 A bunch of people have died on Mount Hood through climbing accidents.

600
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 There's been a few people who have died,

601
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 but have never been recovered,

602
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 but that obviously is most likely them falling down crevices and stuff like that.

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 This experience took more in the woods surrounding the mountain.

604
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So I'm not gonna say that, oh, it's going up in the mountain and eating people

605
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 and stuff like that, it's just people falling off cliffs.

606
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Into his mouth, "Argh!"

607
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 But no, so I mean, there have been people that have gone,

608
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 died and gone or missing and presumed dead up there,

609
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 but I'm not gonna try to connect the two.

610
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The question is, is there really a dogman monster walking around Mount Hood?

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Mount Hood is what, I bet, a mileage,

612
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 because I don't have a car, but maybe 20 miles away from where I'm at, 30?

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I think for season nine, or maybe season 10, it will depend.

614
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I think we might have to have an investigation up there.

615
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I think I might have to get some of my buddies and get a little portable recorder.

616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Maybe we'll have a camping expedition up there.

617
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 A couple episodes recorded in the middle of the woods while we're hunting the dogman.

618
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Maybe a live stream?

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Oh wait, probably won't get cell phone reception up there.

620
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 But I've always wanted to do like an on the field investigation.

621
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Now I'm not a really good hunter, so I'd have to hit up my buddy Carson,

622
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 because he's like an experienced outdoorsman.

623
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Hey Carson, he listens to show too.

624
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 He's an experienced outdoorsman hunter and stuff like that.

625
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I'd have to get him, see if he'd want to do it, but...

626
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Maybe we'll do an episode, maybe we will hunt the dogman.

627
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 We'll find out whether or not Bee was truly being stalked by something that was putting visions in her head.

628
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Will that happen in season nine? Who knows? I don't know.

629
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It might just be a pipe dream.

630
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So if sometime in the near future, you go to download Dead Rabbit Radio, there's no episode.

631
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And then another day, and then another day.

632
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And then you realize there are no episodes coming out.

633
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Start reading the Hood River news.

634
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 You may just see an article about a young handsome man,

635
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 famous podcaster, has gone missing in the woods,

636
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 along with a few of his friends.

637
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And you'll wonder, did they just fall off a cliff?

638
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 All four of them?

639
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 They get lost in a river?

640
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Or did they find what they were looking for?

641
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Did they find the Mount Hood Monster?

642
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
