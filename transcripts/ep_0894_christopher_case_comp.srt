1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 When the listener of the podcast sends me a joke, I should be laughing.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,600
 Instead, it makes me consider a horrifying detail I've never considered before.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:20,560
 And then we take a look at the mystery of Christopher Case, a young man who met an intoxicating

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,760
 woman on a business trip.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,020
 When he sat down to have drinks with his stranger, he had no idea he was sitting across the table.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,880
 I'm a vengeful witch, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,560
 [Music]

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
 whatever you're doing.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,560
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was a longtime supporter of the show,

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,240
 longtime Patreon supporter, longtime listener, sent us a ton of stories over the years.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,720
 Everyone give it up for Ampus Allen.

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 Woohoo!

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,760
 Yeah, come on in buddy, come on in.

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,720
 He's been here a lot recently, sent the story about, do aliens visit Earth because we're

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,000
 one of the few places in the galaxy that has snow.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,080
 Lot of interesting stuff over the years, Ampus Allen, very, very thankful to have you in Dead

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,200
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand guys, just help spread the word

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,440
 about the show, that really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,320
 It helps out so much when you get the word out about Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,360
 Ampus Allen, let's go ahead and hand you the launch codes for the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,200
 We got to leave Earth behind that beautiful blue globe floating in the Milky Way.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,160
 We got to say goodbye to Earth because we're headed all the way out to deep space.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,720
 It's a nice leisurely journey through the vastness of space.

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,120
 We got all the tame you could ask for and unlimited astronaut ice cream.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
 That's all I packed.

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,320
 I hope you guys have your own multivitamins with you.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,840
 Because this is going to be a long journey or a short one.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,760
 I don't know.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,040
 I honestly don't know how long this segment's going to go.

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,440
 Because this, let's get into it, let's get into it, hopefully short.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
 Hopefully it doesn't take the whole 30 minutes.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,640
 I can't imagine it would do that.

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,120
 But I find this idea so troubling that I don't...

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,080
 Okay so let's get into this.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
 The other day I did an episode called Intergalactic Cookout.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 It was a fun one.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,640
 But if you didn't listen to that episode, basically, it's so bizarre.

44
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,840
 Four people were out in the Arizona desert looking for some turquoise.

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 They were like stone collectors or they sold it.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,440
 And they saw a UFO disguised as dirt.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,960
 You really should listen to the episode.

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
 It's so crazy.

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,400
 But they see a UFO disguised as dirt land.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
 Maybe a couple of football fields away from them.

51
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,360
 And then the dirt opened up and out walked humans.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,400
 Or aliens disguised as humans.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
 Who knows?

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
 And they weren't just...

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,280
 They weren't just wearing human skin.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,400
 They were wearing human clothes.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,160
 They were wearing like khaki pants and t-shirts.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,760
 And they brought out a barbecue.

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,880
 There was like two dudes, two women and a couple kids.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,360
 And they brought out a barbecue pit.

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 A cooler.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
 You guys are like chasing your toe.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
 You're making this up.

64
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 You're just trying to trick us.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 Those are the little devils.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
 No, this was...

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
 It's so weird.

68
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,360
 And they had a barbecue in the Arizona desert.

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
 And the kids were playing with toys.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
 And the men are grilling the meat.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
 And the girls are serving the drinks.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,840
 And then one of the dudes, one of these guys who walked out of this dirt UFO walked up

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,880
 to the four no one humans.

74
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
 We know these people are humans.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,640
 Walked up to the four turquoise hunters.

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
 And the alien guy goes, "What are you guys doing here?"

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,120
 And they said, "Uh, we're hunting for turquoise.

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
 What are you guys doing here?

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
 How are you flying around dirt?"

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,000
 And the alien said, "I'll never understand humans and their fascination with rocks."

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,840
 Then he turned and he went back to the barbecue.

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,900
 And then after a while they packed all the stuff up and got back on the dirt UFO and

83
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,900
 Fluway.

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,560
 Super bizarre story, right?

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
 Very, very interesting.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,520
 Especially even in UFO lore, that's bizarre.

87
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,320
 Even when you look at cattle mutilations and alien abductions and human hybrid programs

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,400
 and all that stuff.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,440
 This is a story that totally sticks out in a world of the weird.

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,040
 It's the weirdest.

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,280
 I love that story.

92
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 I'm glad I could share it with you guys.

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 And then we have a listener.

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,920
 Jason actually mispronounces his name.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 If you guys can believe that, Jason, you never mispronounced that.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
 Paul Yeana.

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,680
 Paul is his first name.

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,440
 Paul Yeana, he actually sent me that book of vampires and vampirism.

99
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,360
 It was written like 20 years after Dracula came out.

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,200
 It's one of the first surveys of vampire myths.

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,560
 He sent me that book from my Amazon wish list.

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,480
 Really, really thank you for that.

103
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,440
 And Paul Yeana, we were talking via Instagram or Facebook, one of the two.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,480
 And he sent me this little message after that episode.

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,240
 And let me just read it to you here.

106
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,880
 It's a quote.

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
 He's talking about that intergalactic cookout episode.

108
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
 He goes, quote, "It's like the intergalactic equivalent of two families climbing into

109
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,560
 a broken station wagon, going to a national park for a barbecue, seeing a bear, and instead

110
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,240
 of keeping their distance, they decide to feed it and try to take selfies with it."

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,560
 Unquote.

112
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,240
 I read that comment and I thought, I think I sent back kind of a jokey response to him,

113
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,520
 but like, well, yeah, I guess you're right.

114
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,120
 But I have been thinking about his comment a lot.

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
 And it's super troubling.

116
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,760
 I never considered this before.

117
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,880
 This is super disturbing to me.

118
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,000
 In UFO lore, we know aliens come down, they interact with humans.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,560
 They will sometimes abduct them, put an implant, run psychological tests on them.

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,960
 And sometimes in the most horrific alien abduction stories, the aliens will rape humans.

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,200
 Men and women will be raped by aliens.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:30,360
 And whether it's for the Alien Hybrid program, or just for sheer evil, there's a ton of

123
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,400
 accounts of aliens raping humans.

124
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,440
 There's not a ton of accounts of aliens killing humans, but that would make sense because

125
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,760
 they're dead and they can't tell us the story.

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,840
 But we've covered all sorts of stories on this show from alien sexual assault to people

127
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,040
 being trapped by aliens and seeing catatonic humans trapped in cages, all sorts of creepy

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
 stuff.

129
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:03,720
 And never once did I consider the thought that aliens could be taking pictures.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,240
 I never once thought of an alien taking a photograph of a human.

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
 And this is why that is, this is so, this is so disturbing to me.

132
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,040
 I almost feel like I have an uncanny valley effect to it.

133
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,760
 This physically makes me ill to think about this subject.

134
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
 Now I don't want to take up too much time talking about this.

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,480
 I have a bad feeling that I might, so I'm going to try to be succinct.

136
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,000
 And this makes sense if you think about it.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 This really makes sense because we do it.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,120
 We catalog life on Earth.

139
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,040
 Even before the invention of the camera, we have drawings of animals.

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,400
 People would see a salamander and they would sketch the salamander and then that drawing

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,640
 would go into an encyclopedia.

142
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,560
 You would have a human and they're doing an autopsy and you'd have people sketch the

143
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,800
 organs and that would go into a medical journal.

144
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
 Before the invention of the photograph, we highly detailed.

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
 We had illustrations for everything.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,680
 Especially things that you knew the reader wouldn't have access to.

147
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,800
 If it's a nature guide and you know they're never going to be able to go to Guam, you'll

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
 have sketches of all the flowers and all of the wildlife.

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,320
 But once the camera was invented and it became portable and affordable, you begin taking photographs

150
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 of everything.

151
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,800
 Here's a picture of this, here's a picture of that, here's a picture of this flower,

152
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,080
 here's a picture of this animal.

153
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,240
 So it would make sense that aliens traveling across the galaxy, I never considered this

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,360
 before, would highly document their journeys.

155
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:47,800
 Here would have to be massive archives of video and photographic proof of their experiments.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,880
 So what did that mean?

157
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
 This is why this disturbs me so much.

158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,720
 Is that what that means is somewhere out there in the galactic archives of these great alien

159
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,360
 empires like the reptilians or the greys or any of the other ones, there are photographs

160
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,560
 of humans suffering.

161
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:18,080
 There are still images of a woman in terror as she realizes she has been abducted and

162
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:28,820
 she's looking at her son being dragged off by inhuman creatures.

163
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,720
 There are photographs of children crying out for their mother as they are being strapped

164
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 down to a cold metal table.

165
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,440
 There's video footage of people pleading to be released pleading for any mercy at all

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,360
 as alien tools are drilling into their skull.

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,180
 And there is video footage and still images and audio recordings of human men and women

168
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:13,020
 being raped by alien life forms.

169
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,540
 I never ever considered that fact.

170
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,580
 You could go, well Jason maybe it's not video footage, maybe it's a hologram.

171
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,060
 I'm not quibbling with the technology that's used to capture the torment.

172
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,760
 I never even considered this.

173
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,200
 And in the lore, in the UFO stories, I don't think we've come across something like this.

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 I could be wrong.

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,320
 I can't remember a time where someone is being experimented on by aliens and they see themselves

176
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,880
 being recorded.

177
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,760
 I can't recall that.

178
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,720
 But it has to be happening because we do it and the one thing we know about the alien

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,160
 phenomenon is they have a lot of the same traits as humans and a trait that I think

180
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,860
 every space faring civilization has to have, they're curious.

181
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,780
 To soar through deep space looking for something, you would have to be curious to do that.

182
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:09,660
 You'd have to have a curious species to wonder what's out there.

183
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,700
 And they would highly document their endeavors.

184
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,460
 So I know Paul was kind of making a joke, but that's really troubling to me.

185
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,100
 That's horrific, honestly.

186
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,760
 I find that so deeply disturbing that, like I say, it kind of makes me sick to my stomach.

187
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,700
 Because we read these stories and it's one thing to have this person fall prey to this

188
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,080
 alien invader and then they get free and you go, "Wow, that was an insane story."

189
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,920
 But you know, it was horrible thing that happened to you, but you're back here.

190
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,240
 Versus their entire experience, all of the fear they felt, all of the physical pain and

191
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,980
 mental torture they went through is also cataloged down to the second.

192
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:06,540
 Videotaped, photographed, recorded for posterity on an alien world.

193
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,620
 People undergo horrific crimes that they do get videotaped and they're shared online

194
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,780
 and people laugh and they gain enjoyment from watching these things.

195
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,580
 And imagine if you went through a horrible crime, that's bad enough, but now you know

196
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,040
 there's video footage of it out there and people are still watching it.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
 So yeah, terrifying.

198
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,960
 Thanks, thanks Paul for opening my eyes to this.

199
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,920
 I mean, I don't think that was your intent.

200
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,360
 Your intent wasn't to make me sick to my stomach.

201
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,040
 So all the UFO alien stories we cover, from the funny ones to the deeply disturbing ones,

202
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 they are most likely recorded for posterity and stored away somewhere.

203
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,660
 That fear, that torment, that anguish, preserved for eternity.

204
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,660
 It was just a moment in time, something that the human may have forgotten about.

205
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,340
 They could have been hypnotized by the aliens, they could have had their mind wiped.

206
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,300
 The human may not even know that it ever happened, but somewhere out there, there's a video

207
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,180
 of them being strapped down to a table and having horrendous medical experience.

208
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,680
 If you're lucky, medical experiments run on you.

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,040
 If you're lucky, it could be one of these other horrible things that aliens have been

210
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,400
 known to do to humans.

211
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,760
 Terrifying, terrifying story to get involved in and intend that, he was just making a goofy

212
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
 joke.

213
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,000
 But thank you for that horrible image nonetheless.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,320
 Ampersalyn, let's go ahead and, Ampersalyn is hiding under the carpet, he's like "Bro,

215
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,240
 I don't want to go anywhere else."

216
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,260
 The story was spooky, come here Ampers.

217
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,860
 Ampers, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbindercopter, we're just

218
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,740
 going to leave the rocket ship here floating in deep space.

219
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,020
 We're headed back to Earth, the only place that's worth hanging out in the universe.

220
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:07,180
 We're going all the way back to Earth, specifically we're headed out to San Francisco.

221
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,900
 First off, I want to start this segment off by giving a shout out to the website where

222
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,100
 I found the story at.

223
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,240
 I was not familiar with the story, I found this on a website known as the Morbid Library

224
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,280
 and I got a lot of information from a really well written article written by Casper McFadden.

225
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,440
 So shout out to you guys, I've been perusing the website a little bit more, it looks like

226
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,600
 you guys have some really cool, really creepy true crime stuff.

227
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,560
 So if you're into that, that will be in the show notes.

228
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,360
 It's April 11th, 1991 and we're in the city of San Francisco and we're here to meet a

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
 young man.

230
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,260
 His name is Christopher Case.

231
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:51,140
 He's 35 years old, he used to live in North Carolina, Raleigh, Raleigh, one of the two,

232
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
 North Carolina.

233
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,380
 He leaves there, he moves to Seattle, Washington and while he's in Seattle he has a business

234
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,220
 trip to San Francisco.

235
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,820
 So that's why we're in San Francisco right now and we don't have a ton of information

236
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,380
 to go off of in the beginning of the story.

237
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,520
 As the story progresses, you'll go, "Jay, so this is obviously creepy pasta, this doesn't

238
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,800
 sound right."

239
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,240
 This story was reported in several mainstream newspapers over the course of a few months,

240
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,860
 newspapers in North Carolina and newspapers in Seattle, Washington because it became

241
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,320
 such a bizarre case.

242
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,720
 So even though we don't have a lot of the initial details, as the story goes on the

243
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,920
 details become a little more concrete.

244
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,120
 What we know is that on April 11th he was in San Francisco on a business trip and at

245
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:45,420
 some point during this day he meets a woman and they hit it off right away.

246
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,740
 It's one of those moments where you bump into someone you barely know and you just start

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,300
 talking to them and you guys have everything in common.

248
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:01,020
 It seems like the conversation flows in such a way and by the end there's such a bond between

249
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,420
 you and this other person you're almost thinking, "Do I know you from a past life?

250
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,400
 Do you feel so comfortable?

251
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,280
 You feel like such a good friend and I just met you."

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,520
 They talked for hours on this initial meeting.

253
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,000
 Everything just clicked.

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,080
 Everything perfectly fell into place between Christopher Case and this woman.

255
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,000
 But as the night was winding down, she made a move on him.

256
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,220
 She wanted it to be more than this deep spiritual connection.

257
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,340
 It feels like we've known each other for years and we've only talked for a few hours.

258
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
 She wanted more than that.

259
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,820
 She wanted it to get a little frisky.

260
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
 And he declines.

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
 No, not interested.

262
00:16:52,820 --> 00:17:00,460
 I don't know if he put it that bluntly, but he does decline.

263
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,700
 She becomes very upset by this.

264
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,960
 She really pisses her off.

265
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,760
 And at this point she tells him, "I'm a witch.

266
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,200
 I'm actually a witch."

267
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,240
 You should have known that from the pointy hat and the fact that we are at Witch's Brew

268
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,280
 restaurant, but I'm a witch.

269
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,880
 And I don't like the fact that she turned me down.

270
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 So I'm going to curse you.

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
 I'm going to cast the curse.

272
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,660
 You will be dead within a week because you would not have sex with me.

273
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:42,860
 The reason why we know about that incident is because he immediately got really concerned

274
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,580
 by this.

275
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
 He was not a big believer in the occult.

276
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,900
 He wasn't a big believer in witchcraft or anything like that.

277
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,180
 But when anyone threatens your life, whether it be magical or otherwise, a lot of people

278
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
 are going to get concerned.

279
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,720
 Most people will be concerned about that.

280
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,840
 Because you don't know if she's like, "My witchcraft will get you away from me."

281
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,580
 That's the name of her street gang.

282
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,360
 But then also you have to think, "Maybe she is a witch.

283
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,920
 Maybe she actually does have these powers."

284
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,800
 He begins calling his friends up.

285
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,440
 He has a lot of friends still in North Carolina.

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,120
 And they can tell he's really upset by this.

287
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,240
 And this is where we get most of the story is from his friends who were interviewed by

288
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,420
 the police and by newspapers after this event happened.

289
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,700
 He was calling his friends up and he goes, "Hey guys, I met this girl in San Francisco

290
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,020
 and everything was going great until she threatened to kill me using black magic."

291
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,460
 And they could tell, his friends could tell that he was very, very worried that she was

292
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
 the real deal.

293
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,860
 Even though he didn't believe in this stuff.

294
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,500
 He actually, it wasn't that he just didn't believe in it.

295
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,020
 He didn't have any interest in it.

296
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,740
 He didn't care about it.

297
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
 He didn't look into it.

298
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
 He wasn't even openly skeptical.

299
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,840
 It just wasn't anything interesting to him until a witch cursed him.

300
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,080
 And one of the friends, one of his old friends was a woman named Sammy Soder.

301
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,000
 And Sammy, she claims to be a psychic.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,920
 She goes, "We got a lot of information about this story from her."

303
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,920
 She goes, "I've known Christopher for 10 years, never expressed any interest in the

304
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,040
 paranormal or the occult at all.

305
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 He calls me up.

306
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,520
 He's freaking out.

307
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,040
 Is this stuff real?

308
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,600
 Can it actually affect me?"

309
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,180
 "Am I cursed to die in seven days?"

310
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,460
 Christopher ends up traveling back to Seattle.

311
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,660
 He was in San Francisco for just a brief trip, brief business trip.

312
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,980
 On April 18th, 1991, one of his friends from North Carolina can't get ahold of Christopher.

313
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,260
 And she becomes very concerned for his welfare.

314
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,340
 They know the mental state that he's been in.

315
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,080
 He's been calling the friends very, very concerned about this witch encounter.

316
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,840
 The friend ends up calling the police in Seattle asking for a welfare check.

317
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
 Can he swing by?

318
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
 Check on my friend, Christopher Case.

319
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
 Here's his address.

320
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 Sir?

321
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,000
 Sir, Seattle Police.

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,080
 Are you okay in there?

323
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
 No answer.

324
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
 They don't hear anyone walk into the door.

325
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,340
 Ah, I guess he's okay.

326
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,840
 The police leave.

327
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:24,060
 A short time later, Seattle Police, we probably should have checked on you.

328
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,660
 That's what we're here for, welfare check.

329
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,740
 Can you open up the door, sir?

330
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,860
 We want to see if you're okay.

331
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,220
 Your friends are worried about you.

332
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 No answer.

333
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,620
 The police look at each other and go, "Uh-huh.

334
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
 We'll come back later.

335
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,620
 We'll come back later."

336
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,240
 Again, it's welfare check.

337
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,560
 People are concerned because he's not talking to anyone.

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
 He's not picking up the phone.

339
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
 They knock on the door.

340
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
 He's not coming to the door.

341
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,280
 The police are like, "Yeah, yeah.

342
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
 Maybe he's just taking one of those naps where you hear no noise and it lasts forever."

343
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,520
 So they leave.

344
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,560
 They come back a third time.

345
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,000
 In the police handbook, it does say third time's a charm.

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Whenever you're trying to handcuff someone, you're going to mess up the first two times.

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,440
 But on the third time, you'll have him in cuffs.

348
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
 Seattle Police, sir.

349
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
 Open up.

350
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
 We're going to come in.

351
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,260
 Welfare check.

352
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,500
 Okay, let's go in.

353
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,660
 I don't think they kicked down the door.

354
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,060
 I don't think they busted down the door.

355
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,060
 They didn't seem to urge it to go in the first two times.

356
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,660
 Probably got keys from the landlord.

357
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,860
 They end up entering the apartment.

358
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,700
 When they walk into the apartment, they realize immediately that something very odd is going

359
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,020
 on here.

360
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:39,000
 Every single wall in the apartment has salt poured along the edge.

361
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,680
 Very, very old school way to keep out spirits and ghosts.

362
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,840
 You salt your house.

363
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,920
 Now generally, you salt your entrances.

364
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,600
 You salt your doorways and your windows.

365
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
 The fact that he salted the entire apartment, that's generally not necessary.

366
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
 You don't have to do that.

367
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,400
 You just have to take it from a guy.

368
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,560
 I salted a witch myself over that I was sitting in the show.

369
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,100
 You just salt the entrances.

370
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,020
 But salt everywhere.

371
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,700
 That's a sign of someone who doesn't really know what they're doing.

372
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,060
 It's just a waste of salt at a certain point.

373
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,340
 But anyways, they find all this salt.

374
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,660
 They do find crucifixes.

375
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,540
 Several crucifixes spread throughout the apartment hanging on the wall.

376
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,980
 And they find around 10 candles burned completely down.

377
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,740
 Out on the porch of the apartment, there is more salt.

378
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:35,800
 This time the salt is poured in geometric designs on the porch.

379
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,280
 And they do locate Christopher Case.

380
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
 He's laying in his empty bathtub.

381
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 He's dead.

382
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,160
 Now this actually popped up in the news.

383
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,480
 Like I said, in the Seattle newspapers and in newspapers in Raleigh, North Carolina.

384
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,920
 Because it was such a bizarre mystery.

385
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,880
 How did this young man die?

386
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,980
 At first they had no idea what it was.

387
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
 Was it a witch?

388
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,300
 Did a witch kill this man?

389
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,460
 But that was included in the articles.

390
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,820
 They would say stuff like, here's the story leading up to this man.

391
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,660
 He thought he was cursed by a witch.

392
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,980
 The police come in and it was apartment.

393
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
 They find the salt and he's dead.

394
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,420
 And we don't know why.

395
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,380
 And then we have the benefit of time.

396
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,100
 We can look at articles that have been published years ago.

397
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
 This happened back in the 90s.

398
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,020
 But at the time they're like, we don't know why this guy died.

399
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
 We have theories.

400
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,560
 We're putting out theories.

401
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,600
 One of them was carbon monoxide poisoning.

402
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,840
 Because he was burning candles.

403
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,800
 They found that 10 candles isn't enough to do carbon monoxide poisoning.

404
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,560
 Don't quote me on that if you're like, oh I only had 9 going.

405
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
 I'll do 10.

406
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
 Jason said it's okay.

407
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,720
 But if he was burning multiple candles, maybe they only found that 10 burned out.

408
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,840
 He could have been burning more over the previous nights and created carbon monoxide poisoning.

409
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,360
 But then when they did the autopsy, that turned out to be true.

410
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
 And they did the autopsy.

411
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,580
 He had died of a heart attack.

412
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,340
 This young man 35 years old had died of a heart attack.

413
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,740
 Which is very rare, but not unheard of.

414
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,420
 But even when the articles did report how he died with a heart attack, the articles were

415
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,540
 still basically saying, did he scare himself to death?

416
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,940
 Did he work himself up so much about this witch's curse that he had a heart attack?

417
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,800
 He was so terrified he had a heart attack.

418
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,920
 Or was the witch's curse true?

419
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,120
 Now none of the mainstream articles actually said that.

420
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,800
 But once the mainstream articles were published, we're looking at other people writing articles

421
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,680
 like the Morbid Library and podcasts like this that would say, was the witch's curse

422
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
 true?

423
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,840
 Is that what happened?

424
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:52,200
 What's interesting is the story I just read you is almost detailed by detail to the Morbid

425
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,900
 Library's story.

426
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,700
 But there are a couple details that aren't correct.

427
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,460
 And this tends to what happen in these stories.

428
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,300
 They kind of start to get exaggerated.

429
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,820
 And Morbid Library, you guys did a great job.

430
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,900
 I'm not criticizing that.

431
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,220
 I think eventually the information kind of gets changes a bit and stuff like that.

432
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,220
 The key details are correct.

433
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,060
 Christopher Case died of a heart attack in his bathtub.

434
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,660
 He claimed to have met a witch in San Francisco and was complaining to his friends about

435
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
 this.

436
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,240
 He was very, very terrified.

437
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
 That's all true.

438
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,040
 The seven days thing is not true.

439
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,240
 You'll find the curse was going to take place in seven days.

440
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,440
 It was April 11th when he met her and it was April 18th when he died.

441
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,720
 Sammy, Sammy Soder, the psychic said he was calling me for the past few weeks about this.

442
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,520
 So it was not a seven day time period.

443
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,960
 I think that was something that was added in after the fact.

444
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
 I don't know why.

445
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,740
 I don't know if someone got sloppy on their notes and then that version of the story started

446
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
 getting passed in.

447
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,740
 But that's not true.

448
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,900
 Sammy in the articles, you can look through the articles, she says he called me for the

449
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,140
 past few weeks and said that he was nervous about this.

450
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,780
 So definitely this story did not take place within seven days.

451
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,180
 It's also interesting, I found this detail going through different articles about it,

452
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,700
 that he was complaining not just that there was a witch's curse on him.

453
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,500
 He was definitely doing that.

454
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:23,000
 And towards the end of this few week time period where he was freaking out to his friends

455
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,200
 about this, he left a message on one of his friends answering machine and he left this

456
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:36,240
 message on Sammy's answering machine that he felt that "people are trying to do things

457
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
 to me."

458
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
 Were they physical people he was complaining about?

459
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,800
 Did she have a gang called the witchcraft crew?

460
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,080
 They were coming around with their broomsticks banging on his door.

461
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,220
 Was he actually worried about real people doing real bodily harm to him?

462
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,460
 Was he so wrapped up in this magic, this curse idea that he began to hallucinate things?

463
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,380
 He began to become truly paranoid.

464
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,980
 Or is it possible that, you know, I've kind of been glossing over this whole thing in this

465
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,820
 paranormal podcast, she may have been a real witch.

466
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,020
 Now this is high level witchcraft.

467
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,080
 The average witch you meet on the street or the average witch you see on TikTok couldn't

468
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,160
 do this in a million years.

469
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,660
 Stuff like this is very very rare in the witchcraft community.

470
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,260
 High magic, you could pull stuff off like this.

471
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,420
 You still have to be a pretty good practitioner.

472
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,440
 But witchcraft is considered low magic.

473
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,920
 It's all very, it's basically law of attraction with rhymes.

474
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,700
 There's not much to witchcraft.

475
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,960
 It's very very low skill level.

476
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,920
 And because it's low skill level, it's low result level or you really don't get any

477
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,540
 huge things.

478
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,980
 Witchcraft has a cultural cache because of the entertainment industry.

479
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,300
 First off, yeah, it could have been true.

480
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,380
 She could have been rejected by this guy and then she killed him using magic.

481
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,660
 That's definitely possible in the world of the paranormal.

482
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,380
 Then you have the thing that she may not have been that powerful of a witch, which I honestly

483
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,820
 think is true even though that power level is possible.

484
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,560
 If she's using that level of power every time someone rejects her, that's really really

485
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,520
 using a bazooka to take out a fly.

486
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,200
 The amount of magic you would have to call on to curse someone, to kill them just because

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,320
 you got rejected.

488
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,600
 It just seems that to me is the more ludicrous part of the story.

489
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,680
 That someone who has this level of power is just going to kill some random person because

490
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,600
 they don't want to have sex with them.

491
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 Find that odd.

492
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,180
 Because if you have this level of power, you can just make him have sex with you.

493
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,260
 There's always a huge debate in the witchcraft community, or the magic community in general,

494
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,100
 about love spells and is that considered date rape?

495
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,340
 Because that technology, I shouldn't say that technology, those techniques are there in

496
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,260
 that community.

497
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,940
 You have the idea, and this is the most popular one, even in the news articles where they

498
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,700
 are mentioning witchcraft and things like that, is that she said she was a witch and

499
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:09,680
 she did threaten that he would die and that scared him so bad he scared himself to death.

500
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,760
 That's what you'll see in a lot of these articles, he scared himself to death.

501
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,040
 He had a heart attack because he was so scared and died.

502
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,560
 A fascinating story and it's a terrifying one as well because basically what it's about

503
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,920
 is a man being hunted and he has no safe haven.

504
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,880
 He's not in the city he grew up in.

505
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,180
 He's in a brand new big town trying to make a new life for himself when he stumbled across

506
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
 the witch.

507
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,900
 Of all things, a witch.

508
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,340
 And of course he knows no one's gonna believe him.

509
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,420
 He talks to his old friends and I'm sure some of them were saying like I'm saying, "Ah,

510
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,180
 just forget about it, it's nothing."

511
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,540
 If she was a wizard now you should be worried.

512
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,220
 If it was high magic I'd be concerned.

513
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,620
 But I'm sure a lot of his friends were trying to console him and even Sammy.

514
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,800
 She might have been giving him advice on how to fight back against the witch.

515
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,880
 But just because you're psychic doesn't mean you're a believer in magic.

516
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,640
 They're honestly two different things.

517
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,240
 Psychic is more in the world of science.

518
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,280
 Magic is in the world of fantasy.

519
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,720
 So you're in a new city, you can call your friends, but what can they do?

520
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,560
 Even if they lived near you, what are you gonna do?

521
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,440
 And you can't call the cops.

522
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,060
 What can they do?

523
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,020
 So you just sit and try to ignore it.

524
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,740
 But every little thing that goes wrong in your life over those next few weeks you think

525
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,420
 it's the curse coming true.

526
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,100
 And for all you know it is.

527
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,540
 For all we know it was.

528
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,820
 We don't know what killed Christopher Case.

529
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,260
 Could have been a heart defect.

530
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,940
 He could have been scared to death.

531
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,900
 Or he could have been killed by a witch's curse.

532
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:07,800
 Again, a witch who would have to be extremely powerful and extremely petty to kill a man

533
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,620
 for turning her down.

534
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,120
 And while the mystery of the death of Christopher Case may never be solved, it's very likely

535
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,740
 that that woman, that witch, is still out there.

536
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,740
 A person so powerful she can kill you.

537
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,460
 She can kill you without laying a finger on you.

538
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,540
 She can kill you by using fear.

539
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,820
 She's still out there.

540
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,160
 I doubt this is the first time she's done it too.

541
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,660
 Or the last.

542
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,920
 So at a certain point you have to ask yourself, is she a witch?

543
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,520
 Or just the serial killer?

544
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:07,320
 Whose preferred mode of murder is fear itself.

545
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,880
