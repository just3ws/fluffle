1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
 A hole in a desert in the middle of Yemen may lead a clue towards a deeper conspiracy.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,600
 A couple of boys are walking around their neighborhood looking for a goonie-esque adventure.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,680
 Instead they stumble across some old Halloween decorations.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,240
 And then we meet ourselves as we come face to face with the doppelganger today on Dead

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,240
 Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,440
 Two eleven episodes left until the end of season fourteen.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,400
 That's another way to say that is I have eleven more episodes left to record before I can

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,520
 go on vacation.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
 I am trying to pack them in.

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
 But I have to do as many as I can while the weather is good because this weekend is going

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,120
 to be a scorcher.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,960
 Speaking of scorching, I don't really know if this is a segway.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,720
 I don't know if he enjoys fire.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,200
 But coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our one of our legacy Patreon supporters,

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
 Dennis Currycob.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
 Everyone give a round of applause to Dennis.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
 Everyone do this.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,480
 I'm doing make this sound of your two hands hitting each other.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,040
 Dennis, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,560
 Just help spread the word about the show.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
 Really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,320
 Also drink plenty of fluids.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,280
 I'm giving you that advice now as well.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,200
 And also let's take a look at our Van Art Friday for today.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
 This is actually another piece of art we used to use a lot in rotation from Smashers 25.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,960
 It's a really cool take on the Dead Rabbit Local.

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,600
 Thank you so much Smashers 25.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,960
 I really appreciate it.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,240
 Dennis, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,840
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,160
 We are going to find a freeway somewhere that drives us all the way from Dead Rabbit Command

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,880
 to the country of Yemen.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,840
 I don't know why I'm doing a story that takes place in a desert.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,800
 I don't know what I'm thinking.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 Everyone picture.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,360
 Picture you're here right now.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,360
 The scorching sand underneath your feet.

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 The blistering wind brushing against your cheek.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
 I'm fully in an air conditioned bubble but you guys are walking through sands getting

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,760
 in your eyes and like me and Dennis are totally encapsulated in this air conditioned bubble.

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,480
 We're in the Al Mahara Desert in Yemen.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,160
 There's this hole in the desert.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,520
 It's about 98 feet across.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,120
 Estimated to be between 300 to 800 feet deep but they don't know for sure.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
 There's the hole in the middle of the desert.

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,440
 Salu Babhair, he's the director general of the Mahara Geological Survey and Mineral Resources

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,840
 Authority.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
 He said that this hole is quite odd.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
 Here's a quote from him.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,240
 We notice strange things inside.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,320
 We also smelled something strange.

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,120
 It's a mysterious situation.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
 Unquote.

59
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,640
 This is all the hallmarks of stuff we cover on this show all the time so why aren't I

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
 more excited?

61
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,520
 Why am I spending more time laughing at the fact you have sand in your eyes?

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
 Super hot sand.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
 Now I'll hop in the bubble.

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,240
 You can get a little air conditioned too.

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,920
 But how come I'm having more intro?

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,520
 How come I'm doing more of an intro than I've seemed very lackluster with this story?

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,880
 I think you guys picked up on the tone.

68
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,800
 This hole's been here for millions and millions of years.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
 It's not new.

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,040
 So I mean sure it's a smelly deep hole but it's been smelly and deep for millions of

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 years.

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
 Mysterious, right?

73
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,520
 There are a lot of legends of it.

74
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,840
 Locals don't go near the hole.

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,800
 They actually consider it cursed.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,280
 They think if you go too close to the hole it'll pull you in.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,800
 Photographers apparently have tried taking pictures near the hole but the article says

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,960
 this is from the Associated Foreign Press by the way.

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,720
 This isn't from some wackadoodle news site.

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
 This Associated Foreign Press is written in this story.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,760
 And we're building to something if you're thinking Jason, normally you're jiving on

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,240
 this stuff a little bit more.

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,640
 You're not rushing these episodes are you?

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 No.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,320
 This story is infinitely more fascinating than a hole in a ground.

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 Stick with me.

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,960
 I think I've earned your guys trust over 701 episodes.

88
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
 So stick with me.

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,840
 It's been there for millions of years.

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
 The locals refuse to go near it.

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,000
 The locals actually refuse to even talk about it.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,640
 They're scared of this big black hole in the middle of the ground.

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,160
 They actually think it's the home to Jinn.

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,120
 The home to these evil spirits.

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,560
 And that's what's causing the odors to come out of the hole.

96
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,080
 Oddly enough this should be kind of a nice thing.

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
 I mean it is in the middle of the desert.

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,060
 It's not like a city right next to it but birds live in the hole.

99
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,280
 So that means that the gas whatever it is is not noxious.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,520
 They can see birds kind of fly in and out of the hole.

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,600
 So there must be some sort of nest around there.

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,040
 I don't think they're like pretty blue jades.

103
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,160
 I don't think they're stuff from a Cinderella cartoon.

104
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,760
 They're probably like hideous vultures waiting to eat you.

105
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 But birds nonetheless.

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,200
 Now I saw that article.

107
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,600
 I saw that article originally pop up on Coast to Coast AM's website which I visit every

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 single day.

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
 And I thought that's really interesting but you know I don't usually just take one source.

110
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
 I kind of poke around.

111
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,600
 And so I started looking at this and I found three other articles all published within 24

112
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
 hours of each other.

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 All word for word exactly the same associated foreign press.

114
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,520
 I saw one on Fizz.org.

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 That's not a Soto website.

116
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,040
 Fizz.org it's a mainstream science site.

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,960
 Fizz as in physics.

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,200
 France24.com it's a French news site.

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,920
 News.co.au it's Australian news site.

120
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,840
 They're all running the same article word for word but they're all associated foreign

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
 press so if you're not familiar with it.

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,800
 A lot of newspapers don't have a whole team of journalists.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 They'll get wires.

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,160
 You have the associated press, you have the associated foreign press and those are the

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,440
 journalists that are out writing articles.

126
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,360
 And then other newspapers subscribe to them basically and then they publish that article

127
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
 in their newspaper on their website.

128
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,800
 So you can't have a journalist in Yemen especially just to cover this whole they're like Clark

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 Kent.

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,960
 You need to go cover this whole thing right now.

131
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,040
 Most newspapers are going to cover that.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,280
 So it makes sense that all these newspapers are running the exact same article word for

133
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,360
 word.

134
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,520
 Why though is my question.

135
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
 Why?

136
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,800
 Because the whole has been there for millions of years.

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,600
 There's no new activity with it whatsoever.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 Not breaking news.

139
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
 It's just a hole in the ground.

140
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
 It's not going anywhere.

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,720
 Literally it's just a hole in the ground.

142
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,080
 When I read this article on the coast to coast A&W website they always cover weird stuff

143
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,440
 but when I started seeing this article pop up on all these mainstream sites and it's

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,680
 not breaking news why?

145
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
 Why are they publishing it now?

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,920
 And it reminded me of an episode I did a while back called There is no conspiracy where I

147
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,760
 got contacted by a listener who will remain unnamed and said that they had a conspiracy

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,400
 that conspiracy theories are actually used to pass on insider information for stock market

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
 stock.

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 When he presented a little bit of proof that would show that it can be correct and the theory

151
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,480
 is that when you see a conspiracy theory pop up where it's talking about you will eat bugs,

152
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 eat bugs.

153
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,400
 That's really not really trying to get people to eat bugs.

154
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,520
 What it means is that someone at a company who has stock in bugs in Ants Inc.

155
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,240
 They know that their stock is going to go up and so they start this conspiracy theory

156
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,680
 and then other people know to invest in these bug-based businesses.

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,520
 That's the theory behind the conspiracy theory.

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,880
 There is no conspiracy theory.

159
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,640
 When you start to see conspiracy theories pop up about microchips in your arm that means

160
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,000
 someone is actually saying hey now's the time to invest in a new chips coming out.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
 If you see a new chip coming out, Intel is coming out, that's going to blow up and that's

162
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,040
 basically the idea behind this very, very interesting way to look at it.

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,480
 It would be the perfect way to spread information and people not know what you're actually trying

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 to say.

165
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,560
 Lunatics will just believe it and they won't even question it.

166
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,080
 They'll run with it.

167
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,800
 But the people who the information is really there for sees it.

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 And actually that's kind of the plot.

169
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
 I've talked about this movie before.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,560
 It's kind of the plot of Under the Silver Lake, which I highly recommend watching that

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
 movie.

172
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,880
 Under the Silver Lake is just brilliant.

173
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,200
 But so what does this have to do with a hole in the ground in Yemen?

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 It's a test.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 It's a test.

176
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
 There's a couple things going on here.

177
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,880
 One is it's a puff piece written by the Associated Foreign Press and it's a fun little story that

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,580
 they knew would get traction because people do like hearing about weird stuff.

179
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,320
 People really, really do.

180
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,600
 So it's just that.

181
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,200
 The other thing, the other theory is this theory.

182
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
 There is no conspiracy theory.

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
 I'm putting this out as a test.

184
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
 Let's see if something, and now this isn't like predictive programming.

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,760
 This isn't like predictive programming.

186
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,720
 I'm not saying there's going to be an earthquake in Yemen.

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,920
 I'm not saying there's going to be a disaster or a civil war.

188
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,440
 There is currently a conflict going on over there right now.

189
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
 I'm not saying anything like that.

190
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,480
 Predictive programming is some made up thing that started like at the early predictive programming.

191
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 I don't want to go into it.

192
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,760
 I go into it all the time.

193
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
 Supposedly the Illuminati has to tell you what they're going to do before they do it,

194
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,840
 but no one can find an example before the Titanic.

195
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,440
 And then there's really no examples between the Titanic and the Simpsons predicting 9/11.

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,560
 There's no predictive programming of the Rise of Hitler.

197
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,040
 There's no predictive programming of the fall of Saigon.

198
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
 You know what I mean?

199
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
 Like there's all these other events.

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,560
 There's no predictive programming of the bombing, like the Lockerbie bombing.

201
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,880
 There's no predictive programming of all this other stuff.

202
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
 So anyway, I'm not, this is what I'm saying.

203
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
 It's not predictive programming.

204
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,080
 It's a made up thing to explain why when you watch a show, when you're stoned, it reminds

205
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
 you of a terrorist attack or something that happened four years earlier.

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 I'm not talking about that.

207
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,600
 I'm talking about economic.

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,520
 I want to see if something happens in Yemen that is a massive economic boom.

209
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,800
 A diamond mind is found.

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,120
 Oil rich area is discovered.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,440
 That's what we should look for.

212
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,920
 Because this is a good testing thing.

213
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,680
 This is a bizarre article.

214
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,240
 It just popped up and you get published in these newspapers.

215
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 Any new has happened.

216
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
 Nothing happens in the story.

217
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,760
 Nothing changes.

218
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,120
 So why are they reporting now?

219
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,560
 Let's see if there is some sort of big economic windfall for Yemen or companies in Yemen.

220
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,280
 So I wanted to get this story out as soon as I could because I thought that would be

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
 a cool little test.

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,240
 And if it's nothing, then that's fair.

223
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,400
 That's fine.

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,920
 But again, it's not predictive programming.

225
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,360
 We're looking at economic increases in companies in Yemen, resources in Yemen, etc.

226
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,600
 Let's see if you're already having to subscribe to a Yemen newspaper.

227
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,560
 You're like, "Dude, I can't even read Yemenese."

228
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,720
 Whatever language it is, well, you will learn.

229
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,840
 We'll learn the language together.

230
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,960
 Denise, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the dead rabbit robot.

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,120
 We're going to take a nice long, watery journey across the ocean.

232
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
 We're headed back to the United States.

233
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
 Specifically, we're headed to Norman, Oklahoma.

234
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
 Splash.

235
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
 Splash.

236
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,280
 We're getting nice, cool seawater in our faces.

237
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
 Dolphins are blowing water out of their blows.

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
 And for that's kind of disgusting.

239
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
 It's all body temperature.

240
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,200
 We're like, "Ah!"

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
 But anyways, they follow us all the way to Norman, Oklahoma.

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,200
 There's a giant river that leads there.

243
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,920
 We're headed to the Twisted Oaks Apartments.

244
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,680
 That's the perfect name for a spooky, spooky place.

245
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,840
 In Norman, Oklahoma, it's March 28th, 2004.

246
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,760
 If you're from this area, you probably know this story.

247
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
 I'd be shocked if you didn't.

248
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:02,160
 This has all the makings of a perfect urban legend, but it's 100% true.

249
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,440
 A group of children from Twisted Oaks Apartments are having a little goonie day.

250
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,360
 They're out doing goonie stuff.

251
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,040
 They're walking through a wooded area around the complex.

252
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
 They normally don't go out this far into the woods, but it's an adventurous day.

253
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,680
 It's March 28th.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,440
 Everyone knows in Norman, Oklahoma, that's the most adventurous day ever.

255
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
 There's a group of the kids.

256
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,280
 They range from age 6 to 16, and they're just kind of tromping through the woods, looking

257
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 for adventure.

258
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:35,320
 And as they're walking, one of them sees a bone laying on the ground.

259
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,920
 That's not a bone, you numbskull.

260
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
 That's some sort of prop.

261
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,880
 Well, I mean, it might be a prop.

262
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 It's shaped like a bone.

263
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,760
 I'm going to carry it with me.

264
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 I'm going to pretend I'm a cave, man.

265
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
 I'm going to be non-on this prop.

266
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,120
 I'm going to be non-on this fake bone for the rest of the story.

267
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
 And they're like, what?

268
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
 This story?

269
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,640
 The kid gives a little wink at the camera as he knows what's coming.

270
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,360
 And he's still non-on this prop.

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,160
 Nah, nah, nah.

272
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,720
 They're walking through this forest, and they see a tree up ahead.

273
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,560
 And sure enough, there is a Halloween prop there.

274
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,920
 It's half of a human body hanging from a tree by a chain wrapped around its neck.

275
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,640
 And it's just slowly swaying in the breeze.

276
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
 Now it's March.

277
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,440
 Halloween was a long time ago.

278
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,840
 This is farther off into the woods, so they figured someone must have been pulling a prank.

279
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,920
 They got this all-wink decoration.

280
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,760
 The reason why they know it's all a wing decoration, it's not a real person.

281
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,400
 They can tell that because it's just dried and crumbly.

282
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,480
 Just swinging there.

283
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 The lower body is gone.

284
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,960
 It was just from the waist up.

285
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,000
 And they could tell it was of a woman, but just a prop.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,880
 So the kids figure, you know, it's a shame that this disgusting thing is in the middle

287
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 of nowhere.

288
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,680
 Let's take it back home and start scaring people with it because it is quite terrifying.

289
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,120
 This is a really good effect, but it's not a human body, right?

290
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
 It is dried up.

291
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,720
 The skin is all crinkly.

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,760
 It seems fake, but it's not.

293
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,600
 It actually is the body of a missing woman.

294
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,520
 But they don't know that.

295
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,120
 They just think it's a very, very realistic Halloween prop.

296
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,400
 They go, "Dude, let's take it home.

297
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
 This will be so funny."

298
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,000
 Well, it's going to scare people with it, so they are able to get the chain off of

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
 the branch.

300
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,960
 And they're now dragging half of a woman's body across the forest floor.

301
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,360
 They get to the apartment complex and these kids, some of the kids at this point are kind

302
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,600
 of thinking, "I don't know.

303
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
 Those eyes are a little too realistic."

304
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,840
 And the fact that there's a ghost floating behind us warning us, "I'm out."

305
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,560
 One of the older kids actually was like, "I'm pretty sure that's a real person."

306
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,880
 And they started making fun of them.

307
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,000
 They're like, "Loser, loser."

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,560
 And he's like, "Oh, you want me to lose her all you want?

309
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,680
 I'm not going to be an accessory to this crime."

310
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,480
 He went and he called the police.

311
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,040
 But these kids are dragging this body through the apartment complex.

312
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
 No one's saying anything.

313
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,760
 They drag it by a pool.

314
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
 They drag it by a pool.

315
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,080
 People are just swimming and they're dragging it.

316
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,320
 And then finally a parent comes out because she had seen them through the window and she

317
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 was like, "What in the world is going on?"

318
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,200
 And she came out and she screamed.

319
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,600
 She immediately realized that this was a real human body.

320
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,960
 One of the kids was quoted as saying, because he was like, "Golly, it's a real body."

321
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,840
 That wasn't his quote.

322
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
 That wasn't his quote, right?

323
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,520
 It just didn't take place in Mayberry.

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,520
 But he goes, when he found out it was a real body, he was saying, "I was about to take

325
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
 it home."

326
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
 This was his master plan.

327
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,720
 He was going to take home this Halloween prop he found in the middle of nowhere.

328
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,920
 He was going to take it into his house.

329
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,360
 He was going to put it in his mom's bed and cover it up with a blanket.

330
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,160
 So when his mom would come home from a hard day of work, she's like, "Oh, it's so hard

331
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,560
 being a mom raising those kids, but I love them all."

332
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,760
 Especially my oldest one.

333
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,440
 He would never wring my heart.

334
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,320
 And then she would go and she would throw open the blanket and there would be a human

335
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 corpse.

336
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,960
 That's so gross and that's an amazing prank.

337
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,800
 But the jokes end here.

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 There probably shouldn't have been anywhere in this story, honestly.

339
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,320
 The jokes end here because when the police show up, they are able to take this body back

340
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,160
 to the morgue and they have the coroner take a look at it and they find out who it is.

341
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,360
 It was a real missing woman.

342
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:40,440
 Six months earlier in September of 2003, six months, Anna Marie Atkinson, 27-year-old woman,

343
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,160
 left a suicide note in her journal and walked out of her house.

344
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,760
 Her journal was found by her family.

345
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,080
 They immediately called the police.

346
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,280
 They are calling her friends.

347
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
 Everyone begins looking for this woman.

348
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,960
 They can't find her anywhere.

349
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,880
 And in the search for Anna Marie, because you want to help them, police are reviewing surveillance

350
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 footage from the area.

351
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,960
 They see Anna Marie.

352
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,240
 This is the last time she was ever caught on video.

353
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,360
 She was seen walking out of a Walmart.

354
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,160
 She had just bought a length of chain.

355
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,480
 Then there was a bit of a communication.

356
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,040
 The search was actually called off in just two days because someone had told her, "When

357
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,720
 you're 27 years old, it's really hard for the missing people thing."

358
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,000
 You figure the daughter was from another town.

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,760
 She was visiting the area.

360
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,280
 She was visiting her parents.

361
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,000
 She might have just went back to another town and the mom and the family was getting reports

362
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
 that no, Anna Marie is fine.

363
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,840
 She is back in her other town that she's at, which was like an hour or two away.

364
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,760
 And the mom told the police, "Well, I think Anna Marie is safe because she's been reported

365
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
 sighting in the town where she lives as well."

366
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,920
 So the police called off the search because although she was a suicide risk, it's much

367
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,640
 harder to locate adults because sometimes adults just leave.

368
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,560
 Sometimes adults do just walk out on their family.

369
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,680
 They just walk away.

370
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 So what are you going to do?

371
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
 Make them come back once.

372
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,600
 And think of you walk out on your family if you're primary breadwinner, you could have

373
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 to pitch out support.

374
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 But I mean, you can just leave.

375
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 And that has happened.

376
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
 The police have been like, "You're a missing person."

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 They're like, "Well, I don't want anyone to find me, so buzz off."

378
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,520
 But it was never confirmed.

379
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,980
 It was never confirmed that she was in Ponca City.

380
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,480
 That was the nearby city she was reported to be in.

381
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 It was never confirmed.

382
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,960
 And it turns out that she had most likely hung herself shortly after she'd bought that

383
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
 chain.

384
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,640
 She walked out into the middle of the woods and climbed up a tall tree and hung herself.

385
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,760
 And just swung there day and night, drying up, falling apart, until a couple of boys

386
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,200
 on an adventurous afternoon found her.

387
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,840
 Creepy story.

388
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 Creepy story.

389
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
 Tragic ending.

390
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,600
 Obviously, you would want it to be either a prop, right?

391
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,760
 Or not a suicide, right?

392
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,440
 I mean, it would be, it would also be, it's like, "Oh no, it was a homicide."

393
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 It was like, "Oh, that's much better."

394
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 But you know what I mean?

395
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,720
 Like, it's just tragic story all around.

396
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,800
 And it has all the makings of an urban legend.

397
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,160
 Like, if that article wasn't published in the newspaper, it was published in a local

398
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,600
 paper called The Oklahoman.

399
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,160
 I wouldn't, it's not that I wouldn't have believed it, but I would have been suspicious.

400
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,200
 And if my older brother had told me that story, I would have believed it as a child, but as

401
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,160
 an adult, I wouldn't have.

402
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 It's too farfetched.

403
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,840
 How do these kids think that this human body that has the perfect intestines hanging out

404
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 of it?

405
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,120
 Because I've seen a lot of intestines and I can tell a perfect one from a fake one.

406
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
 But no, it's true.

407
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
 It's true.

408
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
 It's not an urban legend.

409
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
 It's quite terrifying.

410
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
 Quite terrifying and quite tragic.

411
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,640
 So let's go to move on to our next story.

412
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,000
 Our next story that's not so bummy.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,640
 Unless you're scared, unless you're scared of the supernatural, which is probably why

414
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,040
 you listen to this show.

415
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,440
 Denise, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the world of famous carpenter

416
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,320
 copter we are leaving behind.

417
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,040
 Twisted Oaks apartments.

418
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:21,880
 We are headed out to a small town in Britain.

419
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,840
 We've talked about doppelgangers before.

420
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
 I've shared my own doppelganger experience, I believe, on this show, but I'm going to

421
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,000
 share it again because after over 701 episodes, I can never find it and I can't expect you

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
 to guys to listen to it.

423
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 Interesting story.

424
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,720
 I ran into my doppelganger once and I'm not saying just a dude who looked like me walking

425
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 on the street.

426
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,000
 I was living in these apartments off of Antelope.

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 What was it?

428
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,760
 Was it Antelope and Sunrise?

429
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,240
 So over by the Jack in the Box.

430
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,640
 I don't know that area.

431
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 I don't even know the Jack in the Box is still there.

432
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,320
 I used to live in this apartment complex off of Sunrise and Antelope out in that area.

433
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,000
 I remember once, it's kind of a short story.

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,840
 This was when I was seeing a lot of paranormal stuff.

435
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,800
 I was actively ghost hunting.

436
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,360
 I remember one time I came home from work.

437
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,000
 Trying to remember where I worked.

438
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Circuit City.

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,320
 I don't think I was at Godfather's Pizza at the time, but I was coming home from work.

440
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,640
 Maybe I was coming home from a party.

441
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
 Doesn't matter.

442
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,640
 The point is, is I wasn't at home and I was going there.

443
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,480
 It's probably like not that late at night.

444
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,440
 Maybe 10, 11 o'clock at night.

445
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,280
 I remember I walked into my apartment.

446
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,000
 It was just a nice little apartment.

447
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
 It was my first apartment.

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
 It had the couch right there.

449
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,680
 So when you open the door, you saw the couch and then you could look down the long, spooky

450
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,800
 hallway until you're left with this little kitchen.

451
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,400
 To your right was this big living room for a apartment with this blue and white couch.

452
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,840
 And I opened the door of my apartment and everything seemed fine.

453
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 I wasn't like high or anything like that.

454
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,000
 Open the door to my apartment.

455
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,760
 And I'm sitting on the couch already.

456
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,640
 It's me sitting on the couch wearing the same clothes I'm wearing.

457
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,720
 And I look at him.

458
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,840
 I look at me and he and me looks at me.

459
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,440
 We're looking at each other.

460
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,480
 And there's, it's weird because looking back on it, it's not like there is, I don't know

461
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,880
 if I would describe it as a fight or flight instinct.

462
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,520
 It was just in a, there was a feeling.

463
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,440
 There was something going on there.

464
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,320
 And I remember I walk in the door and I see me sitting on the couch wearing my clothes

465
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,840
 and he stands up and I instinctively begin to walk towards it.

466
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,000
 I feel like I want to fight it, but I didn't have any sort of anger or fear towards it.

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,520
 At least I don't remember those feelings.

468
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,360
 And I get up and I walk towards him and he's walking towards me and then I don't remember

469
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
 what happens.

470
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,280
 Seriously, Jason, he's been more talking about Jaguar in the box.

471
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,720
 He's been more talking about whether or not Jaguar is in the, that's the end of your story.

472
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,040
 I don't remember what happens.

473
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,600
 I remember we got up and woke up in bed next to myself.

474
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
 I'm like, ooh, la la.

475
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,320
 No, I don't remember.

476
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,880
 Like, but it was my doppelganger and it was in my house.

477
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,720
 And it's so funny because every show often, it's not a fear, but when I'm coming home,

478
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,920
 when I go to open the door, I think, what if I'm in there already?

479
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,880
 I just had that sensation the other day.

480
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
 What if I'm in there already?

481
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 What would I do?

482
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
 And the thing you got to think about is how common is this?

483
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,640
 It's funny because when I kind of flipped back and forth about covering this on the show,

484
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,840
 the reason why I want to talk about it was I found two really cool doppelganger stories

485
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
 on Reddit.

486
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,680
 And I was like, oh, those are really cool.

487
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,640
 But then I thought doppelgangers as a concept is so, it's very, very well-known paranormal

488
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
 event.

489
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,200
 I don't really cover stuff about Black Eyed Kids unless I can find a cool angle on it.

490
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,520
 Like I've never done an episode about the infield haunting.

491
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,040
 It's such a well-known thing.

492
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,840
 And I thought, well, doing the doppelganger story, if I tell these doppelganger stories,

493
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
 what am I adding to the lore?

494
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
 Let me tell these stories real quick because I do think I have an interesting twist on

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 them.

496
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,040
 In the United Kingdom, there was a Reddit user named BakedTroop.

497
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
 Let's call her Jennifer.

498
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,760
 And if that's her real name, it's just a stab in the dark.

499
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,280
 It's the last week of school and Jennifer has nothing but summertime on her mind.

500
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,440
 She's ready to get out of this place.

501
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,400
 But you know, she still has to go to school.

502
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,760
 She still can't leave early.

503
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
 She's walking around.

504
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
 She's walking her house.

505
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 She's getting ready for school.

506
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
 She sees her dad.

507
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
 Her and her dad are trading quips.

508
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
 "Ha ha ha!

509
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,440
 Doing finger guns and stuff like that.

510
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
 Sorry, it's in England.

511
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
 Doing finger knives because guns are illegal.

512
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,760
 I think knives are pretty much illegal too."

513
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,500
 She's just joshing with her pops.

514
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,440
 She walks out of the house and she hops on the bus because her friend's like, "Hey Jennifer,

515
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
 aren't you glad this is the last week of school?

516
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
 You bet, Andy!"

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,960
 And they're driving on this bus and they're going to school and she gets a message from

518
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
 her mom on her phone.

519
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 Doodalooop!

520
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,160
 And she looks at her phone.

521
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,760
 And her mom goes, "Did your dad drop you off yet?"

522
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,440
 Jennifer's kind of confused here because last time she saw her dad, her dad was just hanging

523
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,000
 out of the house.

524
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,160
 She messages her mother back, "Uh, no, dad didn't drop me off.

525
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,080
 I'm actually with Andy.

526
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
 We're actually off the bus now.

527
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,880
 We're walking into school.

528
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,760
 So I'm on time, but no.

529
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,440
 Dad didn't drop me off."

530
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,600
 This confuses the mom.

531
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,960
 She says, "Jennifer, you got to ride with dad.

532
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,080
 I know you got to ride with dad.

533
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,240
 I know it for a fact because I saw you in the van with him.

534
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,960
 I saw the family van drive down the street.

535
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,520
 Dad was driving.

536
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,760
 You were looking out of the passenger side window and you waved it to me."

537
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,600
 This point, Jennifer's getting really uneasy.

538
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,160
 It's not like her mom to play a prank, making it really uneasy because she knows that's

539
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,280
 factually incorrect.

540
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,920
 She starts to think, "Well, you know, I do have siblings, but none of them look like

541
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 me.

542
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,120
 I must have been a mistake."

543
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,320
 What in the world could have happened?

544
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,040
 But she tells her mom, "Listen, I took the bus.

545
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,440
 It must have been a mistake.

546
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
 It wasn't me."

547
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,560
 Later, a friend of the family is talking to Jennifer's mom and she goes, "Oh my god.

548
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,280
 It's so nice to see your family just doing family stuff.

549
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,560
 They're not doing finger knives at each other anymore."

550
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,360
 I saw your husband and little Jennifer at the Costco earlier today just sitting there

551
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,880
 having a meal like a father and a daughter should.

552
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,480
 It's the last week of school, but they're still spending time together.

553
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,560
 The mother goes, "Jennifer told me she took the bus to school."

554
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
 The friend goes, "Oh, why?

555
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
 I mean, no.

556
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
 I went and I saw both of them.

557
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,360
 I saw your husband and your daughter Jennifer at Costco and they were eating and Jennifer

558
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,920
 turned to me and she waved."

559
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 Then Jennifer gets home.

560
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,640
 She hears this story as well.

561
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,200
 And now both her and her mom are confused.

562
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,520
 This is one of those stories like, "Would you be scared?"

563
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,680
 There's nothing menacing going on.

564
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,760
 You could keep saying, "Maybe they saw something else.

565
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
 Maybe they saw something else.

566
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
 Maybe they just saw Jennifer-shaped object.

567
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,880
 Maybe it's a cardboard cutout with an automatic waving arm."

568
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,840
 It's not that this person is necessarily threatening, but it's alarming.

569
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,240
 They wait for dad to get home because he would know.

570
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,600
 He would be able to clear all this up.

571
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,040
 Dad gets home and they go, "Hey, honey, settle a bet for me.

572
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,160
 Settle a bet and tell me whether or not I'm insane."

573
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,000
 Jennifer's saying that she got on the bus and went to school.

574
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,600
 The dad goes, "Oh, she did.

575
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,760
 She got on the bus and go to school."

576
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
 Jennifer's like, "Yeah, that's pretty much what I thought."

577
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,560
 And the mom goes, "But I saw Jennifer in the car with you."

578
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,760
 And he goes, "Jennifer was in the car with me."

579
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,480
 Now they're both confused.

580
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,000
 This is the story that dad tells.

581
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,200
 As I was leaving the house, you wanted to ride in the van.

582
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,160
 So I gave you a ride in the van.

583
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,880
 And since it's the last week of school, we went to Costco and we had a nice little meal.

584
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,640
 And we saw that friend.

585
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,200
 We saw that family friend that Jason did not name earlier.

586
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,440
 So she's just a friend.

587
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
 That's her name.

588
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,040
 That's what her parents named her.

589
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 Then you said, "I want to take the bus with my friends.

590
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,560
 So drop me off here and I'll walk and I'll get on the bus and I'll go to the school with

591
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,600
 my friends on the bus."

592
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,240
 So you did take the bus to school, Jennifer, but we went to Costco.

593
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,080
 We went and had a nice little meal.

594
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,880
 And Jennifer's looking at her dad and says, "That didn't happen.

595
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
 That didn't happen.

596
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,800
 I never went out with you to Costco.

597
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 I just got on the bus and left."

598
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 The dad says that Jennifer, she normally loves to play the music really, really loud

599
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 in the car.

600
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,760
 And it was odd that the drive was a little more quiet than normal.

601
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,040
 That you seemed to just stare out the window as we were driving down the road.

602
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,200
 But Jennifer, that was you.

603
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,880
 We went and had a nice little breakfast.

604
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,040
 And then I dropped you off and you ran to the bus.

605
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
 That is a doppelganger story.

606
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,600
 It's very interesting because we have people who are intimately involved with the...

607
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,920
 What would even be the term, "victim"?

608
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
 Who is the victim?

609
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,960
 Is it Jennifer who's being replaced?

610
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,800
 Is it the dad who's being fooled?

611
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,320
 And this is a... it's an interesting story because there are no stakes to this story,

612
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
 right?

613
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,920
 It's not, "Let me in.

614
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,840
 I'm your mother."

615
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,120
 But mother, you're standing in here.

616
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,160
 No, that's the fake one.

617
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
 Let me in.

618
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,040
 So the twist ended in either of them where it's mother and they were a team of serial

619
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
 killers.

620
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
 You know what I mean?

621
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,600
 There's no stakes to this.

622
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,040
 This doppelganger just got a free breakfast.

623
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 So what was going on here?

624
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,600
 And you have four different witnesses to a singular event in different places, different

625
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 angles.

626
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,280
 Really, really interesting doppelganger story.

627
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,080
 Again, it's not just, "I was walking through the woods and I saw myself."

628
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,920
 Which I'm not discounting that.

629
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,160
 That's quite terrifying.

630
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,800
 But something in a distance, a singular...

631
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,920
 Like even my story, right?

632
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,560
 You could say, "Jason, you're having some sort of mental breakdown."

633
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
 You could do all...

634
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,880
 Which is possible, right?

635
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,480
 Not every human being, his brain works 100% of the time in the right way that it should.

636
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,680
 It's an interesting doppelganger story because it's broad daylight.

637
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
 We have multiple witnesses.

638
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,360
 It all takes place in a short period of time and the stakes are so low.

639
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,880
 But let's travel to another destination.

640
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 This one's unknown.

641
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,400
 I have a feeling it's in Britain just because the name of the person.

642
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,280
 This is actually posted by another Reddit user called EveningAd2718, but they actually

643
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,920
 give their real name, Gemma.

644
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,160
 It sounds like a British name, right?

645
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,080
 Gemma, we're in her house.

646
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
 It's early in the morning.

647
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,400
 She's a young, pregnant woman.

648
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,440
 Got a little baby growing inside of her.

649
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,800
 And she's actually staying home from work because she's almost due.

650
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,480
 She's not going to go out having a job.

651
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,120
 But her partner's at work.

652
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,640
 He's out earning the bacon and she's at home with a bun in the oven.

653
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,760
 I just realized how hungry I am.

654
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,960
 One morning he's off to work and she's laying there in bed.

655
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,040
 She's just kind of waking up.

656
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,560
 And she hears him in the room.

657
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,960
 Kind of just laying on her side.

658
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,400
 And she's thinking, that's weird.

659
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,560
 He should already be at work.

660
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,760
 I'm a bit of a slave master.

661
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
 I have a clock.

662
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,480
 I keep track of where he should be.

663
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,280
 She can just tell he should be at work by now.

664
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,920
 But she hears his slippers walking around the bedroom.

665
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
 She hears his voice as well.

666
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,480
 It's not just that the cat got ahold of his slippers.

667
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,960
 She hears him talking and she describes it as, "It sounded scripted."

668
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,720
 Everything he said was the way you would expect someone to talk in the morning.

669
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,200
 It didn't seem to have a soul to the words.

670
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 "Good morning.

671
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,160
 How are you feeling?"

672
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,960
 Her boyfriend says as he's moving about the house.

673
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,200
 "Jemma, can you hear me?"

674
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,320
 That's actually kind of the creepiest one.

675
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
 "I'll be in the shed.

676
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,680
 Call me if you need me."

677
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,880
 She's laying there and she knows he's not in the house.

678
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
 But she's hearing his voice.

679
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
 She can't see him.

680
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,240
 She's just laying there but she can hear this voice talking.

681
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,400
 She's laying there and she notices something.

682
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,600
 They're cats.

683
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
 Whenever he talks.

684
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,880
 Because it's not just one long sentence.

685
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,920
 It doesn't say all that stuff at once apparently.

686
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,600
 It's a conversation that only he's having.

687
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,040
 But when he talks she can see the cat's ears twitch.

688
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,320
 Like they're hearing it as well.

689
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,160
 But they're having no other reaction.

690
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,000
 They're not reacting like there's some sort of hostile presence in the room.

691
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,840
 Then she hears his voice start to change.

692
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,800
 It starts to make weird noises.

693
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,960
 Then it sounds like her boyfriend is right behind her in bed.

694
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
 It's the morning.

695
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,160
 But she hears his voice right in her ear.

696
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,440
 "Good night, Gemma."

697
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,600
 And then a force pushes against the back of her head and begins to smother her into her

698
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,320
 pillow.

699
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,720
 She begins to fight against this invisible force and for a few seconds she's losing

700
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,600
 that battle.

701
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:28,000
 But then she sits up and other than a few cats she is alone in the house.

702
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,520
 That was actually posted on the ghost subreddit and she says "I think I have a mimic in my

703
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
 house."

704
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,840
 It doesn't fit the idea of what we think of when we think of it as a doppelganger.

705
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,040
 A doppelganger is a physical representation of a person.

706
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,840
 If it was just the voice you could chalk it up to another phenomenon.

707
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:53,160
 The fact that it put physical pressure on her is why I wanted to include it in the doppelganger

708
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,200
 story today.

709
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
 And this one is sinister.

710
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,880
 And it's sinister not only because it tried to kill her, it's kind of the definition of

711
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,960
 sinister right?

712
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,240
 She got a sense that it wasn't her husband.

713
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,440
 And isn't that what a doppelganger really is?

714
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,440
 It's something that is us but not us.

715
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,560
 Ghost is a ghost.

716
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,600
 Demon's a demon.

717
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,160
 Demon can imitate a past on loved one.

718
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,960
 But a doppelganger is something that is trying to fool you while you're alive.

719
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,360
 And the question is, this is really my thing.

720
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,720
 We're going to pull back here for my new show of these two stories.

721
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,240
 And my own experience?

722
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,560
 How often does this happen?

723
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
 How often does this happen?

724
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
 There's an interesting thing, I'm going to put it in the show notes but I'll try to

725
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
 describe it briefly.

726
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,960
 It's called the Charlie Chaplin Test.

727
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,320
 Some of you guys have probably seen this.

728
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,600
 It's just a Charlie Chaplin mask, like a Halloween mask.

729
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,960
 Not like a full head cover but like an old cheap mask you would buy back in the 80s to

730
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,520
 just cover the front of your face.

731
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,480
 You're watching this amazing video to watch.

732
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,640
 I mean obviously if you're driving your car don't watch it right now.

733
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,080
 But it has a Charlie Chaplin mask and it's rotating 360 degrees on this metal pole.

734
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,280
 And you watch it and it's rotating, it's rotating.

735
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,960
 And you're looking at the front face of Charlie Chaplin.

736
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,040
 But as the mask turns around and now you're looking at the concave version of it, it becomes

737
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,960
 3D.

738
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,840
 It becomes a different face and instead of the nose poking out, it's poking in.

739
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,960
 And it's turning now in the opposite direction.

740
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,200
 It's doing none of those things.

741
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,440
 It's doing none of those things.

742
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,120
 The mask is turning 360 degrees.

743
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,360
 But once you can't see the normal facial features and you're seeing the inside of the mask,

744
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:54,840
 your brain cannot comprehend a face moving with a nose pointing in.

745
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,080
 It's impossible.

746
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:03,240
 So it makes you see the nose pointing out, makes you see this hollow face appear 3D towards

747
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,320
 you and moving in the opposite direction.

748
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,640
 Because your brain simply cannot process that information.

749
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,600
 And you're going to watch this video over and over and over again.

750
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,440
 The second the mask, the front of the mask disappears, it goes, rotates out of your vision,

751
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,240
 it turns the opposite direction.

752
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,600
 You can't visualize something that your brain doesn't understand.

753
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,120
 And that is the key to so much paranormal stuff.

754
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,840
 You will see stuff in your life.

755
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
 You have.

756
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
 I can guarantee you.

757
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,600
 You have, people who say I've never seen anything paranormal, you have.

758
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,320
 Your brain won't let you comprehend it.

759
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,360
 And so I wonder how many times we see doppelgangers out there.

760
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,720
 How many times we've seen ourselves or other people in locations they shouldn't be.

761
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,480
 And our brain just goes, no.

762
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
 That's not right.

763
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,080
 How common are these doppelgangers?

764
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,880
 How common is this type of activity?

765
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,160
 It may happen a lot more than we think and we're just not aware of it or we see it and

766
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,600
 our brain just goes, no, we can't comprehend that.

767
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,960
 And only in certain moments can we.

768
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,360
 And you know what's funny with the first doppelganger story, that wouldn't make sense for everyone

769
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,920
 else to see her moving around.

770
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,200
 And it wasn't as reality breaking as the second story where she knew there was no one there.

771
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,280
 Everyone in that story, in the first story, that's what makes it so chilling.

772
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,840
 It was such a normal day.

773
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,480
 And yet this paranormal event happened.

774
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,200
 And you have to wonder how often does this stuff happen?

775
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,200
 I think alien abductions are quite rare on a global scale.

776
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,960
 And I think that my whole thing with ghosts is I think ghosts are quite rare as well,

777
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,120
 which I find puzzling because millions and millions and millions and millions of people

778
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,800
 have died on this planet and there's not millions and millions and millions and millions of

779
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,440
 ghosts.

780
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,040
 So that's always been an interesting conundrum with the ghost phenomenon.

781
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,720
 There's way less ghosts than there should be.

782
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,800
 There should be every single square foot of land should be haunted because somebody died

783
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,440
 a violent death everywhere at this point in human history.

784
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,480
 Are they more common than a UFO abduction?

785
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
 Are they less?

786
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
 We don't see a lot of stories with them.

787
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,120
 But actually let's wrap this episode up.

788
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,480
 That was just me kind of philosophizing on it.

789
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,800
 I think actually the scariest thing about doppelgangers, and this is a real quick wrap up, is let's

790
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,400
 say doppelgangers are not incredibly common, but they're more common than you would think.

791
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,560
 That you most likely have at some point in your life met a loved one's doppelganger.

792
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,480
 You thought it was them you were interacting with them and then you went home and they were

793
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,320
 at home and you don't really think about it.

794
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
 You go that's weird.

795
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,320
 They seem to be pretty fast or maybe you question them and they seem a little puzzled.

796
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,240
 What if that is happening more often than we think?

797
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,560
 And that's all just innocent stuff.

798
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,760
 You're like that's where I saw you in the kitchen, but then I went downstairs and you

799
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
 were in the basement.

800
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,260
 You know it's kind of weird.

801
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,600
 What about those times when you accuse somebody of doing something and they swear up and down

802
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,000
 they didn't do it.

803
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,080
 And you know that they did.

804
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,840
 You saw them there.

805
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,160
 You saw them there.

806
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,320
 Other people saw them there and they swear they didn't do it.

807
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,000
 Maybe in the back of your mind you kind of believe them, but you have to trust your eyes.

808
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,540
 If doppelgangers are real and multiple people can mistake them for you, what about people

809
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,960
 convicted of crimes that they swear they didn't do it?

810
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,680
 Relationships that ended because they swear they didn't cheat on you.

811
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,840
 What if doppelgangers are one of the most common paranormal phenomenon and not only is it the

812
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,160
 most common, it's actually the most disastrous.

813
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,480
 Someone sees a ghost walking around your house.

814
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,000
 You're not going to accuse somebody of adultery.

815
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,180
 And if you saw your loved one at a bar with somebody else, but they were really sleeping

816
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,820
 at home in bed waiting for you.

817
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,260
 Doppelgangers may be the most dangerous paranormal phenomenon out there.

818
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:31,340
 How can you know what's true when you can't even trust your own eyes?

819
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,820
