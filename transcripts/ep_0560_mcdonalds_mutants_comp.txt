 fast food, it's all around us. Everyone loves it, it's super nutritious, and it's
 good for you, it helps your bones grow. But did you know that there are actually
 several conspiracy theories surrounding fast food? First off, we're gonna find out
 what's really in a McDonald's hamburger. Secondly, that might not be true, but we'll
 get another story about something that's in a McDonald's hamburger, and then we
 will take a look at probably one of the grossest conspiracy theories out there,
 involving food. And this one has a surprise twist ending today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason
 Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Now,
 one of two things are going on. One, if you're watching on YouTube, you actually see me in
 the middle of a city right above the cafe square, and a guy in a business suit is
 riding by on a skateboard. I'm going to try to do video, but don't worry, loyal
 podcast listeners. I'm not gonna be doing a bunch of episodes where I'm like, "Hey,
 let's watch this clip," or "Hey, let's do that," so because I hate that when I listen
 to podcasts, when I have to use another alternative method. However, if you do use
 YouTube, now you see me and the guy in the business suit on the skateboard. Let's go
 ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Bonkelman. Everyone give a
 round of applause to Bonkelman. He comes walking in, he has a little like, "Soon on,
 he's right in an skateboard." Awesome, Bonkelman. You're gonna be our captain, our
 pilot this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help
 get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. So, Bonkelman, just
 yesterday we were at a top secret McDonald's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
 We were never able to wrap up that mystery, but while I was looking into that, I found
 all these other fast food conspiracy theories that I wanted to talk about today. Originally,
 originally I was gonna do a whole week of these, but today we're just hanging out.
 We're just hanging out on the couch. Bonkelman walks in, everyone's like, "What's up?"
 And he has the keys to the Jason Jalopy. He's gonna take us for a drive. We're
 going to McDonald's. A lot of McDonald's, a lot of McDonald's stories, and they're
 all bad. So strap in if you own Stock McDonald's or if you like eating there,
 because these stories get gross. Bonkelman, I want you to drive us all the way out to
 the deep south. Bonkelman's driving us out to Atlanta, Georgia. And as we're headed
 out to Atlanta, go ahead and hit that time travel button. We are headed out to the
 year 1978. We're driving through Atlanta, Georgia. We see people out on the street
 corners. That's normal. People are allowed to walk. People are allowed to leave their
 homes. Back then, at least. It's Atlanta, Georgia. We see people on street corners.
 They're holding signs. Down with McDonald's. Down with McDonald's. They're
 chanting. We're like, "What? We're driving through the neighborhood." "Boom! McDonald's
 sucks." We're like, "Huh?" I mean, it's not the best fast food, but I definitely want to
 say it sucks. It's a couple levels above Arby's, at least. And then we see a guy.
 He has like a little like chain, right? We're ever thrown on him, right? He's like
 an environmentalist guy, but his chain's not around. That's what environmentalists
 they just walk around covered in chains. They're all Jacob Marley. You know how
 environmentalists will chain themselves to trees? Well, this guy is
 chained to the earth. He's chained to the dirt. And he's like, "McDonald's ain't
 getting none of this dirt." We're like, "What? Why do they want the dirt?" And he's
 like, "Oh, you don't know?" We're like, "No, we don't know." And he's grabbing handfuls of
 mud. We're starting to think it just might be his fetish. He doesn't care anything
 about the environment. He's like, "I just live laying in mud and being chained up."
 He's playing with mud and he goes, "This mud contains the ingredient, the main
 ingredient in McDonald's hamburgers." He's like, "Okay, maybe not the mud itself.
 Maybe I'm going too far with this setup." But he reaches in the mud and he pulls
 out a big handful of earthworms and they're squirmy. They're all like gross
 and bloated and stuff. He's holding them right in front of our face like an
 old-timey 3D movie. He's like, "Ah, this is what they put in McDonald's hamburgers."
 And he's holding the worms out in front of us. This is a really interesting
 conspiracy theory because this is one where we have dates and times for how
 this story started, which is really rare. Like, people still can't decide on the
 origins of Bloody Mary. There's a lot of people can't really decide on the origin
 of the white lady who gets in your car because she died during prom and she's
 hoping to get home or something like that. I always thought that one was kind of
 lame. But you know what I mean? Like, we have these old urban legends, little kids,
 little kids push your car. That's just when you have a lot of kids and your
 car breaks down. That's where that urban legend started. Some lazy dad was like,
 "Billy, Johnny, get out and start pushing this car." But you know what I mean? We have
 all these urban legends. It's rare when we can figure out where they started from.
 This one started on August 15th, 1978. I got most of this information from
 Snopes. They were able to really track this back to get the story. August 15th,
 1978, Wendy's. Wendy herself gets a phone call and someone goes, "Hey, one of my
 neighbors said that your food has worms in it." Wendy's looks side to side. She's like,
 "Uh-oh." They found out. She's like, "No, no, no." That's not true. So that was to the end of the phone call.
 So basically, Wendy's first in August of 1978 started to have this rumor spread
 about them that worm meat was used to fill out the burgers. Nowadays, someone
 tweets something and it's like either a big thing or doesn't catch off. It
 depends what the bots want, right? There's really no humans left on Twitter.
 It depends on what the bots want to push. But someone can make a legit complaint
 and it never gets any traction. And someone makes some sort of claim that
 Wendy's burgers are made of worms and what the bots decide will be popular is
 what's popular. But they used to not be that. There used to be a time where you
 could, I guess you could still do it today. Phone still exists, but before
 Twitter, where am I going with this? The point is, is that back in the good old days,
 you could make a phone call to Wendy's corporate and within a couple weeks,
 Wendy's had to put out a press conference. They had to come before the
 people of the South. This was just a regional thing, but it was catching fire.
 Wendy's by September 15th, so a month later, held a public press conference to
 say there are no worms in our burgers. And people are like, "Uh-huh, okay."
 That's all we just want to know, Wendy's was a real person and she showed up. So,
 that was kind of the end of it. But of course, I'm talking about McDonald's
 conspiracy theories because very shortly afterwards, the conspiracy theory
 changed. Now it was worms in McDonald's burgers. I assume the story shifted
 because a Wendy's shaped silhouette was walking out of the, walking out of like
 an alleyway one day and reporters walking on the street, meaning "pspsps" come here.
 You know that thing about worms in my food? I mean worms in Wendy's food? That was
 lie. It's all about McDonald's. So anyways, the rumor starts with McDonald's now.
 So for whatever reason, McDonald's got hit even harder by this thing. Part of it
 could be that, so at September 15th, was when Wendy's disputed it a month later.
 It quickly switched to McDonald's. It took them until November 23rd to
 address it. But the people at McDonald's were kind of scratching their heads.
 They're like, "This doesn't make sense. We don't have worms in our burgers." And
 what's funny is that there, Wendy's was basically just like, "No, we don't have
 worms in our burgers. That's the end of it." Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, I
 know he bought the company from two other guys, but Ray Kroc is kind of the guy
 who made it into the juggernaut it is today. When he found out about this rumor,
 he actually addressed the rumor himself, because reporters are asking about it. He
 goes, "No, and I'll tell you why we don't have worms in our meat. Worm meat is very
 expensive." He said, "We get slabs of meat so cheap." He goes, "Worms actually cost
 the more." They're, I guess, harder to catch. I guess you need to be six years old
 and have a little shovel. You have to wait for a rainy day. Imagine if you had a
 wait for a rainy day to slaughter all those cows. They're harder to catch.
 They're more expensive to process. You have competition. People are trying to
 buy them for bait or that suspicious bird-shaped shop sitting on the edge of
 town and there's a bird wearing a giant trench coat. He's like, "I have more worms
 for me." But anyways, the McDonald's got hit really hard. You had some
 franchisees of McDonald's lose up to 30% of their business due to this
 rumor. Because who wants to eat a worm burger? I'll answer that in a second, but
 who really wants to eat a worm burger? You're not. Most people would answer no.
 It spread out of Atlanta. It started to get into Ohio. This rumor was getting
 really, really popular back then. Eventually, on November 23rd, they held a
 press conference. They said, "We don't have worm meat. Rake croc runs on stage."
 He's like, "You know how expensive worms are?" I looked into it. I was gonna make
 worm burgers, but I couldn't. They're like pushing them off stage. They're like,
 "Dude, you're not healthy." He's like, "What? What?" I mean, they look tasty, right?
 He's a bird. He's a bird in a trench coat. Rake, squawk. So anyways, the rumor
 dies down. And then, like, I don't know, a couple weeks later, a month later, a new
 rumor starts. You see, McDonald's hamburgers, McDonald's hamburgers have to
 have meat in them. But what is meat? People are asking each other on the street.
 They're like, "Literally, I don't know what's meat. I've been eating clay this
 whole time." 100% beef is how they list their hamburgers. These rumor mongers
 were saying, "If you took cow eyeballs, it's out of a cow, right? Everything that
 is... everything comes out of a cow's beef that swallows a tungsten rod. It's beef
 now. It's all beef. So they're taking cow eyeballs and squishing them up. I told
 you this is gonna be... you're eating a big mac right now. You're like, "I can do the
 worms." But this is gross. They're taking out cow eyeballs and squishing them up.
 And McDonald's again disputed this one, and they go, "No joke. This was their
 answer for this." Do you know how expensive eyeballs are? They said eyeballs are one
 of the most expensive parts of a cow. Because McDonald's is buying their beef,
 but the eyeballs are being sent to research laboratories. You can get, what,
 50 pounds of beef, but each cow, no matter how big or small they are, they only got
 two eyeballs. So those are very, very valuable to research people. And then
 they're squishing them. They're turning them into mayonnaise. They're like, "Mmm, so
 delicious on my McDonald's hamburger." So there's your visual. There's your
 mayonnaise visual for the day. Then... I'm not just gonna list off conspiracy theories,
 but I thought these three were the funniest. And then we'll get into some
 creepy ones. And then people started saying, "Okay, okay. Are eyeball plans in
 the world? Do you have a laboratory?" Wendy's is there, and Jack and the janitor
 from Arby's, that's their highest rank and associate, and Colonel Sanders is there,
 and they're like, "Dang it. McDonald's is impervious to our lives." So they didn't
 believe the eyeball thing. Arby's is right down the stuff. He's like, "Mmm, eyeballs in
 my sandwiches. That'll make them taste even better." So one more rumor started
 up about McDonald's. They do say that they come from a hundred percent beef. This
 one's actually kind of clever. Someone really had it out for McDonald's, maybe
 because they were the cock of the block. They were the big boys. But they said that...
 Oh, so it said 100% beef. 100% beef on these burgers. They were saying, the
 conspiracy started, that they weren't 100% beef. They were worms and eyeballs and
 all sorts of tungsten rods, all sorts of stuff. That McDonald's was actually
 buying their meat from a company called 100% beef. So they could say, "Our
 burgers are 100% beef." And it would be true. And McDonald's is like, "That's
 that one. It's a little clever, but it's not true. We actually have all of our
 stuff graded and everything. It might be D's and C's, but it's a grade, baby." So
 anyways, all those conspiracy theories popped up all relatively around the same
 time. But then you have the creepier ones.
 Bunkleman, let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Jett. We're gonna leave behind
 Atlanta, Georgia. We are headed out to a research facility in the middle of Brazil.
 Bunkleman lands his jet in the middle of the rainforest. We're walking around.
 We're hacking it with our machetes. Chop, chop, chop. We're sending stuff on fire to
 make it super easy. Oh, my arms cramp. And I just burn a path. Burnin' it up. We
 find a secret facility in the middle of the Amazon jungle. It's not super
 secret because there's a giant golden arches on the top of the building. And
 they have a sign outside that says, "Over 60 billion dissected." And we're like,
 "Huh?" And so we have key codes. We beat up some dudes. We took their key cards. They
 didn't even work there. We just wanted to beat them up. Then we had to beat up
 some other guys. We take their key cards. We're able to access this secret
 Brazilian facility. This story popped up. It was super popular in March of 2000,
 which again is an interesting one we can find. I guess nowadays because so many
 rumors are spread electronically, we probably could track it back easier.
 This one I actually found on a website that I stumbled across. I was
 researching something else. There is a Portuguese website. So it's a Brazilian
 website, but it's in Portuguese. It's called Quatro Cantos, which means four
 corners. It's all about internet legends and conspiracy theories. And it's, there's
 super bizarre stuff on there. In March 2000, this conspiracy goes around. It was
 really popular in Brazil. That there is a secret research facility somewhere in
 the world. And inside it are the cows that McDonald's gets its beef from. It's not
 fair to say that they're cows. It'd be better to say that they were cows at
 some point. It's a real philosophical question. When does a cow stop being a
 cow? So we walk into this research facility and we see this abomination just
 laying there. It has no limbs. So it's just a big old torso laying on a table. But
 you can tell from the way it's undulating that it's alive. Actually, the other thing
 about it would kind of look like a worm. Kind of look like a bill grub. It's kind
 of just has no bones. Bones just get in the way of that delicious meat. Instead,
 it just has cartilage to keep it. What do bones do? Bones keep the body together,
 right? It's not like the super glue, but you know what I mean? Like, if I didn't
 have bones, well, here's the thing. If I didn't have bones in my arms, my arms
 wouldn't work. But if I didn't have arms, I wouldn't worry about it. So my question
 is, like the rib cage, if you got rid of the rib cage, if you took me and turned
 me into a legless, armless, genetically modified monster, and would I need a
 rib cage? I think you would only need a spine. But like, why don't you just get
 rid of all of it? I guess scientists know. I mean, I don't know. Maybe scientists
 know all this stuff. But they're like, Jason, of course, you need to have cartilage
 in your cow monster. It doesn't have any bones. It just has underdeveloped cartilage.
 It has no eyes, no tail, no fur, so it's just as big as a worm. It's a giant worm.
 And its head is the size of a baseball. So a tiny little head has no eyes. It
 doesn't say anything about not having a mouth, but they do just lead tubes into
 its stomach, and they pump food into it, and that's what keeps it growing. It's like a
 balloon, like an organic balloon. And then eventually they slaughter it. So
 that's gross, right? Like, if you... it's one thing, like, the way that we treat
 animals for industrial slaughter, it's pretty... it's barbaric. I'm not gonna
 sugarcoat it. It's barbaric. I was a vegetarian for quite a few years because
 of that. It just got too expensive. Like, at a certain point I was like, well, I do
 not like supporting the industrial slaughter of animals, but at the same time I
 need to eat. Otherwise, I will starve to death. So I ended up switching. Now I eat
 canned raviolis and stuff like that. So it sucks. Like, I totally get it.
 There's... it's... I understand why they do it, because it's industrialized and
 stuff like that, but that's... it's still pretty barbaric. I watched that
 documentary once about that girl who had autism, and she always had a hide-and-
 under-a-blink it. And then there's one of those movie synopses that I, like, barely
 remember the movie. Like, what are you talking about? Her name was like Angus
 Truman, or Truman... I don't know. Truman Angus. She was named after what she loved
 the most, eating cows. She actually... she had suffered from autism, so she carried
 around this giant blanket everywhere and had to hang out in this box that, like,
 squished her. It's a saw movie. Ah, I'm getting them confused. No, she had, like,
 this box that was all cushioned. And she loved cutting animals up. She loved the
 slaughterhouse. That was her favorite job. But what happened was she would go to
 these... she would... that was what she was getting her degree in, and she would go to
 the slaughterhouse, and she... see the cows, like, totally freaking out and getting
 slaughtered. And she's watching this, and she goes, "There's a better way to kill
 these cows." She wasn't, like, the super environment... I'm sure she cares about the
 environment on some level. I'm not saying she's, like, peeing on the ground. Take that,
 Earth. But she also was like, "I understand, like, I'm in the slaughterhouse of
 business. I know how humans need me. It's really good for them. But there's a
 better way to kill 100,000 cows a year," was her thing. I'm not saying don't kill
 the cows. I'm not saying really kill less of them. But we can make them more
 comfortable on their last moments on Earth. So she invented... it's a really
 interesting movie. I wish I could remember the title of it. Angus McDuff. She invented
 this thing where the... can I at least look up her name if you're gonna tell us this
 intriguing story. She set up a slaughterhouse that the cows would get
 hugged as they walked through the slaughterhouse. So it's not like there
 would be workers going like, "Oh, like, rubbing and scratching their belly." It was
 the way that the slaughterhouse was built was before the cows... before the cows
 were basically just like, "It's time to die!" and a guy would chase them around with
 the chainsaw or something. It wasn't that bad, but they'd like shoot them in the
 back of the head and the cows would be freaking out. They could smell the death.
 They could smell the cow poop. They could smell all this horror going on in front
 of them and they're being herded in to this building where you can... there's so
 much blood you can smell the iron oxide in the air. She says, "We're gonna kill them."
 But what if we build like little huggy things for them so they're walking
 through and the sides are like comforting them as they go. Playing lullaby music.
 Aww. And she actually got the... she got like some rich investor to build one of
 these. I think there's a couple of them now. She actually did go about changing a
 lot of things of how people were slaughtering animals. I always thought it
 was an interesting story. Not so interesting that I would look up the
 title for you. I'll put it in the show notes. I'll look it up later. But that is
 the story of the slaughterhouse woman. But where are we going with this? Oh yeah!
 So anyways, you have cows being horribly butchered and so you could see
 someone going, "Listen, what if we can remove that horror element from the
 cow's life by not killing cows?" Or basically like, "No, they're not a
 cow. They're a genetically modified tiny little brain organism. They would
 basically have the personality of an amoeba. They would just sit on a table
 and we feed them food and they plump up and then we chop them up." And you can
 imagine other CEOs looking at the scientists and being like, "That is
 brilliant, my friend. That's horrifying but brilliant." That's not all though,
 because also going around in this same email, it's not just that you're eating
 disgusting genetically modified cow guts with no bones. You're like, "Oh, that's my
 favorite part." Eating this gives you AIDS. So that should be the deal breaker,
 right? We could have moral questions all day long about whether or not to
 eat this cow mutant, but it gives you AIDS and Alzheimer's, which is a terrible
 combination of stuff. So basically what this theory says, not only does McDonald's
 treat cows so horribly they've created a cow monster to get meat from, really the
 bullet point here is eating McDonald's gives you AIDS. That's really the thesis.
 That should have been the first sentence, because other people could have been like,
 "Oh, you know, maybe cows don't need AIDS. Maybe those are overrated for cows."
 Just start it off, eating McDonald's gives you AIDS and then you go, "Gentlemen, now
 that I have your attention, read the rest of this email." But Bonkelman, let's go
 ahead and hop in that carbonar copter. This episode might run a little bit long,
 but I do want to cover this one. Bonkelman, call in that carbonar copter. We
 are leaving behind the Brazilian rain... Previously was the rain force. Now it's
 a beautiful clearing where you can build all sorts of stuff. We are leaving
 behind the Brazilian parking lot and we are headed out to the Netherlands.
 [Demonic mumbling]
 Flying over. We see a little research facility, a lot of research facilities in
 this show. So we land at this research facility and we see a big sign on it and
 it says, "Research facility keep out" and then underneath it says, "A division of
 PepsiCo." We're like, "Oh, that's kind of weird." So we're walking around and we see
 a bunch of protesters outside this research facility and they're like, "Burn it
 down. Burn it down. Burn it down." We're like, "What's going on?" And they go, "Guys,
 listen, you will not believe this." Inside that facility, they are using human
 fetal tissue and putting it inside Pepsi. You know that boy we're both drinking
 Pepsi's were upset. What'd you say? They go, "Yes, human fetal tissue is used to
 flavor Pepsi sodas." This one is so weird because I'm telling you, because I'm
 telling you the reaction that you're having right now is the same reaction I
 had. 100%. Let's get into this. People have been protesting boycotting, really,
 boycotting Pepsi over this. This controversy broke out in 2011 when a
 website called naturalnews.com, which is exactly what it sounds like. It's a
 website that does a lot of holistic stuff, fringe science stuff. They said Pepsi is
 using a line of fetal tissue called HEK293 to flavor their sodas. HEK293 is a
 group of cells that were taken out of a embryos kidney, embryonic kidney. They're
 actually from a child who was aborted back in the 1970s in
 Netherlands. That's what they use with some fetal tissue. They'll use it for
 scientific purposes, stem cells, things like that. So HEK293, this is the
 story that was put forth. HEK293 was a clump of kidney, kidney, embryonic kidney
 cells that were then sold to these research laboratories and they were
 using it as an additive in the flavor of the Pepsi's. And so this started to take
 off, this rumor started to take off really back in 2011 when this article was
 ran. People started looking into it, people started calling up Pepsi, people
 started boycotting Pepsi, and supposedly this company in the Netherlands, known as
 CenoMix, was the one who was doing this research for Pepsi. So think about
 everything we've talked about. We've talked about worms in hamburgers, we've
 talked about eyeballs in hamburgers, McDonald's has had a rough go, we talked
 about that AIDS cow that basically you McDonald's you get AIDS. We get to this
 story in 2011, some things never change, right? What's interesting about this story
 is in 2012 Pepsi came forward and said, you know what, we know you're boycotting
 this because you guys say that we're working with CenoMix and they're using
 fetal tissue to work with our drinks. We as of now are going to stop our
 partnership with CenoMix, please call the boycott off. It was true, in a sense, in
 a sense it was true. So the story was that fetal tissue was being used as a
 flavor additive. What the truth was, was that fetal tissue was involved, that
 was not an exaggeration, it wasn't being added to each can of Pepsi. They were
 using it to taste thousands of flavors a day. Look at this quote here, this is from
 Forbes. A tiny company called CenoMix has been working to use this new
 technology to create food additives. CenoMix has isolated receptors found on
 cells that detect taste and added them to the HEK cells. This allows them to test
 thousands of potential taste additives to see whether they may taste sweet or
 savory with a speed that would be impossible with human taste testers.
 CenoMix has announced collaborations with Pepsi, Nestle, and Coca-Cola. So they
 weren't using it, they weren't like dripping it in with an IV into the Coke
 batch. They were using it to create the flavors in the first place. They could
 just run diet, I'm sure nowadays you could do a lot of that stuff computer-wise.
 I think computers like "bwack, bwack, bwack" face a gross face and they're like
 "get rid of that line or sell it to Arby's." It can taste thousands of
 different combinations faster than a human can. So they actually were using
 this. I find that fascinating. It's gross, it's totally gross, but I also find it
 fascinating because this is the one conspiracy theory of this, that it was
 off the mark. They weren't actually using it as a flavor additive, but they were
 using it to design their flavors in the first place. So that is the story of, or
 multiple stories, of fast food conspiracy theories. I think it's really
 fascinating. Oh, and to its credit, Pepsi said, because again, they really came
 clean on this. They could have just said, "No, it's not true, it's not true." They
 said, "Listen, the Pepsi that you are drinking right now at the press conference
 that does not have fetal tissue in it, fetal tissue never ever touched that
 drink. We use it to design flavors, but it's not actually in the drink." So it's
 again, the story evolved to be extra gross, but I think it's fascinating to see
 the evolution of conspiracy theories, to see how long they stick around. When I
 read that, I read it on some wacky website where they said, "You know that
 Pepsi uses fetal tissue?" And I was like, "Well, that's dumb." And I started looking
 into it because that's what I do, even if I think something's dumb, I'll actually
 study it to see if I'm right and to see and kind of dissect it. Because I love
 how these things work, whether or not I believe in them or moot. I don't believe
 in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but I'll watch two hours of that show a day
 because I enjoy the story and everything like that. But so I looked
 into this and Pepsi was like, "Yeah, kind of." And they ended their contract with
 them and stuff like that. But I find that very, very fascinating. And I think we're
 about to get a whole new bunch of conspiracy theories out there, guys. I
 think that with everything going on in the United States, you have like the
 election and then you have the votes getting disputed and you're gonna have
 these lawsuits and you're gonna have... Strap in, guys, because this next... I
 predict... I don't think there's gonna be a Civil War. I think that's the... whatever.
 But I don't not even think we're close to that. But I think the next five years is
 going to be... it's going to be the golden age of conspiracy theories. We're gonna
 see both sides... we're not both sides. We're gonna see every single side issuing
 conspiracy theories about other people. Some will grow. Organically, some will be
 boosted by the bots of Twitter. Some will die off. The real question is, will we be
 able to talk about them? Will things get so gummed up by algorithms that if you
 talk about this conspiracy theory, you talk about that conspiracy theory, they
 take it down. I actually got hit with a hate crime strike on one of my episodes
 recently. It was... you can check it out. There's nothing in it that was even
 close to that. It was the episode about the woman magically disappearing in
 Paris. So the lady vanishes. It was episode like 550, 553 or something like that.
 Got hit with a hate crime strike against my YouTube channel. There's nothing in
 that episode that even comes close to that. Or any of my episodes really for
 that matter. They're coming down hard on conspiracy content. And I think the
 conspiracy content is going to grow and the hammer is going to keep striking
 down. There was a time where Pepsi or McDonald's would just come out and go
 "That's not true!" and everyone would go "Yeah, that was kind of dumb. Eyeballs do
 cost a lot." And everyone goes home. We're entering an age where even saying
 something like that could get your Twitter account banned. So golden age of
 conspiracy theories is coming up. Will we be allowed to talk about them? Who knows?
 I just figured that's food for thought. As I'm pointing at the camera, that's the
 only... those are the only jokes. That's the only joke that you won't get if... well
