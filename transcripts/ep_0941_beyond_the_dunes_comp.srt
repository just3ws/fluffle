1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 Put down that bull of top ramen.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,240
 Tell your mom.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,760
 No seconds on the tuna casserole please.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,080
 Because today we're going to take a look at a story of a man who is so bent on revenge

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,640
 he would feed his friends.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,280
 The unthinkable.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,560
 And then we travel to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts where a young boy is out playing

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,800
 among the sand dunes.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,760
 Little does he know he's about to see something.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,600
 No modern human was ever meant to discover.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:44,520
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,520
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,640
 It's pretty much just playing a killing floor for me and doing research for even more episodes

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
 for next week.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,120
 But someone who can't wait till next week walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,280
 is one of our long time legacy Patreon supporters.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,040
 Give it up for Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,360
 Woohoo yeah come on in.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,680
 Sticky sweets from her head to her feet.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,440
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,080
 You guys can't swear the Patreon off you guys aren't super tasty that's fine too.

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,000
 Just helps read the word about the show that really really really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,240
 Now we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,600
 So let's go ahead and get started.

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,520
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 Durgible.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,640
 Fly us all the way out to Quebec.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,840
 Specifically we're headed out to Saint Andy Bellevue in Quebec.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,400
 And we're going to stop by MacDonald College.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,120
 Not MacDonald's University which sounds delicious.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
 This story is the opposite of that.

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,480
 It's the most repulsive story that you could positively think of regarding food and we've

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
 covered a lot of gross ones.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
 We're at MacDonald College.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,200
 It's January 1970.

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,440
 And we're walking around school and we're like in the school cafeteria and they're like

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,960
 handing out like muffins and jelly and like pancakes and stuff I'm guessing.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,440
 And we're eating those and into the cafeteria walks Eric Kranz.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,040
 He's this 23 year old student who is currently researching parasiteology.

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
 The study of parasites.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 We're in the middle of taking a bite of a pancake.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
 I was like yeah this is a tough one.

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
 Eric Kranz just loves to be around parasites.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,320
 He's hanging around a bunch of people who borrow money and never give a mini money back.

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,280
 He's like ah my people.

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,760
 He loves looking through microscopes at tiny little eggs and he probably like feeds chickens

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,400
 to snakes and stuff like that.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,320
 They're like Eric stop doing that.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,080
 That's not a definition of a parasite.

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
 He's like yeah it's just fun.

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,520
 Allegedly I should mention very clearly right now this is all alleged.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
 Eric Kranz goes home.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,200
 Now he's currently sharing a home with four roommates.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,440
 Now they didn't get along.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
 This part isn't alleged.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,840
 They did not get along.

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,160
 Eric Kranz and his roommates never saw eye to eye.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,840
 And this all came to a head when one day they're like hey Eric you owe us back rent.

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 Eric's like listen man I'm trying to get the money together.

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
 I already loaned my money off to a bunch of people.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 They're not paying me back.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,640
 Parasiteology has gone too far.

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,480
 They're like Eric you gotta pay us the money.

68
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,600
 This is insane.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 This is insane.

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,800
 Actually the thing we're gonna get to is super insane.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
 But this also blows my mind.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,440
 He owed them $16.66 in back rent.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,880
 Now let's forget the whole 666 thing because you know that's just creepy in and of itself.

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:59,160
 But they were ready to evict this dude because he was short around $17.

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,040
 He was $17 short on his rent and they're like bro pack your bags you gotta get out of here.

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,560
 Now they didn't like the guy right.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
 So they're looking for any reason.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,120
 But apparently there was a lot of debate on this.

79
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
 I found this story online.

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,080
 It was posted by a guy named Delano 1998.

81
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
 He's not a participant in this story.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 Don't go after him.

83
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,960
 Don't try to seek some parasite justice yourself.

84
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,880
 He just posted this.

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,640
 And a lot of people were debating wow $17 and he's getting kicked out.

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,280
 Apparently in 1970 Canadian money that was close to about $130.

87
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,160
 So yeah I could see if someone's behind $130 and you didn't like them.

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,720
 You want to get rid of them.

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,360
 So they're like Eric you gotta pay the money.

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
 You gotta pay the money you owed to us and he's like oh he's not picking up pennies.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,640
 He's like oh now I just need $1665 more and all my troubles are solved.

92
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
 He's getting so upset with these guys.

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,800
 Like again it seems to be a long-brewing thing when they keep on him about paying the rent

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,640
 that he owes he says quote.

95
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,960
 This might be the most specific threat I've ever heard before.

96
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,700
 Normally it's like I'll get you.

97
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,200
 One of these days I'll get you.

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,680
 Then you fly away in your car and inspect your gadgets like oh save the day once again.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,240
 This was his threat.

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 He turned to his roommates.

101
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,320
 They said where's the $16 and 66 cents you owe us.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:29,360
 He's like oh he said quote all put parasites in your food and you'll wake up dead.

103
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,480
 That is such a specific threat and it's coming from someone who could do it because he's

104
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,520
 studying parasitology.

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,120
 He has access to parasites.

106
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,760
 Have I made that threat to someone?

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,200
 You're like Jason you can barely pronounce the word.

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,000
 I doubt you can rummage up more than three or four parasites which would still be too

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
 much to be in your food.

110
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,360
 But you're like I'm not worried about Jason and I'll be like oh get you gadget.

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,560
 They're like when he's not gadget just please give me the $17 you owe me and leave.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
 He owes him money.

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,600
 He threatens them by putting parasites in their food.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,800
 What happens is January 31st rolls around and he comes into the house and he's like

115
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,320
 hey guys I got big news.

116
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,360
 You're $17 and they're like oh yeah we were expecting something better than that but that's

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
 what you owe us.

118
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,640
 You've got to hope someone said you know big news.

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,240
 But fine we'll take the $17.

120
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,480
 He paid them the $17 and yet they evicted him anyways.

121
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
 What crumbums.

122
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,160
 All he did was threaten to put parasites in your food and you're evicting him.

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
 He paid them money.

124
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,720
 They evicted him.

125
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
 But let bygones be bygones right?

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,480
 It's the holiday spirit of Quebec because the first week of February there's a thing

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,600
 called the winter carnival where people dress up like snowmen and they walk around and they

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
 just go ho ho ho and people are like what?

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's just like a snowman.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So no one doesn't say that.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
 They're like just go with it.

132
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
 It's Canada.

133
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
 We do weird stuff up here.

134
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,760
 They have this thing called winter carnival where they just kind of dance around.

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,240
 I didn't research that at all.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,320
 I just go oh winter carnival and then I clicked on Wikipedia and it was like a picture of a

137
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 man in a snowman suit.

138
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,040
 It's like oh that's all the research I need to do on that.

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
 Just one photograph.

140
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 So I don't know.

141
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,680
 It could be like some big religious festival I could have pissed off a whole nation.

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
 Anyways winter carnival and Eric is like you know what guys?

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,400
 I was the crumbum this time.

144
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,360
 I should have paid you that $17 when I owed it.

145
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,000
 So I have decided to serve you a feast.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And he brings in all this food he prepared for winter carnival.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,120
 Let's stop the story right here and I just this is a this isn't a choose your own adventure.

148
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 This is not a logic.

149
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
 This is not a logic question.

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
 It's not a word problem.

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,760
 If someone ever threatened to put parasites in your food and then you evicted them and

152
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:15,560
 then they show back up a couple days later with food would you eat it?

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
 But you know what maybe it's a holiday spirit.

154
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,400
 Maybe bygones be bygones right?

155
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 Old enemies become friends.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,480
 Old people who threatened to feed you parasites become people who don't do that.

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,720
 And he brought in all this food and you accept it as a good friend would right?

158
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,400
 What type of friend would you be if you didn't eat the food of a maniac who threatened to

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
 poison you?

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,040
 So his roommates and apparently like three other people there was a total of seven people

161
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,040
 that got afflicted by what's about to happen.

162
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
 But you can't you have no idea what's coming up next.

163
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
 This true story.

164
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,960
 He brings in all this food they eat it.

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
 They're like oh this is delicious.

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,560
 Oh no no no they're like fighting over the last roll.

167
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,920
 They're like oh man oh man.

168
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,400
 And Eric's probably just sitting there with a big old smile.

169
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,720
 They realize it's weird he didn't eat anything.

170
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,560
 He's like oh I had my winter festival dinner on the way over.

171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,760
 Go ahead and gorge yourselves on this delicious food.

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,960
 About a week later all of the roommates all the four roommates get sick around the same

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
 time.

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,760
 But you know it's winter right?

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,880
 pneumonia is going around.

176
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,380
 People get sick.

177
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,200
 They're coughing.

178
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,360
 They're losing weight pretty rapidly right?

179
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,840
 That's usually not a symptom of the flu.

180
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,720
 These four roommates start to develop a fever as well.

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 They're sweating.

182
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
 They're coughing.

183
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 They're all skinny though.

184
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,640
 They're like oh no take it off the freshman 40.

185
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
 This is great.

186
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,040
 But then all four of them and I'm assuming the other three people showed up for this

187
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
 party.

188
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,840
 I have no idea about the cryptic threat that Eric made.

189
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,600
 They just showed up but they don't play a lot into this later narrative.

190
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,560
 I'm sure they were also incredibly sick.

191
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
 We know about these four roommates cough, weight loss, fever and then this is the most

192
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,880
 troubling of all right?

193
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,720
 You can tank those other three no problem.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,480
 You're like Jason I don't know why you're so blase about having high temperature.

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,040
 They start to feel all four of them feel like they can't breathe.

196
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
 Now that's frightening.

197
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,800
 But on February 12th it goes to full on they can't breathe.

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,200
 Like by February 12th they are actually having a hard time taking a deep breath and they're

199
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,720
 breaking out in hives.

200
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,320
 So at this point it's been like two weeks at this point they go to the hospital and

201
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,720
 they get in there and they're in respiratory distress.

202
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,280
 The doctor's like oh no you guys should have been here a long time ago.

203
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
 You guys look terrible.

204
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
 But you've lost a lot of weight.

205
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
 You look like pretty slim guys.

206
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 They take them in.

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,040
 The doctor, the attending physician brings them in and is treating them and they start

208
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
 treating them for pneumonia.

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
 They're having trouble breathing.

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 All this other stuff.

211
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,480
 So they start treating them for pneumonia and nothing is working.

212
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,880
 And he's like the doctor's like oh man I don't know what else to do.

213
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
 I did one thing.

214
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
 I tried one thing and it didn't work out.

215
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,780
 You guys will be fine.

216
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,040
 Two of them end up in critical condition because they can't breathe.

217
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,520
 February 16th.

218
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,360
 Dude is coughing into like a little tray, a little spit tray.

219
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,160
 And the nurse picks it up and she goes oh yes.

220
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,960
 This is my favorite one of my job.

221
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,160
 I have a fetish for phlegm.

222
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,640
 She takes the tray of phlegm and they're looking at it.

223
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,360
 I'm sure I don't know if they saw this with a naked eye.

224
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,240
 But what they discovered at this point, remember they ate the food on February 1st.

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 The first week of February.

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,600
 It's February 16th now.

227
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,440
 They find a worm in the phlegm.

228
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,960
 And he's coughing up.

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,240
 A four millimeter long worm.

230
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,840
 I wish I could say how big it was first you imagined a giant earthworm.

231
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
 You're like nope.

232
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 You shut off the podcast.

233
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
 You're like I'm done.

234
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,720
 A four millimeter long worm just kind of squiggling around in his phlegm.

235
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,560
 The nurse goes oh I got to tell the doctor about this and the doctor's looking at it and

236
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
 he goes wow.

237
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,000
 Who would have thought that this worm would be inside a human.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,480
 What they found, what this worm was was something known as the escarus sum.

239
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
 It's a round worm found in pigs.

240
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,320
 It lives in pig intestines.

241
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,440
 It's a giant round worm.

242
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,520
 They grow to be about six to twelve inches long.

243
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 They live in pig intestines.

244
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,520
 And the doctor's like you know we've always had theories about these worms getting into

245
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,240
 humans right because maybe like if you ate enough pork products.

246
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,440
 When you're eating so many hot dogs you just start eating the life pig.

247
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
 You're like sucking their intestines up like a string of spaghetti.

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And you ate all the eggs.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,920
 So the doctor's like but this is still weird.

250
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
 We don't even know if it's possible.

251
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,760
 If it is possible it's incredibly rare.

252
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
 How did all these people eat pig intestines?

253
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,720
 We didn't eat pig intestines by the way.

254
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,960
 The patients are like you know what this is starting to make sense because our roommate

255
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,120
 worked in a parasitology lab.

256
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,800
 He threatened to put parasites in our food and the doctors like okay that makes a little

257
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
 more sense.

258
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,360
 They start to do all these tests on the people and these four roommates and they find the

259
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,960
 life cycle of this round worm in these four dudes.

260
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:36,920
 What happens is there's microscopic eggs in their bloodstream that float out of the intestines

261
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,920
 into the bloodstream and then go into the lung.

262
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
 That's why they were having such trouble breathing.

263
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,920
 And part of the life cycle is you would cough up this larva because the egg hatches in your

264
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,920
 lungs so now you got this little worm in you and then you would cough it up along with

265
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
 all the other phlegm and sputum.

266
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
 Right?

267
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,320
 Apparently that's the thing.

268
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,600
 I think it's just a fancy word for phlegm but I think it's like bloody phlegm.

269
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
 Jason please.

270
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,160
 Please just quit giving the visuals.

271
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,120
 They're coughing up these little worms, these little immature worms and they climb up the

272
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,760
 trachea.

273
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,840
 And then you swallow them back down and they go back into your stomach where they become

274
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,320
 mature worms.

275
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,440
 Out of your intestines, into your blood, into your lungs, coughing out of your lungs back

276
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
 in your stomach.

277
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
 The worms journey is complete.

278
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,800
 So what they did was they go we got to get rid of these worms even though this is kind

279
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,280
 of cool scientifically.

280
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,320
 We got to get rid of the worms, the attending physicians, started them on this treatment

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,480
 that's used to kill this type of parasite.

282
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,080
 Pretty much ends the infestation right there.

283
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,200
 But they have like, you figure, okay Jason they have a couple of worms.

284
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 Big deal, big deal.

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,160
 They have a couple of worms in them.

286
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,120
 One of the dudes was full of at least, at least they probably lost count after a certain

287
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
 point.

288
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:11,320
 He had at least 400,000 larva larvae inside of him.

289
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,960
 400,000 wriggling little worms crawling through his body.

290
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
 He's all being tickled all the time.

291
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,120
 He's like, "I didn't know it would be so fun."

292
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
 Trying to throw him up.

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,640
 One dude, it was just coming out of his bowel movements, right?

294
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
 Just worms.

295
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
 He's going poop.

296
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
 A bunch of worms are coming out.

297
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,520
 I would rather be tickled by 400,000 worms than to have one worm come out of my butthole.

298
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
 The doctor said, "This is real serious."

299
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,300
 He goes, "One of these guys, one of these patients, he's going to have permanent

300
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 lung damage."

301
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,240
 Like these worms did such a number on him that he's going to have lung damage for the

302
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 rest of his life.

303
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,960
 Eric, after the roommates and the friends started getting sick, he left Quebec.

304
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 He ditched the place.

305
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,040
 He's like, "I'm done."

306
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,480
 And once his scheme was undone, right?

307
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,040
 Once they figured out what had happened, they actually set out in a restaurant for attempted

308
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,440
 murder.

309
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,780
 On March 9th, 1970, he surrendered himself and they let him out on bail.

310
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,340
 They figured, "What's the worst you can do?

311
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,820
 What's the worst this guy can do with a super villain?"

312
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,580
 He can just infest the world with parasites.

313
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,780
 They let him out on bail.

314
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,740
 June 1971 is when the trial took place.

315
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,260
 And the prosecution was like, "What evidence, what possible evidence do you need?"

316
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,660
 He worked at a parapsytology lab.

317
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,180
 He had access to parasites.

318
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,260
 He threatened to give people parasites.

319
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,300
 People he didn't like had parasites.

320
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,240
 And here's a bunch of photos.

321
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,400
 X-rays of them boogying down in this dude's stomach.

322
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
 Case closed.

323
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,920
 Like, who else could possibly do this?

324
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,480
 Now, his defense lawyer said, "Your Honor, parasites, schmericides."

325
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,080
 He totally blew off the whole thing.

326
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,760
 He goes, "Listen, sure my client worked at a parasite lab, but who knows where they

327
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
 got these parasites?

328
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,860
 It turns out that their kitchen sink was constantly full of sewage for some reason.

329
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,400
 I know college life was hard.

330
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,200
 But that's what the defense lawyer said.

331
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,220
 And the other roommates were like, "No, that's not true.

332
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,220
 That's not true."

333
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
 Their eyes shift from side to side.

334
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,300
 They're like, "Okay, it's a little true."

335
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,940
 But there wasn't so much sewage in our sink that we got parasites.

336
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,020
 And the defense lawyer was like, "Mm-hmm."

337
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,980
 And then the defense lawyer goes, "Okay, well maybe it's not the sewage theory.

338
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,140
 However, yes, my client did work at a parasite lab.

339
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,760
 But this could happen accidentally.

340
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,800
 You see, my client may have gotten some eggs on his clothes.

341
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,840
 Some microscopic eggs, you wouldn't even see him, right?

342
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,680
 He's walking around the lab in his blue jeans and his polo and a couple of roundworm eggs

343
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,600
 end up all over his clothes.

344
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
 It happens to the vestibulus.

345
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
 And then his roommates, maybe when they were kicking him out.

346
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,500
 I don't know, maybe they were going through his clothes.

347
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,940
 Maybe they were packing his bags for him.

348
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
 Who am I to say?

349
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,700
 But it's possible that this guy who threatened to put eggs in people's food didn't actually

350
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
 do it.

351
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,060
 It was an accident from them handling his clothes.

352
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,220
 And Eric won the case.

353
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,820
 Eric was acquitted of this crime.

354
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,020
 He served no jail time for poisoning seven people.

355
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,280
 Sometimes I wrap up these true crime stories with some sort of lesson to be learned or

356
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,960
 some sort of look at the justice system and how corrupt it can be and how they can miss

357
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
 the mark.

358
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,920
 I don't know if there's anything like this.

359
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,480
 I think the moral of this story is if somebody ever threatens to poison you with parasites,

360
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,680
 do not eat their food.

361
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:57,760
 The fact that he got off is it should be shocking, but Canadian justice system is just awful.

362
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,340
 And this guy's still out there, right?

363
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,340
 He was 23 in 1970, so that would make him.

364
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,340
 You're like, "Oh, great, Jason's going to try to do math."

365
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
 This is how I do math.

366
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:15,680
 They go 70 plus 90 is 20, so then he'd be 43 in 1990, and then he'd be 53 in 2000.

367
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,740
 This is really how I do math.

368
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,860
 This guy would be 75 years old now.

369
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860
 He could still be out there.

370
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
 He could still be out there.

371
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,440
 He could be working at a local restaurant.

372
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
 We are at right now.

373
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,520
 If you listen into the squad guest, you're still eating your noodles.

374
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,600
 I told you not to, and then you look over and you see in the kitchen, there's a man

375
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,760
 standing there with a glimmer in his eye and a parasite coming out of his other eye.

376
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,320
 This guy's probably dead by now.

377
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,200
 This guy's messing around with parasites.

378
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,760
 This guy's constantly juggling roundworm eggs.

379
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,480
 He probably infested himself at some point, but it's crazy, bizarre, true crime story

380
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,820
 and absolutely disgusting and lesson or not whether or not there's moral to what I just

381
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,620
 wanted to share it with you.

382
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,100
 Sweet, sweet golden goo.

383
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,420
 Grab that barf bag, get it over with, and I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbon

384
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
 acopter.

385
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,580
 We're leaving behind Quebec.

386
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,780
 We're headed all the way out to Martha's Vineyard.

387
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,900
 The year is 2002.

388
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,060
 It's a beautiful summer and we're spending it in Martha's Vineyard.

389
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,920
 Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.

390
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,720
 Now, the story was posted online by someone going by the name, "You're doing great, sweaty."

391
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,080
 I think they might have misspelled, sweetie.

392
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
 You're doing great, sweaty.

393
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,520
 We're going to go ahead and call this dude Samuel.

394
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 He tells the story.

395
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,840
 This actually happened back when he was between the ages of eight and 10, back in the year

396
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
 2002.

397
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
 He goes, "Listen, I've never told this story before.

398
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,420
 I've never told it to anybody except for my parents because they were there and they wanted

399
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,020
 answers."

400
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:05,540
 Back in 2002, Samuel's family, mom, dad, and him, took a vacation out to Martha's Vineyard.

401
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,460
 He goes, "Listen, I was an excitable child.

402
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,620
 I was always running around and tugging on people's shirts and picking their pockets.

403
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,420
 I was a regular Aladdin.

404
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,100
 I was constantly wanting to explore nature.

405
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,440
 My parents were like, "Sure, Sam, go away.

406
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,120
 Go away playing the bushes.

407
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
 Have fun."

408
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,520
 Somewhere far away from us.

409
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,720
 They fed into his need to explore.

410
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,400
 When they went to Martha's Vineyard, they're actually out on the beach.

411
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,120
 He believes this is somewhere near the Menemasha Hills Beach.

412
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,000
 They're out the beach just having a good time.

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,160
 Everyone's at the beach having a good time.

414
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,560
 It's really hard to be depressed at the beach.

415
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,080
 Maybe you just got stung by jellyfish and you're watching somebody unzip their pants

416
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
 ready to pee on you.

417
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,300
 That's probably the most depressed you could be at the beach.

418
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,180
 But little Sam, he's running around.

419
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
 Woohoo!

420
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,140
 Yeah, this is so much fun.

421
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,940
 And he sees there's this tall series of rocks that some of the teens are climbing up and

422
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,740
 jumping off the rocks into the water.

423
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,420
 And he's like, "Wow, that looks fun, but even being a little eight-year-old, I know that's

424
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,780
 extremely dangerous.

425
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,380
 I want to go exploring instead of risking paralyzation."

426
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,880
 So he decides, "I'm going to see what's on the other side of those rocks.

427
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,320
 Just go for a little kid journey."

428
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,640
 So he goes over the rocks.

429
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,440
 He's kind of walking along and he says, "I'm probably about a half a mile at this point,

430
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,680
 a half a mile from where my parents and everyone else is.

431
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
 I'm kind of alone at this point.

432
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,920
 I see these huge sand dunes."

433
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,560
 Now I actually looked, I couldn't find this exact location.

434
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,200
 I tried looking for this exact location on Google Earth, but I did find, I was looking

435
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,860
 at this beach area.

436
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,620
 And it's interesting because you have beach and then immediately, like it's like sand

437
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,000
 and then heavy greenery.

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,820
 It's just like goes from straight beach to grass.

439
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,620
 In California, it was never like that.

440
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,980
 Like you had the beach, they needed a bunch of rocks that you'd cut your feet on and then

441
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,540
 you had a bunch of paved stuff.

442
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,240
 Usually referred to as a parking lot.

443
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,420
 And then you just had more kind of dusty mountains, kind of rocky mountains and not the rocky

444
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,860
 mountains, but you know, and it was kind of laid out like that, right?

445
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,320
 It was a clear definition between the biomes, but here it's not the case.

446
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 It goes beach, then lush foliage.

447
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,560
 So he's climbing up these huge sand dunes.

448
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,360
 He says they're about 75 to 100 feet tall.

449
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,880
 That might be the exaggeration of an eight year old boy, right?

450
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,600
 Or to an eight year old, everything may seem that tall.

451
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,840
 But he's climbing these dunes and he gets up on the top one of these dunes and he goes,

452
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,680
 "I'm going to see if I can see my family.

453
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,500
 I'm going to get at the top of this dune and I'm going to see if I can see past the big

454
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,380
 rocks and apparently I have the vision of a superhero.

455
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,060
 See if I can see my family way, way over there.

456
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,220
 See if I can pick out my parents from a half a mile away."

457
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,860
 Now he gets at the top of the hill and he can't really see anyone.

458
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,020
 He can't see his parents.

459
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
 He's pretty far away.

460
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,660
 But what he does see at the top of the sand dune, because again, it has this giant lump

461
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,580
 in the earth right next to it.

462
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,800
 It's literally like in the sand, they're like budding up against each other.

463
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,600
 Are these huge bushes?

464
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:22,320
 And he turns and he looks and in one of the bushes is a cave.

465
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,400
 Now not like the bush was on a mountain hiding a cave.

466
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,040
 He said, "It looked like someone actually cut a tunnel through a bush."

467
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,240
 He's sitting there and he's looking at it.

468
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,480
 He goes, "That's pretty weird.

469
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,940
 I've never seen anything like this before.

470
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:45,300
 It looks like someone actually took the time to bore a passageway through this bush."

471
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,020
 And as a young adventurer, he knew that he had to see what was going on.

472
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,500
 So he starts kind of squatting down and walking through this bush.

473
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,140
 It apparently is like a thorn bush.

474
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,180
 And this kid doesn't have his shirt.

475
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,660
 So he's being super careful.

476
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,620
 He's not throwing his arms.

477
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,620
 I'm going, "Wee, wee!"

478
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,940
 He's got to keep it up close to his body and kind of squatting through.

479
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,800
 And he's walking and then he sees a slide.

480
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,080
 Not an actual metal slide, but the earth again looks like it's been formatted as some sort

481
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,960
 of slope.

482
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,120
 Totally man-made.

483
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,240
 Begins to crouch through it and go down this slide.

484
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,720
 He said it had to be about 40 feet going down.

485
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,220
 40 feet, you know, gradual slope.

486
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,540
 And when he gets to the bottom of that, he is now standing in a clearing.

487
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,580
 There's greenery all around him.

488
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,020
 Now he's left the beach, which again is only maybe about 40 feet away.

489
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,940
 And he's in this lush greenery.

490
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,540
 And he says this was, again, it was a clearing.

491
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,500
 I'm standing in this clearing, but everything else was covered by plant life, including

492
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 the sky.

493
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,600
 There's the canopy of bushes and vines.

494
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
 Maybe not vines.

495
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,640
 He didn't specifically get transported to the lost city of gold in the Yucatan or anything.

496
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,560
 But he says, "Even the sky was blocked out by the greenery."

497
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:24,120
 And I'm looking around and it felt like someone had made a home inside of a giant bush.

498
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,800
 He sees another tunnel leading away from this clearing and he walks down that.

499
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,580
 And at that point he begins to hear voices.

500
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,660
 Can't tell what they're saying.

501
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,380
 Can kind of tell where they're coming from.

502
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,140
 It sounds like they're coming from the end of this tunnel, but his curiosity is peaked.

503
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,100
 He's a young boy who goes on adventures all the time.

504
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,780
 He wants to see, he goes, "I wanted to meet the king of the fort."

505
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:58,340
 Like to him, this was some sort of place, some hidden habitat.

506
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,040
 And there had to be a king and he was going to meet him.

507
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,920
 He was going to have so much fun with his new friends.

508
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,840
 So he's walking through this tunnel that's built into this foliage.

509
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,440
 And as he's getting towards the end of it, he sees another clearing, a larger clearing.

510
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,640
 And he sees what he describes as a campfire.

511
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,120
 But he goes, "I can't really say that I saw flames.

512
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,500
 What I saw was a white, yellow, orange light in this clearing."

513
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:40,140
 I assumed it was a campfire, but at this point he says his recollection begins to become blurry.

514
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,780
 He has a hard time remembering super concrete details, but this is what he does remember.

515
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,820
 He's looking through this tunnel.

516
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,880
 He sees the other clearing and what he sees around it is a group of figures.

517
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,460
 A group of... he doesn't like using the word "people" to describe them.

518
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,500
 He kept putting people in air quotes or rail quotes because this is typed out, but he wasn't

519
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,080
 comfortable using the word "people."

520
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,900
 They seemed like something else to him.

521
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,240
 And at this point is when he begins to feel fear.

522
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,580
 He was totally enthusiastic about meeting the king of the fort until he gets a glimpse

523
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,040
 of who is in the clearing.

524
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,220
 Just a fleeting glimpse, right?

525
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,640
 Again, he can't specifically say they were human, but this is when fear begins to overtake

526
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 him.

527
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,800
 He starts to become terrified and specifically gets the thought that, "Oh my God, no one's

528
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,520
 ever going to see me again."

529
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,480
 And once he comes to that conclusion, once he comes to the conclusion, no one will ever

530
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,640
 find me again.

531
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:51,800
 He actually makes an audible gasp and the figures turn to face him.

532
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,460
 He said, "One of them began running straight towards me, straight towards the tunnel I

533
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
 was in."

534
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,060
 And he goes, "Listen, it looked human."

535
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:07,020
 I'm not going to say that they were some sort of alien or monster, but they looked human,

536
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,480
 which is a very interesting wiggle word, right?

537
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,540
 It's like his soul, it's like his senses were telling them they're not human.

538
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,700
 They may look human, but they're not human.

539
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,240
 He said, "This one that's running towards me seems to be holding some sort of long object."

540
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:34,460
 He compared it to a staff or a spear, and he said this man was wearing a ceremonial headdress.

541
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,600
 He goes, "The best I can compare it to is a stereotypical headdress of a Native American."

542
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,780
 He goes, "I'm watching this guy run towards me.

543
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,980
 He's angry.

544
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
 He's running towards me.

545
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,980
 I'm standing in this tunnel.

546
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
 I turn and I run as fast as I can.

547
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,740
 I get to that first clearing, and then I realize that it's a 40-foot ascent, right?

548
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,980
 Up this slide, up this slope, and that tunnel is smaller.

549
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,460
 It's full of thorns.

550
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,180
 This young boy with no shirt begins to run up this slope as best as he can, squatting

551
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,180
 when he can.

552
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:19,940
 But the bramble is scratching him, poking him, cutting him, leaving thin rivers of blood

553
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,660
 dripping out of the wounds across his body.

554
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,660
 He finally gets to the top of the tunnel, bursts out of the clearing, and at this point he's

555
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:34,860
 standing on the top of this sand dune, and he sees an older couple walking down on the

556
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,980
 beach.

557
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:44,060
 Now he feels like this pursuer, the king of the fort, is right behind him.

558
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,940
 He doesn't turn to look.

559
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,460
 He just begins to run down the sand dune, screaming at the top of his lungs, waving his hands,

560
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,340
 looking for any sort of help.

561
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,980
 This is like, you're at the beach, and you'll change viewpoint.

562
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,420
 You're at the beach with your lovely wife, and all of a sudden a bloody eight-year-old

563
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,940
 boy comes bursting out of the bushes, running and probably rolling down a sand dune, screaming

564
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,540
 about something was chasing him.

565
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,180
 What he figured, he goes, "I..."

566
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,500
 The way that I was so scared, the way that everything was going on, he goes, "Realistically,

567
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,740
 I was in the bushes for about five minutes."

568
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,980
 But the whole ordeal felt like it took a half hour.

569
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:36,700
 I know I wasn't in there for a half hour, but that was a level of fear that I hadn't

570
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,500
 ever come across.

571
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:44,420
 You're being pursued by something in an area you're not familiar with.

572
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,500
 Running up the slope, all getting cut up, something like that.

573
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:54,660
 It's the theory of relativity, but your hot hand on the stove, a second feels like a minute.

574
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,820
 Only he's reunited with his parents.

575
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,740
 They are furious.

576
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,140
 Furious.

577
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:11,260
 He'd been missing for almost three hours.

578
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
 He left them.

579
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,660
 Like he always does, he goes off on these little exploring adventures.

580
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,700
 It took him a while to realize that he hadn't come back.

581
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,940
 It's been a little bit longer.

582
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,420
 They're vacationing in this area.

583
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,500
 He doesn't know the environment.

584
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,660
 Once they started looking for him, they began walking up and down the beach, looking for

585
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
 him.

586
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,860
 For over two hours, the search continued until finally they found each other.

587
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,940
 When he told his parents what happened about the bush, about the man, they didn't believe

588
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
 him.

589
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,660
 They 100% thought he was making it up because he knew he was in trouble for being gone so

590
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
 long.

591
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
 He couldn't figure that out.

592
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
 He was only gone for five minutes.

593
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,220
 He knew it wasn't that.

594
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,380
 Well, he knew it definitely wasn't a couple hours.

595
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,140
 He said it felt like 30 minutes.

596
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,820
 I think it was really only five minutes.

597
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,940
 They were telling me I was gone for hours.

598
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,100
 That's not how it happened.

599
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,060
 He goes, "I just don't really know what to make of this whole experience."

600
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,300
 This happened back in 2002.

601
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,140
 He's posting about it 20 years later.

602
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,460
 He goes, "I really just don't know what to think about the whole thing."

603
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
 It happened.

604
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,220
 It was real.

605
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,300
 But what was it?

606
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:27,140
 He goes, "I've even been back to Martha's Vineyard multiple times since."

607
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,140
 Couldn't find the claring.

608
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
 Couldn't find the tunnel.

609
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,540
 Couldn't find him.

610
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,780
 Such an interesting story.

611
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,620
 A lot of people online when they were talking about this trying to tell sweaty, maybe it

612
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,580
 was the Faye.

613
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,580
 Maybe it was this fairy, "I don't like the Faye stuff.

614
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,820
 I just think it's kind of boring."

615
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,820
 The Faye, right?

616
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,420
 They were abducting children.

617
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,100
 They're holding spears and chasing children through the bushes.

618
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
 "I'm all boring.

619
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
 They have a bunch of tight-up kids."

620
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,300
 I was like, "If you guys were abducted by aliens, then I'd save you."

621
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 Faye.

622
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,580
 People are saying maybe it was the Faye.

623
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,100
 I think they're only getting that because those dummies live in bushes too.

624
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,620
 Some people thought they could have actually been humans.

625
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:15,340
 Actual Native Americans still living in the bushes around Martha's Vineyard, which actually

626
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,100
 sounds less plausible than the Faye.

627
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,700
 I did an episode a long time ago.

628
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,420
 I don't remember what episode it was, but I do think there probably is America so big.

629
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,700
 There might be one or two lost tribes in America that we've just never stumbled across.

630
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:36,460
 I actually think I said there might be a lost group of pilgrims somewhere in the middle

631
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,460
 of the United States, like a straight-up little house on the prairie town of maybe like 23

632
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,180
 people or whatever, in the middle of some godforsaken wilderness.

633
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,580
 They were just fine, right?

634
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,300
 But we don't know that they're there.

635
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,780
 There's places in America that have never been explored.

636
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,260
 But Martha's Vineyard, around on the coastline, it's less likely that it would be in a tourist

637
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,980
 destination like Martha's Vineyard.

638
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,540
 But possible right could have been humans.

639
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,820
 But remember, he wasn't describing them as humans.

640
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,820
 They were human alike.

641
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,140
 They were "people."

642
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,980
 Inner-dimensional, maybe?

643
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,500
 Maybe they were people, but it was some sort of time distortion.

644
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,540
 The fact of that, let's say that it was some sort of like he traveled back in time.

645
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:32,940
 The fact that the bushes were kind of like the tunnel was made into the bushes, that,

646
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,180
 even I don't know how to classify this.

647
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,780
 Because if it was a time travel thing, he would have just walked around the corner and

648
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,060
 saw a bunch of Native Americans standing there and they're like, "Hey, what's up?"

649
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,940
 And then they chase it with the spear.

650
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,980
 The fact that it was a tunnel, it was almost like it was leading him down this passageway,

651
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
 right?

652
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,380
 It was almost like a hidden gateway into some place he shouldn't be.

653
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,380
 You're like, "Yeah, Jason, the fairies do that.

654
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,820
 I don't want to talk about fairies, man.

655
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
 I don't think it's fairies."

656
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,540
 And what if there's some sort of nature spirit that has wings and they have little wands

657
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,860
 and stuff like that and they grant wishes?

658
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,860
 Forgive the fairies.

659
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,860
 Forgive the fairies.

660
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 Forgive the fey.

661
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
 Could be.

662
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
 You know, here's the thing.

663
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
 I'll tell you exactly this.

664
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,500
 When I read the story the very first time, I thought, the first thing that popped in my

665
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:29,420
 head was they were real people and it was a cult.

666
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,220
 It was like a myth-risk cult.

667
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:38,340
 It was like this old religion that's been long wiped from the history books, but yet

668
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,540
 people still worship this deity.

669
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,740
 That's what I, that was the feeling I got from it right away.

670
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,020
 Was that they were people.

671
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,860
 Like, the fact that he was having things like a blurry memory, the fact that he didn't actually

672
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,260
 say they were human.

673
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,060
 A lot of that stuff I chalk up to him being eight, right?

674
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,380
 And being terrified.

675
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,380
 I was reading it.

676
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,660
 I was like, let's look at it rationally, right?

677
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,020
 Martha's Vineyard, a bunch of rich people.

678
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:17,260
 The elite, right, who worship these old gods, who follow these pagan ways, are having a

679
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
 retreat in the bush.

680
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,500
 Okay, that sounds kind of dumb too because everyone's like, "Hey, hey, George Soros, where

681
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
 are you going?"

682
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
 He's like, "I got some business in the bush, isn't there?"

683
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,980
 "What are you doing?"

684
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,340
 And then you see this old dude like crawling down.

685
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
 He's crawling down.

686
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
 He's crawling through the ramble here and...

687
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
 Oh, oh, oh.

688
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,340
 People are like, "What?"

689
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
 That's super weird.

690
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,740
 I saw a couple of Rothschilds and a couple of Rockefellers going there.

691
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
 What?

692
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,700
 Why is Jeff Bezos taking his shirt off to go down that slide into that bush?

693
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:52,220
 Okay, so maybe the best place for the elite to meet, to worship an old pagan lord, where

694
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,340
 he is in a bunch of thorn bushes, straight off of a beach at Martha's Vineyard.

695
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:04,100
 And that was the first idea that I had, was that not that I wanted to see Jeff Bezos with

696
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,660
 no shirt on, getting scratched up.

697
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,040
 It was that I thought this was human.

698
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,780
 It was some old cult or old religion but new followers type of thing.

699
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,900
 That was the feeling I got.

700
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:25,820
 But whether it's something cool, like my idea, like my totally awesome idea that it's a cult,

701
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:32,060
 or something lame, like the Faye, the point is that it's creepy.

702
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,820
 Because it touches on all of our fears, right?

703
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,300
 The idea that you can go missing at any point, like he thought, "I'll never be seen again."

704
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,580
 We cover so many stories where people just disappear, missing 4011, that's pretty much

705
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,420
 all they talk about.

706
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,740
 The idea that you, or one of your loved ones, could walk outside and just never be seen

707
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,500
 again is terrifying.

708
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,220
 But it also touches on the fear of the other, right?

709
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,260
 This group holding these secret ceremonies just out of view.

710
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:07,420
 And us normal people who go about our lives, we don't realize that just maybe 500 yards

711
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:15,300
 underneath us, or 60 feet away in the bushes, or maybe in your own attic, maybe in your

712
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,540
 own attic, there are these secret rituals going on.

713
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,940
 There's these gatherings, there are these ceremonies taking place.

714
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,620
 We're just completely oblivious to it.

715
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,860
 It's creepy to think that these things may exist, and that this boy came across one of

716
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,420
 these and probably did just barely escape.

717
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,020
 This story could have easily ended.

718
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,860
 Well, it wouldn't have been a story, right?

719
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,860
 We never would have out here on the West Coast.

720
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,580
 Maybe we would have covered a story about a little boy who went missing back in 2002 at

721
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,860
 Martha's Vineyard, right?

722
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:55,780
 Maybe it could just be one of many missing persons cases that happen, and everyone but

723
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,060
 the family and friends of the victim, just forget about it and move on.

724
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:07,860
 Whether the story is paranormal, conspiracy, or true crime, right?

725
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,700
 It could have been any of those three, or all.

726
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:18,440
 It's still a reminder that as much as we want to believe it, we are not.

727
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,540
 We are not the masters of the domain.

728
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,580
 We are not the rulers of the earth.

729
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,940
 We're simply bystanders, participants.

730
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,240
 We don't make the rules.

731
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,340
 We only follow them.

732
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,660
 That is the way of this world.

733
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:51,520
 Whether we like it or not, you can only hope that if you ever come across a situation where

734
00:40:51,520 --> 00:41:00,040
 you're confronted by a king of the fort, you also can outrun him.

735
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,240
 Whether it's trying to find your way through a tunnel in a clearing of bushes, or booking

736
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:13,520
 it down a dark street as shadowy agents follow your every move.

737
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:21,300
 Whether it's standing at a bus stop late at night, and you can sense eyes staring at you

738
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:28,640
 from the alleyway across the street, or you're simply sleeping in your bed and you have no

739
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:43,220
 knowledge that some dark cult or some malignant entity has chosen you as its next sacrifice.

740
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:48,160
 The only thing you can hope for, the only thing any of us can hope for is that when

741
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,080
 our time comes, when we are put in a situation where we are confronted by this type of oppressor,

742
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,680
 the only thing we can hope for if we're ever put in such a dire circumstance, whether we

743
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,360
 looked for it or not, whether we went exploring in the bushes or in the safety of our own

744
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,200
 home.

745
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:34,380
 We can only hope that we survive to tell the tale.

746
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:59,660
 We can only hope that we survive to tell the tale.

747
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,240
 (upbeat music)
