1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
 An artist in Peoria, Illinois is asked to help beautify the neighborhood.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,140
 Little did he know he was about to paint his way into a mystery.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,620
 And then we travel to Nigeria to cover one of the most brutal cults we have ever covered

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,120
 on this show.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,540
 Is it possible that there is a gang of serial killers in Nigeria that are using black magic

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,500
 to elude the authorities today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:37,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,320
 I'm actually recording this episode right after yesterday's episode because this weekend

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
 I'm gonna house sit.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
 That's what my vacation is.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,720
 I'm gonna go house sit and I'm gonna go wrestle a cat.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,000
 My friend has a kitty cat.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm gonna play with it.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 That's not a euphemism.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's an actual cat.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
 I'm gonna house sit and wrestle around with a cat.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,260
 Now by the time you're listening to this episode, the house sitting adventure will be over.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,060
 I'll be covered in scratch marks.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,020
 But I will have had lots of fun and I'm gonna do a bunch of reading and get a bunch of stuff

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,260
 done for the show.

24
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,060
 Speaking of wrestling, cats here comes one of our legacy Patreons, Greg.

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,660
 Greg, you're gonna get attacked by a bunch of cats.

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
 Oh, he's doing good.

27
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,660
 He's petting them now.

28
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,660
 They're calming down.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,660
 I don't know.

30
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,660
 He could be deadly allergic to cats.

31
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,100
 He may hate cats, well I know, but I do know.

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,700
 Greg, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
 You get to wear the Patreon.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,980
 I totally understand.

35
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,400
 Which helps read the word about the show.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,740
 Really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,560
 Tell your cats and they will tell the other cats in the neighborhood, "Listen to Dead

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
 Rabbit Radio."

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
 They all sound like Betty Boop.

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
 You didn't know that?

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,760
 That's why you don't have a cat.

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,120
 Greg, I'm gonna toss you some coal.

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,360
 For the Carboner Caboose, we are gonna take a little train ride out to Peoria, Illinois.

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,160
 Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga.

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 Choo-choo.

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
 We're all dressed up like cats.

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
 I can't wait, dude.

48
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,520
 It's been so long since I've had some cat time.

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,680
 I'm totally gonna wrestle him.

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,780
 I hope that he just doesn't leave because he's an outdoor cat.

51
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
 I'm gonna be sitting there all alone.

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
 Aw.

53
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,180
 And then he just comes in, eats some food.

54
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,180
 And I'm like, "You wanna play?"

55
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,180
 And he runs away again.

56
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,100
 I'll adopt some raccoons if that's the case.

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,300
 But, friend, I'm gonna get rejected by a cat.

58
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
 Let's not worry about that.

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,020
 Everyone on the train is like, "Dude, what are you talking about?"

60
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
 Just keeping that train going.

62
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,340
 We're headed to Peoria, Illinois.

63
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,300
 It's November 2020.

64
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,020
 So fairly recent story.

65
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,340
 And I wanted to give a shout out to Ratchoo.

66
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,640
 They're the one who pointed out this story to me, so really, really appreciate that.

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
 It's Peoria, Illinois.

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,760
 It's November 2020.

69
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,560
 There's a local artist in town.

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,600
 His name is Joshua Hawkins.

71
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,640
 One day he's sitting there just sketching stuff.

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,320
 I assume artists do nothing but draw all the time.

73
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
 Someone's like, "Hey, it's time for dinner."

74
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
 He's like, "Shh.

75
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
 I'm drawing.

76
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 Shhh."

77
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
 Gets a phone call.

78
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,000
 He draws himself a phone, answers it.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
 Apparently he lives in Toontown.

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
 Joshua Hawkins, what do you need?

81
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,640
 It's a local businessman named Nate.

82
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
 He's like, "Hey, listen.

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
 My name's Nate.

84
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,460
 I'm building in town and has just this brick wall, which I don't have a problem with bricks.

85
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,860
 I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd, but I feel like it could be a little more beautified."

86
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,860
 You know what I mean?

87
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
 You know what I mean?

88
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,820
 So I would like to commission you to do some work.

89
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,220
 I'd like you to paint the side of my building.

90
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,500
 Joshua's like, "That's cool."

91
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,780
 Now, Nate, we don't know the exact amount, but according to Joshua, he was offered the

92
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,980
 biggest commission he's ever been offered as an artist.

93
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,020
 He goes, "This is more money than I've ever been paid for artist."

94
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,400
 It was actually so much money, I was able to hire a crew to get this job done quickly.

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,920
 But Nate goes, "Tell you what, I'll pay you 50% upfront.

96
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,880
 I'll pay you 50% when it's done, and I'm going to provide all the paint.

97
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,240
 I will buy all the paint for you."

98
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,640
 Joshua's like, "Oh, this is a dream come true."

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
 He's given a design of what the side of the building is going to look like.

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,760
 So Joshua didn't have totally free reign.

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,240
 He's given a sketch.

102
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,760
 So this is a massive building.

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
 It's not maybe a one-story building, but still, that's pretty big.

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 That's what like 10, 12 feet.

105
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,880
 So it's this giant mural, and it's a picture of the skyline of Peoria, Illinois.

106
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,380
 And then standing over the skyline like Godzilla is Cookie Monster from Sesame Street.

107
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,980
 Me want cookie.

108
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,380
 And he's holding a cookie and it's shooting a rainbow out across the city.

109
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,940
 And then underneath in acrylic in Russian, it says "Peace Earth Cookies."

110
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,760
 Which is a play on an old linen poster, "Peace Land and Bread."

111
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 So Peace Earth Cookies.

112
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
 It's just a giant sketch of Cookie Monster.

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,680
 And it's in like a Soviet style.

114
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
 Looks like a Soviet propaganda.

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
 So Joshua's like, "Oh, this looks totally dope actually.

116
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,280
 This looks like a really cool design.

117
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,160
 It seems like it'd be really fun."

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
 It's a conversation piece of the very least.

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 He hires a crew.

120
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
 They go out there.

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 They paint it.

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,760
 And you got to worry about stuff when you're doing art like this out in public.

123
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,460
 They actually coat it in an anti-graffiti coating.

124
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,680
 So some jerk can't come up and just go "Cookie suck!" and spray on it.

125
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,400
 It's built to stand the test of time.

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
 It's really as a work of art.

127
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,520
 If they get it done for Thanksgiving, I can just imagine Joshua and his crew are standing

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,000
 back and they're looking at this mural and they're just like, "Freeze frame, credits

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,080
 start rolling, it's the end of an adventure."

130
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,640
 They drew something that was going to be the talk of the town for years to come.

131
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,600
 Well, it was the talk of the town a couple days later when Nate came back from Thanksgiving.

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,780
 Nate Comte is the owner of the building.

133
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,220
 And he 100% did not authorize this painting to be done.

134
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,860
 He was away visiting family members.

135
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,560
 And someone impersonated him and got someone to draw a 12 foot tall Cookie Monster Soviet

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,180
 painting on the side of Nate's building.

137
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,740
 Nate Comte, the actual owner of the building, was furious.

138
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,980
 I could just imagine him.

139
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
 Here's the sequel to the movie.

140
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
 He gets out of the cab.

141
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,420
 He's like, "Ah, sweet Peoria air."

142
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,420
 And then he's just like, "I'm going to slowly turn around and look at that building I own."

143
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,540
 He's holding his two suitcases, turns around, drops the suitcases, frees frame.

144
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,540
 You wonder how he got here.

145
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
 Well, we know how you got here.

146
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,280
 Nate, you got scammed.

147
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
 Somebody pretended to be him committed identity theft to someone paying a giant Cookie Monster

148
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
 on his building.

149
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,620
 First he was going to have Joshua charged with vandalism, but he dropped that.

150
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,380
 He goes, "Listen, I don't blame you because someone impersonated me, but I'm painting over

151
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
 it."

152
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,060
 And people got really upset about it because it had already been there for a couple of

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,060
 days.

154
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,340
 It was the talk of the town.

155
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
 He paints over it.

156
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,700
 He paints over it white.

157
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,940
 And he's looking for Nate.

158
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
 Now it's like another movie.

159
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,460
 Now it's like face off.

160
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,960
 Nate versus Nate.

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
 He's looking for him.

162
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
 But he painted it over white.

163
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,460
 He actually, and people got really mad at him.

164
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,900
 And he goes, "Listen, I'm not the villain.

165
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
 This was my building.

166
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,140
 I don't want a giant Cookie Monster on it."

167
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,140
 But tell you what.

168
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,140
 I'm going to hold a poll.

169
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
 So you know where this is going.

170
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,580
 I'm going to hold a poll and the community can vote on what mural they want up on my

171
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
 building.

172
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,440
 Of course, the number one people were voting for was giant Soviet Cookie Monster.

173
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,540
 So he removed that and somewhat submitted a sketch of how they have those Japanese paintings,

174
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,660
 those beautiful Japanese paintings of the waves.

175
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,180
 They did that, but it was Cookie Monster as a wave and a bunch of cookies flying in his

176
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
 mouth.

177
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,660
 So I'll put those in the show notes.

178
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,900
 You really should look at the other options.

179
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
 He's like, "No."

180
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
 He's like, "Nyet."

181
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
 None of that.

182
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,460
 I don't want a Cookie Monster on my building.

183
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,940
 It'd be hilarious if it was a cookie store.

184
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
 It's not.

185
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,100
 It's just a building.

186
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,860
 I don't even know what it's being used for.

187
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:25,980
 Then to add another weird crinkle in it, a Twitter account @artterrorism has come forward

188
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,700
 and said they haven't declared themselves as Nate.

189
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,020
 And as the time of this recording, there's only like 89 followers for this account.

190
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,300
 It's pretty new.

191
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,420
 They haven't announced themselves at Nate, but they said, "Here's the original sketch

192
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,700
 and I'm auctioning it off."

193
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,300
 And we'll give the money to like, I think it was St. Jude's charity and then the other

194
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,500
 half went to like an artist's collective or something like that.

195
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,820
 It was a Bitcoin only auction.

196
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,460
 Everything was super anonymous, but they were auctioning it off.

197
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,460
 And they did.

198
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,100
 They sold it and the guys like, "Here's a bunch of money headed to St. Jude's."

199
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,980
 A wholesome conspiracy, a mystery that doesn't involve any sort of murder or catastrophe.

200
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,580
 I mean, unless you hate cookie monster, it's just the story of a man impersonating another

201
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,460
 man to get a third man to paint on the second man's building.

202
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,980
 So it still is a bizarre mystery.

203
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,580
 No one knows who this is.

204
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,740
 No one knows if more pranks are going to pop up, but there was one that actually preceded

205
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
 this.

206
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,700
 A politician who died in 2013 and at Nate Comte's business, this was before Cookie Monster,

207
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,340
 someone keeps putting up campaign signs for this dead politician.

208
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,900
 And that was irritating Nate enough.

209
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,700
 There was actually an early article and he's like, "Yeah, I don't know who's doing this,

210
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,060
 but it's a mystery."

211
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,020
 And then a couple months later, John Cookie Monster shows up.

212
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,700
 So someone might be targeting him specifically.

213
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
 Someone may just like that plot of land.

214
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,920
 We won't know until the identity of Nate is revealed.

215
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,100
 Some people are calling him the Midwest Banksy.

216
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,740
 He's a little self-indulgent.

217
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
 He's calling himself that.

218
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,820
 He's like, "Hey, I got a scoop for you, editor.

219
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,540
 I'm a new reporter and he has a big fake mustache, the big blue furry fake mustache."

220
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,140
 Greg, let's go ahead and leave behind Peoria, Illinois and leave behind that whole mystery

221
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,100
 because we're headed out to someplace far, far crazier.

222
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,900
 I wanted to highlight kind of a goofy conspiracy to start us off because where we're headed

223
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,140
 is someplace brutal.

224
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,400
 This next story is going to be really brutal.

225
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,080
 So call in that carpenter, Greg.

226
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
 We're all climbing on board.

227
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,280
 We're giving Cookie Monster a good old pet, eating some cookies.

228
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,080
 We're headed out to Nigeria.

229
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,600
 As we're out there, I wanted to give you guys a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

230
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 I've actually been...

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 Who is it?

232
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
 Yeah, what's up?

233
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 Yeah?

234
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 Yeah, man, totally.

235
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,540
 I'm actually going to be leaving pretty soon, so that works for me.

236
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,060
 I'm going to put a note.

237
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
 Okay.

238
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,260
 I need to absolutely get up and start washing my hands.

239
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
 Thanks.

240
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,420
 Okay, had to take a little break there.

241
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,960
 I was making some repairs, so we're a couple hours later.

242
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,120
 The reason why I'm saying that is, one, the audio quality may change.

243
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,840
 Secondly, in that interim, I ate Thai food.

244
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 There's nothing new with the podcast.

245
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,240
 This is episode 600.

246
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,640
 I didn't realize that until I was moving some files around.

247
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
 Six...

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,240
 You know how many episodes of The Simpsons there are?

249
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
 639, man.

250
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
 We've almost got up to The Simpsons.

251
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,840
 We'll be caught up to The Simpsons by the end of the season.

252
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,900
 And guys, the show would not exist without you, so these 600 episodes aren't mine.

253
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 They're ours.

254
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,300
 Really, really appreciate your support.

255
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 But we left off.

256
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,540
 I was about to mention a Dead Rabbit recommends as Greg is flying the Carpenter Cofter off

257
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,540
 to Nigeria.

258
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,500
 This is a nice little pallet cleanser.

259
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,220
 The story we're about to cover is super dark.

260
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,620
 Just to prepare you guys, it might be the most brutal cult we've ever covered.

261
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,740
 I would say it absolutely is the most brutal cult we've ever covered, but before we get

262
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
 there...

263
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,280
 Let's talk about a movie called Come Play.

264
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
 It's the movie...

265
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,680
 You know, I saw the trailer for it.

266
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
 It looked really, really cheesy.

267
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
 It looked...

268
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,840
 And it is like a straight to DVD movie or straight to streaming movie, but it is excellent.

269
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 It's called Come Play.

270
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,560
 It's about a young autistic boy who's severely autistic.

271
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
 He can't talk.

272
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
 He communicates through a tablet.

273
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,060
 So he can make noises.

274
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,000
 But he has this tablet that he's always...

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,700
 So he's like, "I want water!"

276
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,220
 He's not saying that the tablet is.

277
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
 So he has these little symbols.

278
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,220
 But he's trying to go to school.

279
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,580
 He's trying to be a boy in society.

280
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,260
 Gets picked on a lot and stuff like that.

281
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,180
 And then the tablet, a spooky book appears on the tablet one day called The Tale of Freddy,

282
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,700
 the Friendless Fiend or something like that.

283
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,460
 And as you read the pages of the book on the tablet, Freddy the Fiend...

284
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,780
 That's not a sexual name, but Freddy the Fiend is one step closer to coming into the

285
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
 real world.

286
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,160
 And basically the Babadook, but far superior.

287
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
 Babadook had style going forward, but really didn't have substance.

288
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
 This movie has both.

289
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,000
 And this movie has one of the things I really like with modern horror movies.

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
 They're forgetting the jump scares.

291
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,080
 We're moving away from jump scares.

292
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,560
 They have what I call action set pieces or horror set pieces.

293
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,800
 There's maybe five or six pieces, set pieces in this movie, that if you removed from them

294
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,740
 and released it as a short film, it would be totally effective.

295
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,740
 The one criticism I'm going to give it is they give the autistic boy a nickname, a very,

296
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,940
 very cruel nickname, and they do it so early in the movie and they call him this nickname

297
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
 throughout the movie.

298
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,780
 I don't even remember the character's name.

299
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,260
 I just know him as Monor Boner.

300
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,180
 Because the whole movie, there's this bully who's one of the best actors in the movie

301
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,580
 and he looks like he's seen some stuff.

302
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,820
 He does a really good job.

303
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,400
 He actually looks like he could be, he could have been in Dunkirk, just that look in his

304
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 eyes.

305
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,560
 But he calls this kid Monor Boner the whole time because all he does is moan.

306
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,000
 And by the end of the movie I was like, "Monor Boner, no!

307
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Run!

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
 Look how Freddy's right behind you!"

309
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,040
 I don't remember the guy's name.

310
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,080
 I just remember him as Monor Boner.

311
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:27,160
 So a tip to you budding writers out there, don't come up with a funny nickname and use

312
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,400
 it all the time.

313
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 Don't do that.

314
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,900
 Because now just forever remember him as Monor Boner.

315
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,360
 The movies come play, the trailer is in the show notes, the trailer doesn't really give

316
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,480
 anything away, the plot's pretty thin, but it is a great, fun, horror movie, Dead Rabbit

317
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
 recommends come play.

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,860
 Greg, you are now bringing us past the Blockbuster section of the world, it's just the last remaining

319
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,180
 Blockbuster video, and we are entering Nigerian airspace.

320
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:04,280
 It's a dark night, it's one in the morning, and a man is driving his SUV down the road,

321
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,800
 he gets a flat tire.

322
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,160
 That's gonna suck anywhere, but where he's getting the flat tire and the time period

323
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,840
 he's getting the flat tire is gonna make things even worse.

324
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,560
 This man's name is Paul Chinneydo.

325
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,200
 He's a comedian, he's a local comedian, he goes by the name MC Think Twice, but he has

326
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 a flat tire now.

327
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,540
 He sees another car come and he flags him down, he's like, "Guys, listen can you help me,

328
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,020
 I got a flat tire," and they're like, "Hey, aren't you MC Think Twice?"

329
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,780
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I am that man, I'm so glad that you recognize me."

330
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,580
 Tires flack, can you guys help me fix this tire?

331
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,500
 So as they're trying to fix this tire late at night on the outskirts of this small town

332
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,580
 in Nigeria, they begin to see other cars approaching them.

333
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,140
 Let's go back a year.

334
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:56,720
 It's 2016 and in Nigeria, a serial killer is loose, but not only a serial killer, this

335
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,560
 man is terrorizing entire towns.

336
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:09,520
 In Ikoridu, Nigeria, you have multiple families wiped out.

337
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:18,760
 A man will break into a house, completely unseen, smash the heads open of anybody there.

338
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,300
 So rape the women and then write, "I am Ba-Doo" on the door before he leaves.

339
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,260
 In the year 2016, multiple murders happen exactly this way.

340
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,780
 When the police show up, they can tell that the blood of the victims seems to be smeared

341
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,500
 around with a handkerchief of some sort.

342
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,140
 Which makes them think there is a ritual involved in this.

343
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,980
 If their head is bashed in, they can see the telltale signs of a handkerchief being run

344
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,340
 through the blood.

345
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,600
 If the victim is raped, the handkerchief is used to soak up the blood from the genitals

346
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,640
 as well.

347
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,680
 The police cannot find this serial killer.

348
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,200
 Until June 5th, 2016, they arrest the man.

349
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,820
 He had just raped and murdered a 27 year old woman next to her 9-month old child.

350
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,140
 And then killed the child as well.

351
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,220
 When the police arrest this man, they ask, "Who are you?"

352
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,740
 He responds, "I am Ba-Doo."

353
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,460
 Then things get a hundred times worse.

354
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,200
 The murders escalate by astronomical numbers.

355
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,240
 They spill out of the city of Aikorudu and envelop entire swaths of Nigeria.

356
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,360
 It wasn't a serial killer, it was a group, known as the Ba-Doo Boys.

357
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,800
 Saying modus operandi, completely random, they break into your house and they take a

358
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,280
 stone rod, this stone handle that you use to crush the grain.

359
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,980
 That's their weapon of choice.

360
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,660
 Which makes sense because a lot of houses have these things in them.

361
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,060
 But that is the weapon they use.

362
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,460
 They break into a house completely unheard and use these grinding stones to bash people's

363
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,940
 heads open.

364
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,140
 They will walk into a house with five people and slaughter them all in their sleep.

365
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,940
 People begin gathering in churches, sleeping in churches where they would be safe.

366
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,520
 They would break into the church, rape and murder and annihilate.

367
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
 Nothing could stop these guys.

368
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,440
 Of course the people begin to believe that they must have some sort of mystical powers.

369
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,920
 They're obviously performing some sort of ritual with the handkerchiefs.

370
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,960
 But you can't catch them.

371
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,520
 It took so long just to catch the one guy who they thought was Ba-Doo.

372
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,600
 But he turns out he was just a member of this group.

373
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,380
 That night they scaled a wall of a church, broke into it.

374
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,900
 In the church were two women and their children.

375
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,080
 They murdered the two women, murdered the two children, swept up their blood with the handkerchief,

376
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,060
 broke into another church down the road and stole people's money and phones.

377
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,980
 Talk about survivor's guilt on that one.

378
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
 Right?

379
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,460
 Like, could you imagine surviving in the other church?

380
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,200
 You'd be grateful that that's all that happened, but you would know that it could have easily

381
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
 been reversed.

382
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,320
 Between June 16th and September 2019, this is still an active group.

383
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,020
 I was looking at a report created by the Justice Department where they had to- this is such

384
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,240
 a big issue in Nigeria that it's an international issue.

385
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,940
 Nigeria has actually tried using their troops to flush these guys out.

386
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,340
 The United States Justice Department actually had to create this huge report and they reported

387
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:07,220
 between June 2016 and September 2019 there was 19 attacks by the Ba-Doo boys.

388
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
 You go 19 attacks?

389
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,380
 It's not- I mean that's horrible that they've broken to 19 homes.

390
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,860
 Those 19 attacks added up to 47 murders.

391
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,960
 Some houses they would break in just murder one person.

392
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,120
 I saw several reports of families of five or more all slaughtered in one night.

393
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,240
 Completely random.

394
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,760
 They're still out there.

395
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:37,240
 They're doing these huge dragnets, but nobody's actually getting charged with these murders.

396
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,840
 No matter how many people they seem to scoop up, the Ba-Doo boys themselves are getting

397
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,000
 away scot-free.

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,280
 So we know where this story's going.

399
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,820
 It really branches off into two directions.

400
00:19:50,820 --> 00:20:00,180
 One, you have people believing that the politicians and the chief of police are in on the killings.

401
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,460
 That the people who are sworn to protect them are actually part of the serial killer conspiracy.

402
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,260
 Very very interesting conspiracy theory.

403
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,980
 That's where- we still have those conspiracy theories today.

404
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,460
 The Queen of England's a reptilian.

405
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,560
 You have members of the government involved in all sorts of creepy disgusting stuff.

406
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,520
 I think every population has their own conspiracy theory about their government.

407
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,040
 So that doesn't seem odd.

408
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,440
 They're like "well if you can't catch them you must be part of the problem."

409
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,960
 But there are other people who aren't content in just making up conspiracy theories.

410
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,960
 These Ba-Doo boys are slaughtering families at random and they've been doing it unchecked

411
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,160
 for three years.

412
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,180
 That's when the vigilante-ism begins.

413
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,380
 Paul Chinidu is a comedian.

414
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,300
 His stage name was MC Think Twice.

415
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:57,940
 His car broke down on the way home from a gig and he was able to flag down another car

416
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,420
 to help him repair his tire.

417
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,820
 But while they were waiting some vigilantes showed up.

418
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,340
 Now Paul isn't a member of the Ba-Doo boys.

419
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,340
 The two people who stopped to help him most likely weren't members of the Ba-Doo boys.

420
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,160
 But the vigilantes were wondering why these three people were out in the middle of nowhere

421
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,880
 at one in the morning.

422
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,800
 Even though they could point to the fact "look at there's a flat tire, these guys just happen

423
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,160
 to be driving by and needed their help."

424
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,560
 Fear had overtaken Nigeria to such a point that these three men were killed on the spot

425
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,400
 and then their bodies were burned.

426
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,560
 Within one month vigilantes had killed ten innocent people.

427
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,900
 They thought they were guilty, but after they were killed they were most likely not members

428
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,580
 of the Ba-Doo boys.

429
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,340
 Within one month ten innocent people were killed in the search for this gang and a gang that

430
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,740
 is so tied up in chaos magic.

431
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,980
 Music to their ears.

432
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,540
 So the government's response to all of this tells its citizens "well first off you should

433
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,840
 always carry your state ID card on you."

434
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,500
 That was honestly a statement made to the press.

435
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,240
 We cannot control the madness.

436
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,840
 You can be killed in your own home by the Ba-Doo boys or you can be killed on the streets

437
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,120
 by a vigilante group.

438
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,360
 Now we can't control what either of those groups do so carry your ID on you at all

439
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,680
 time.

440
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,120
 So if the vigilantes show up you can prove you are who you say you are.

441
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,860
 I mean the Ba-Doo boys would have state ID too right?

442
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,900
 But that was one of the things the government was using to try to at least stop the vigilante

443
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
ism.

444
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
 And they are against that.

445
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,060
 They're like you just can't go around killing people.

446
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,220
 Another thing that was really interesting I was reading this report, this news article

447
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,060
 they said "the police need to go beyond conventional tactics to deal with this."

448
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,300
 Now in Nigeria they have a big problem obviously with the Ba-Doo boys.

449
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,700
 They've been in operation for three years.

450
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,800
 They also have people who will siphon gas out of gas lines.

451
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,560
 That's been an issue in Mexico recently as well.

452
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,600
 Where you siphon gas out of gas lines you sell on the black market.

453
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,080
 Where they will have to use troops.

454
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,000
 They'll have to use aircraft to go after these guys.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Helicopters.

456
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 They'll move troops into the areas.

457
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,080
 They'll have shootouts all over the outskirts trying to stop these gas thieves.

458
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,560
 And then you also have the Ba-Doo boys running around but the Ba-Doo boys aren't so obvious

459
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,360
 where they're making a militarized stand somewhere.

460
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,700
 But one thing that they do which again points to their ritual nature and we'll get more

461
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,860
 into that in a second but you'll find shrines.

462
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,820
 You may make a wrong turn in your town.

463
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,300
 Walk down an abandoned street and you see in the corner a shrine for the Ba-Doo boys.

464
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 It may be outside of town.

465
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,740
 Maybe in the wilderness.

466
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
 Hidden.

467
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,740
 A place where the Ba-Doo boys have their shrine.

468
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,520
 The shrines get destroyed when they see them but they can't find the members themselves.

469
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,660
 Any other thing that you would think this was all made up you would go it's like a boogeyman.

470
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,080
 We've never found a dead shape shifting reptilian.

471
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,100
 So when people talk about shape shifting reptilians most people just kind of roll their eyes because

472
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,200
 it's like a boogeyman.

473
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,320
 But these guys are actively committing these crimes.

474
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,960
 It's not something that people are like oh no my penis is gone it must be the Ba-Doo

475
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
 boys.

476
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,500
 These guys actually have a criminal record.

477
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,460
 These murders are taking place and we know why they're taking place.

478
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,340
 So it's not like someone stumbling across weird sticks bound together like the Blair

479
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,140
 Witch and going it must be the Ba-Doo boys.

480
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,340
 They know the crimes are taking place.

481
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,420
 They know the organization exists.

482
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,840
 Governments are trying to stop them and they're finding these shrines.

483
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,380
 So you have all of this evidence set up.

484
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,400
 It's not a weird conspiracy these people exist.

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,220
 One of these groups is actually murdering people but people are also giving them occult

486
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
 powers.

487
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,060
 They're saying they can't be stopped.

488
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,960
 They can appear into your house.

489
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
 They can control you.

490
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,200
 They have mind control.

491
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,420
 That's how they're able to kill everyone in the family.

492
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,000
 No one's fighting back.

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,080
 Apparently there was a witness.

494
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,820
 There was a young boy who was there.

495
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,160
 His grandmother was killed and he was blinded.

496
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,680
 That was actually one of the early early attacks back in 2016.

497
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,360
 His grandmother's head was smashed open.

498
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
 He was 10 years old.

499
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 He was blinded.

500
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,280
 But he described the salient as being a naked man who came in.

501
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,340
 So that even adds a more savage and scary element to it.

502
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,940
 So we can assume that guy might have just not worn his clothes that day but that may

503
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,540
 be a thing.

504
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
 Maybe part of the ritual.

505
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,260
 But I keep talking about the ritual.

506
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,620
 Whether or not they have magical powers.

507
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,620
 We are a paranormal show so we sometimes give a little bit of more credence to the fact

508
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,700
 that they have magical powers.

509
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,420
 But that's the theory in Nigeria.

510
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,780
 They do have the ability to enter and exit undetected.

511
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,340
 There's no barrier that can stop them.

512
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,900
 They can control your mind.

513
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,520
 There's no way around these guys.

514
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,160
 When they target your family it's done.

515
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,640
 Now we've covered cults before.

516
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,760
 Just recently we covered the cult in Kirtland to Ohio.

517
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
 Talking about the apocalypse.

518
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,400
 The ant hill gang.

519
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,120
 They talk about the apocalypse.

520
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,000
 We've covered and then the famous ones like Jonestown and all that stuff.

521
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,560
 They're always talking about the apocalypse.

522
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,240
 What are these guys end game?

523
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,480
 They've killed 47 people in 3 years and that is the people they kill in the houses.

524
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,080
 They do find bodies every so often in the wilderness and they think this could be a

525
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,580
 bad ooboy slaughter.

526
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,220
 But as far as they can tell 47 murders in 3 years.

527
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
 Why are they doing this?

528
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,860
 Is it to summon some sort of evil god?

529
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,500
 Is it because they worship death?

530
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,340
 It is the main reason why anyone does anything.

531
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,740
 Greed.

532
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,500
 See what they do is they smash your head open or rape you.

533
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:49,120
 And then they use this white handkerchief to soak up the blood from the violence.

534
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,360
 It has to be the head and the genitals.

535
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
 If you just stab the arm off that doesn't work.

536
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 It has to be from the brain and the head or the genital area after it's been damaged.

537
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,240
 They then sell that rag for $2000.

538
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,760
 So what did they make?

539
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
 So let's ground it up to 50 people.

540
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,880
 Let's just say 50 people.

541
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,080
 So what would that be?

542
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,300
 That would be they would have made.

543
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,900
 That turns out I've had a break out of calculating for that one.

544
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
 It turns out to be $100,000 over the course of 3 years.

545
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,460
 The average wage in Nigeria actually isn't that terrible.

546
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,380
 It comes out the average monthly wage is about $850 a month.

547
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,020
 That actually is a lot of money to me.

548
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
 But I'm poor.

549
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,580
 I'm always poor.

550
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,300
 So that might be super low to you.

551
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,580
 But anyways regardless of how much the normal amount is for someone in Nigeria $100,000 doesn't

552
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:46,680
 seem like a ton of money when it involves slaughtering 47 people.

553
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,200
 And sure you could probably add a little bit more.

554
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,040
 I'm not going to go into the math.

555
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,360
 But the point is that that's what the inspiration behind these crimes are.

556
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 It's just money.

557
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,840
 They're using these rags and they're selling them.

558
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,560
 But then the question goes who are they selling them to?

559
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,040
 And this brings us back around to how these guys aren't getting caught.

560
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,540
 A rag soaked in the blood of a murder victim is sold to wizards, local wizards, who use

561
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:19,100
 them to cast spells for fortune and power.

562
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:27,980
 So if the people using those spells are rich and powerful, heads of state, politicians,

563
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,180
 heads of the police department, they got there because of black magic, are they going to

564
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,760
 go all out to find the source of the magic that keeps them in power?

565
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,800
 That's what the people of Nigeria are arguing.

566
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,760
 You're in power because you have access to this magic.

567
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,800
 So you're not going to stop the bad-oo boys.

568
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 You want them to continue so you can continue your reign at the top.

569
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,000
 Now I'm not accusing the politicians of Nigeria that are the head of police or anything like

570
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 that.

571
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,920
 But that is the thought process over there.

572
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,380
 They're powerful because these guys did this so you're not going to stop them so you can

573
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,020
 keep being powerful.

574
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,620
 This is one of those stories where I found that government document saying this is what's

575
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,620
 happening and that goes up to late 2019, early 2020s when that document ends.

576
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,140
 Then you can find articles about the bad-oo boys.

577
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,540
 The year things really spiked, which was 2017.

578
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,460
 2016, 2017 was the worst year for that.

579
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,780
 There's not a lot of articles written about them nowadays.

580
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,680
 But the government is still very, very cautious.

581
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,600
 They haven't written these guys off yet.

582
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,800
 I've talked about this on the show, the most frightening conclusion.

583
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,760
 When I was a kid, not me being a kid is a frightening conclusion.

584
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,840
 When I was a kid, big Marvel comic fan, and one of my hands down, my favorite comic crossover

585
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,640
 series.

586
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,800
 Forget Secret War, forget Age of Ultron, Civil War.

587
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,740
 It was a series of comic books called Axe of Vengeance.

588
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,400
 The supervillains get together and decide, wait a second, what if Doctor Doom fought

589
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,080
 Ghost Rider?

590
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,860
 What if Electro fought Daredevil?

591
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,140
 The villains all decide to fight random superheroes that they've never fought before to keep

592
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
 them off their toes.

593
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,740
 It's a really, really good series.

594
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,300
 It'll never be translated into film because you needed 100 villains to do this.

595
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,600
 The Doctor Strange fought Hobgoblin, Spider-Man fought Magneto, who's really a great crossover

596
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,560
 series and that always has stuck in my head.

597
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,080
 Axe of Vengeance.

598
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,400
 This group is in this area.

599
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,920
 They have a modus operandi, they break into the house, they slaughter people, they use

600
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,840
 the exact same weapon, they use the rag, they smear up the blood, they sell the rag, they

601
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,320
 do it again.

602
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,560
 But in this country, everyone knows the tricks.

603
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,460
 The police know what to look for.

604
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,920
 You have vigilantes and in the military trying to hunt these guys down.

605
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,400
 Do you stop making money?

606
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,040
 Do you keep doing it in that area and hope you don't get caught in the ever shrinking

607
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
 net?

608
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,960
 Or do you pack up and move?

609
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,540
 Because the London police don't know about this.

610
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,300
 The Australian police don't know about this.

611
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,180
 The police in Albuquerque don't know about this.

612
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,280
 And even though there's a Justice Department article out there talking about this, I have

613
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,980
 to find it.

614
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:38,460
 And not every cop can read every document that's ever printed about every crime.

615
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,200
 You move to an area where they don't know the modus operandi.

616
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,480
 You have Skid Row, where over the course of a year, eight homeless people get their head

617
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,360
 bashed in.

618
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,860
 The cops are going to be looking for a serial killer if they even notice them missing it

619
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
 all.

620
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,300
 In New York, one hot summer, a couple prostitutes go missing.

621
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,540
 In Perth, Australia, they find the body of a hiker.

622
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,200
 They think he had an unfortunate accident at the bottom of a cliff.

623
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,140
 In London, they pull a body out of the Times River.

624
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,740
 Then another one.

625
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,180
 Couple months later, another one.

626
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,720
 Serial killers have a geographical area they operate in.

627
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,400
 We know that, and that's part of their modus operandi.

628
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,960
 You can look for that area because that's their area of comfort.

629
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,960
 But the serial killers who are truck drivers, who are crossing the country, that's their

630
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,200
 area of comfort.

631
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
 The entire country.

632
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
 That's why they're so hard to kill.

633
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,000
 If it's not a guy who owns a print shop during the day and he kills co-eds at night, the

634
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,720
 whole world is his stalking grounds.

635
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,900
 And if you're a serial killer and a serial rapist whose organizational goals is to make

636
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,260
 money, the world is your stalking ground.

637
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,580
 If you thought these guys were hard to catch when they were allegedly in bed with local

638
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,740
 government, imagine how hard they would be to catch when they are selling their wares

639
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,420
 to global leaders.

640
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,780
 Gaining power is hard.

641
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,220
 Holding onto that power is near impossible.

642
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,860
 There's just too many other people trying to knock you off the throne.

643
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,700
 And you will do whatever it takes to have an edge in holding onto that power.

644
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,700
 Even if that edge results in other people suffering.

645
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,420
 It is the nature of power.

646
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,180
 So have the badoo boys closed up shop in Nigeria?

647
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,740
 Have they reduced their kill output?

648
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,620
 All of them have been arrested but nobody knows that those were badoo boys?

649
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,940
 Have they suffered at the hands of intergroup warfare?

650
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,780
 Have they just died off?

651
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,300
 Or are they no longer so active in Nigeria because they have gone global?

652
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,360
 A true international trade at this point.

653
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,260
 We can only hope that the story of the badoo boys is over.

654
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,020
 And that my idea that they have gone global is just a scary story.

655
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,200
 But either way, make sure you lock your doors extra tight tonight.

656
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,380
 There may be a group out there who will stop at nothing to make some money.

657
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,820
 Even if it means killing you and everyone you love.

658
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,580
