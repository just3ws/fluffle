1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 A horrific disaster turns into family fun for everyone, and then we travel back to the

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,840
 world of folk tales, where we tell the story of a little blind boy and a talking bird.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,040
 I hadn't heard of it either.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,000
 Well we'll look at both of those today on the episode where I have to have done in 30

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 minutes, Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,680
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,120
 If you listened to yesterday's episode, you know that I'm waiting for a shuttle to take

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,800
 me to the airport.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
 The shuttle arrives at 7.30.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It's 6.30 now.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,440
 I still gotta put my clothes on, but everything's packed up.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,000
 Now when I say I have to have this episode done in a half hour, technically that's correct,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 but I don't want you to think it's a rushed episode.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I had all these stories pre-planned out.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's not like I'm just scrolling through my bookmarks going, "Oh, there's one!

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,480
 That one looks funny!"

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,440
 But let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,320
 So you know, it's funny because when you look at the conspiracy iceberg, there's a ton of

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,960
 stuff on there.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,400
 And you see these and you're like, "Oh, wow, that looks interesting.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
 English travel.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
 Oh, that looks interesting.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,960
 Medieval found footage."

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,760
 One of them was something called the Legend of Kalos Pit, or Kalos Pit.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,360
 This was actually on the conspiracy iceberg.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,800
 I was like, "Oh, I'll look that up."

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,080
 The Treasure of Kalopit is actually what it was called.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,480
 I look it up and I immediately regret it spending just five minutes even looking at it because

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,520
 it is an old folktale about these two dudes in Britain and there's this bog.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
 And you're like, "Jason, if you didn't want reading it, why are you reading it to us?

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
 Okay, I'll skip to the ending."

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,240
 Two dudes are in Britain, there's a bog, there's a bunch of water in it and a bunch of gross

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 stuff.

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,160
 One day the bog is a little bit lower, so they said, "Hey, let's pull a treasure out of

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
 there."

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,360
 Okay, I don't know why they thought there's treasure down there.

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,080
 They stick a hook down there, they reach in, they grab a treasure chest, they pull the hook

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,840
 up, they pull the treasure chest up, and they get it and they go, "Not even old Nick can

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 get it from us now."

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
 It sounds like a weird thing to say.

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,680
 Did they say that all the time?

45
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,520
 Like they're at Dairy Queen the Order of Sunday, they had handed it, "Not even old Nick can

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
 get this now."

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 But anyways, they say that and then the devil comes out of the pit, grabs the box of gold

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,120
 or whatever is in it, yanks it back down, the little hook thingy, not the hook thingy,

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,600
 the little, what's that thing called, the little ring on the treasure chest that you

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,040
 like, you lift it by, handle, I guess was the word I was thinking before.

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,280
 The handle breaks off and then that handle was used as the knocker on the church door.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
 The end.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
 Why is that on the conspiracy iceberg?

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,800
 That more than anything made me a little like, "Uh, maybe this iceberg's not good.

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,440
 Maybe this is just a bad thing altogether."

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,760
 But it's on the iceberg, I wanted to get that out there.

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,320
 But from finding the Callous Pit, I found a website that was nothing but Folk Stories.

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,080
 Now I really liked my "Taylee Poe" episode about Folk Stories.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
 I know I actually said I was going to do this story second, but I've already started doing

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
 it.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,680
 And while I was looking for Callous Pit and being disappointed, I found a website of Folk

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,960
 Stories and some of them are flat out bizarre, which makes sense because they're Folk Stories,

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,680
 they're passed around, people are making stuff up all the time.

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,240
 They're kind of trying to teach a lesson more than anything.

65
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,120
 But I found this story and I was like, "What the hell is going on in this story?"

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,680
 I was constantly being shocked by just how ridiculous it could get.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
 I was just constantly being like, "What is going on in this story?

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,320
 This is the story."

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
 I had never heard of it before.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,320
 I don't think anyone's ever heard of it before, but I could be wrong on that because halfway

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,480
 through the story, I realized they were in a totally different location than where I thought

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 they were originally at.

73
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,960
 And you'll see what I mean.

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,480
 This is the story of the blind boy and the loon.

75
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,160
 Like a bird loon, not like a lunatic running through the woods capturing children and blinding

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 them.

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,400
 There's a blind boy, his sister, and his stepmom.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
 And they're all living together.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
 The blind boy is an amazing hunter.

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,680
 He hunts on sound and smell and possibly taste if the creature is close enough, but he can't

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 see them.

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
 So he's like the daredevil of hunting.

83
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
 And his stepmom hated his guts.

84
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
 Absolutely couldn't stand the kid.

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
 Now I don't know how old any of the people are in this story, but I'm going to assume

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,720
 I kept picturing the boy and the girl.

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,120
 Probably late teens, but I could be wrong.

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,640
 Late teens, the stepmom will say she's 30, she's probably a milf.

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,960
 She's probably a milf.

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,720
 Okay, so that's the setup.

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,040
 So a picture where you think that story took place.

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,800
 I thought it took place in merry old England.

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,400
 Or maybe you know like a place with trees and a forest and your hunter.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
 Even after the whole setup, I get to this sentence.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,840
 One day in spring, when food was short and when the ice in the window was melted, a huge

96
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,480
 bear smelling meat attacked the ice hut.

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,000
 What?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
 If it's going to take place in Eskimo Land or it's going to take place in a place where

99
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
 people live in ice, tell me that.

100
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
 In the beginning, say there was a cold wintery day in Eskimo Land.

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,040
 Like don't start me off picturing a gingerbread house and a bunch of people living in it.

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,120
 And then all of a sudden I realize their house is melting.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,600
 That is a plot point that's going on.

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,920
 Their ice in the window was melted.

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
 I guess that could be the ice like, well it doesn't matter because they live in an ice

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
 hut.

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,200
 Anyways, this giant bear shows up, just starts to trash in the place.

108
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,920
 And the boy's blind, so actually why didn't he smell the bear coming because he's a super

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
 hunter.

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,200
 He's beating the house up, the bear's trying to get in the house.

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,400
 The stepmom gives the boy the bow and says, "Kill the bear, kill it, kill it, it's going

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,800
 to destroy all of us, it's going to kill us."

113
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,800
 He shoots at this so funny, so the blind boy is able to find his target and he shoots the

114
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,840
 bear with the arrow.

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
 And the stepmom kills it, kills the bear.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,440
 Stepmom says, "You missed!

117
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,600
 You missed and you shot our dog.

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
 Leave now.

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
 Get on!

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
 Leave.

121
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,920
 That was my favorite dog I liked more than you."

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,760
 She kicks the blind boy out.

123
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,160
 He like, she exiles him, right?

124
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,080
 And the blind boy, this is happening later on in the story, the blind boy's thinking,

125
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,040
 "Wait a second.

126
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,920
 Dogs don't make a huge noise when they fall to the ground."

127
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
 He's like, "I'm pretty sure I killed that bear.

128
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,160
 I'm pretty sure I heard 800 pounds hit the ground, but my stepmom kicked me out of the

129
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
 house.

130
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,920
 She said that I shot the dog instead."

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,720
 So how big was their dog would be another part of the story I want to know a detail

132
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 of.

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
 The little boy's kicked out, right?

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,120
 He goes to another snow house.

135
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,760
 Now they're specifically being called snow houses, so we do know it's somewhere in the

136
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 arctic.

137
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,440
 And they have dogs down there, I guess, and bears?

138
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
 Not polar bears?

139
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
 I don't know.

140
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,600
 He goes to another snow house and he's blind.

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
 Remember, this is a key point.

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
 He's blind.

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,040
 The new house he goes to is abandoned and it's dirty and smelly.

144
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,720
 He describes like, "Oh my God, now how smelly, first off, how smelly can ice get?"

145
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,800
 Secondly, if you're blind, like blind blind, how do you know something?

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,720
 How do you know it's dirty?

147
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,480
 Like you can have daredevil senses, but I don't think he's like rearranging people's,

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,320
 like he's straightening people's pictures.

149
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,560
 You know, sure, if you trip on a soda can, you're like, "Well, that's weird, I'm in the

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,920
 middle of a living room, there's soda can here."

151
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,160
 But you walk into our house and it's dirty and I will say, if ice doesn't smell, imagine

152
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,640
 how smelly something would have to be for you to smell it on the snow.

153
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,840
 Anyways, he's in this house, he's like, "This sucks."

154
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,560
 I wish I was back home even though my stepmom hated me, I'm pretty sure I did shoot that

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
 bear.

156
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,840
 And I miss my sister.

157
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
 I miss my sister.

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,920
 Oh, and I guess I should add this too.

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,120
 She didn't kick him out of the house and he just like walked to this other snow house.

160
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,440
 She basically dragged him there and then abandoned him so he couldn't find his way back.

161
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:32,080
 So quite cruel, quite cruel woman, but a milf, actually she could be a, it kylf like an ice

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,040
 kylf, never mind the stupid.

163
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,680
 So he sent it home.

164
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,920
 Now back at his house and his old house, his stepmom and his sister were eating a bunch

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
 of bear meat.

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,600
 And she's like, "Oh, that was a great plan.

167
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,440
 Like now I have one less mouth to feed.

168
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,240
 We got me and this girl have all this bear meat."

169
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,360
 But the sister really misses her brother so she begins sneaking him out, bear meat.

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
 And it's so funny because she, this part of the story, I'm not making this part up, she

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,760
 brings the shows up at the boys house, the hunters house.

172
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,720
 It says, "Hunter boy, blind brother, I have brought you some food.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,000
 I know you must be starving.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,280
 Here, eat this."

175
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,120
 And he eats it and he immediately recognizes the taste of bear meat.

176
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,800
 And he's like, "I knew it, that's stupid.

177
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,560
 I knew it."

178
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,120
 But here's the thing, why didn't the sister just walk in and be like, "Hey, you did shoot

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
 the bear.

180
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 Here's some bear meat."

181
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
 Like why did she leave that detail out?

182
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,440
 She knew why he got kicked out.

183
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,360
 What if she had to like sit there and like she has a big smirk on her face that he can't

184
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
 see.

185
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
 And she's like, "I wonder if he can tell what it is.

186
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,040
 I wonder if she'll think we're eating the dog."

187
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,840
 Like she should have just said something.

188
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,400
 The sister begins bringing him out food.

189
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 They probably had sex.

190
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,840
 I'm just saying, you know, you're up in the middle of nowhere, it's ice huts, you need

191
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 to stay warm.

192
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
 They probably banged each other.

193
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,400
 But anyway, so the sister keeps bringing the brother food and he's still stuck there.

194
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,480
 Now why the sister didn't take him back?

195
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,080
 You know, the reason why I'm kind of going through this is I should cut to the chaser.

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,920
 This story has absolutely no moral.

197
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,600
 Why someone would tell this legend to their kids?

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,240
 I mean, take the incest part out that I just made up, but why they would tell it?

199
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
 I'm going to start cutting to the chase.

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,760
 He ends up, he's stuck at the house, there's a lake nearby.

201
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,400
 He's really depressed and he thinks, "I'm just going to kill myself."

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,880
 And right when he's thinking about that, a loon, a big old bird jumps out of the water

203
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
 and goes, "What's wrong with your eyes?"

204
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,200
 Straight to the point.

205
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 What's wrong with your eyes?

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 And he's like, "Well, I'm blind."

207
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,080
 And the bird's like, "Tell you what."

208
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,120
 This is something, maybe the loon is a loon.

209
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,400
 It's like, this is something that a serial killer and a cult leader would do.

210
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
 Bizarre trial.

211
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,200
 The loon says, "Tell you what, I can give you your vision back, but you've got to

212
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,000
 grab onto me and I'm going to dive as deep as I can into the water and you've got to

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 hold your breath the whole time."

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,160
 Can't breathe.

215
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
 I've got to do it three times too.

216
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,880
 It's not just one thing.

217
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,960
 So if you haven't died while we're doing this, then you know, I'm going to have a little

218
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
 blind boy for lunch.

219
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
 I'm a carnivore bird.

220
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,000
 But anyways, he holds on to his neck, they go super deep in the water, come up to the

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 surface.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,400
 A little boy's like, "Oh, I can see light."

223
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,280
 And then they go back to the bottom and then come up and the boy's like, "I can see shapes."

224
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,440
 And then they go back super, super deep.

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,680
 The kid's like turning blue.

226
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,720
 He's starting to see the light.

227
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
 He's starting to see the Lord come through the clouds at him.

228
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
 And he's like, "Oh, that's weird."

229
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,240
 He comes back up.

230
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
 I can see.

231
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
 He can see everything.

232
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,760
 So now he realizes that he's cured.

233
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,080
 He goes back to his old house, bow and arrow in hand.

234
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,280
 And the first thing he realizes when he walks through the door is how messy that house was.

235
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,800
 So apparently, like, I guess one of the moral of the story is clean your house, because

236
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,480
 you don't know when blind people will show up, or when blind people will get their vision

237
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 back.

238
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
 Oh, and the loon says, "Don't tell the stepmom you got your vision back."

239
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,000
 It'll be super hilarious if you don't tell her you got your vision back.

240
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 He shows back up at the house and he's like, "Hey, I found my way back here."

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,880
 And he looks over at his sister and his sister kind of bites her lip and like, "Mm, yeah,

242
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,040
 my brother's back."

243
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,560
 So anyways, the stepmom's like, "Good, good, because we need more food.

244
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,360
 That dog only fed us for like four months and she's wearing a bear skin, like bear skin

245
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 gloves.

246
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
 There's a bear skin rug on the floor."

247
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,520
 She's like, "Oh, those are just dogs.

248
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,880
 Those are just big, giant dogs."

249
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,440
 Let's go hunt whales.

250
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,480
 So they go out to the ocean.

251
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,560
 Again, what is going on in the story?

252
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
 They go to the ocean and there's a giant whale and a little whale swimming by.

253
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,720
 And again, he's still pretending he's blind.

254
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,160
 So he's like bumping into stuff.

255
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,800
 She said, "Shoot that little whale.

256
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,080
 I'll help aim your bow.

257
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
 Shoot the little whale.

258
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,240
 We can't shoot the big whale out there."

259
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,160
 And then we'll drag it to shore and eat it.

260
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,360
 So apparently now these people aren't just Eskimos, but they're Nephilim.

261
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,000
 They're basically like 10 feet tall superhuman giants who can drag whales to shore.

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,920
 The blind boy's still pretending he's blind.

263
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,440
 He goes to shoot the little whale.

264
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,040
 Her plan to drag it back to shore is she's going to wrap the rope around her waist.

265
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,080
 Now you see where this is going.

266
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,320
 She wraps the rope around her waist and they're going to shoot the little whale, which still

267
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
 has to be like four tons.

268
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,000
 Shoot the little whale and then she'll brace it and they'll drag it onto shore, which at

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,840
 that point she'll probably say, "Oh no, our dog was swimming and you shot that instead."

270
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,920
 Anyways, pulls back the arrow.

271
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,920
 And the loon shows up, grabs the arrow, flies it farther out to sea and puts it on the big

272
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,600
 whale and the big whale takes off and drags the stepmom, clawing and screaming into the

273
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,080
 water.

274
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,640
 She says, "Help me, help me.

275
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
 You need me.

276
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
 You're blind.

277
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 You can't help yourself.

278
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,160
 You need me."

279
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,720
 And the blind boy turns to her and goes, "I'm not blind anymore."

280
00:13:48,720 --> 00:14:18,720
 Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

281
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,400
 She just found a magical way to get his vision back and then he murders somebody.

282
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,840
 Then he goes home and bangs his sister.

283
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,120
 Now yes, I did add in the incest subplot.

284
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,200
 Makes it a little more interesting, but I was just like, "Who is this story intended

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
 for?"

286
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,280
 Which made it perfect for me to waste 16 minutes telling you about it.

287
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
 I love that story though.

288
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
 I love that story.

289
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
 They should make a movie based on that.

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,760
 They could have, let's see, "Who would we cast as the blind boy?"

291
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 Never mind.

292
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
 I've wasted enough time on this story.

293
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,800
 But you know what, iceberg conspiracy theory list, this is what you deserve.

294
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,320
 Don't put stupid stuff on there like Carlos Pitt because then I have to start reading

295
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,880
 about blind boys banging their sisters.

296
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 Going from that story of familial, I know I didn't pronounce that right, going from

297
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,880
 that story of a loving family, let's take a quick look at Daegu, South Korea.

298
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,360
 Daegu, South Korea.

299
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
 It's a place, obviously.

300
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,920
 But more importantly, we're looking at the year 2003.

301
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,760
 And even more importantly, we're looking at February 18th.

302
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,640
 So Daegu, some of you guys, I'm probably not pronouncing it right.

303
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,440
 It basically sounds like I was saying Ragu, but Daegu, if you're just gonna have to go

304
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,720
 with me on this, my shuttle shows up very shortly.

305
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,640
 I spend way too much time talking about that blind boy, but I gotta take my time with this

306
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,120
 because this is an interesting one just from the way that everything played out.

307
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
 I'm trying not to laugh because I know what's coming.

308
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,360
 So Kim Day Han was this dude, he had a stroke, he couldn't work, he was super depressed,

309
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
 lost his job.

310
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,720
 I know it's great, we started this right after the blind boy story.

311
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,360
 He's 56 years old and he wants to kill himself.

312
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,920
 But there's a problem he also doesn't like being alone.

313
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,000
 He doesn't want to die alone.

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,640
 So technically that's not suicide, that's something else, but he doesn't want to die

315
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 alone.

316
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,400
 He doesn't go on a shooting spree, I guess he doesn't have any loved ones to kill.

317
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,960
 This sounds flippant, I'm sorry, but again I know where this is coming, it's such a

318
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,160
 so bizarre out-ins.

319
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,920
 But in the beginning he says, "I don't want to die by myself."

320
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,880
 Maybe he didn't necessarily want to kill other people, he just didn't want to be alone when

321
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 he died.

322
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,920
 And again, just jump off a building into a crowd of people, crowd surf from 10 stories

323
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,000
 high.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,800
 He decides to get two melt cartons, fill them full of flammable liquid, and take a ride

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,560
 on a subway, the subway in Daegu.

326
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,800
 He gets on train 10.79.

327
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
 And people are sitting on the train, it's early morning so it's mostly full of college

328
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,960
 students and young women going to their jobs in the retail district.

329
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,200
 And he's sitting there on the train and people are just kind of going about their business,

330
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,080
 reading the newspapers.

331
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,840
 And someone notices that he pulls out these jugs out of his duffel bag, he sits them down,

332
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,360
 and then he starts like trying to find a lighter, and then he gets in and he's trying

333
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 to light it.

334
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,380
 And at this point people are getting really suspicious, I'm sure they could smell the

335
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,200
 chemicals as he got on, but now you see a guy fumbling with a lighter, a fight breaks

336
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,080
 out over the lighter.

337
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,560
 People are trying to stop him from doing whatever nonsense he's about to do.

338
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,040
 One of the cartons of liquid gets kicked and spilled all over the subway car.

339
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,880
 He ends up igniting the lighter and he catches on fire.

340
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,000
 Kim catches on fire and immediately freaks out, oh my god, oh my god, what's going on?

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,440
 Oh yeah, I forgot, I was going to try to commit suicide, but this totally hurts.

342
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,320
 And he jumps off the train out of the subway car.

343
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,920
 And quite a few other people get out of the subway car as well.

344
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,080
 But the problem is that you had, it wasn't just one subway car, you had all the cars

345
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,040
 connected together as the subway works.

346
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,160
 And the insulation that was between the outer metal shell and the inner metal shell, so

347
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,520
 you had the outside, then you had some insulation to keep everything warm.

348
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,720
 And then on the inside you had the rest of it, and then you had that's where the seats

349
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
 were and everything.

350
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,520
 The fire actually got into the insulation and shot through the train.

351
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,640
 So if you weren't in that car, it didn't matter.

352
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,440
 All the trains now were burning on the inside of the walls, plastic started to melt and

353
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,200
 everything became pitch black smoke.

354
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,840
 So people in other cars didn't know what was going on, they may have heard a struggle,

355
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,920
 but now their car was on fire in the walls where they couldn't see it and smoke was just

356
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,680
 billowing out everywhere.

357
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,760
 Within two minutes all six cars on that subway train were on fire.

358
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,280
 Either full on, your floor was on fire, or it was on fire in the walls burning all of

359
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,440
 that insulation, choking black smoke.

360
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,800
 The conductor of 1079 doesn't tell headquarters what's going on.

361
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,040
 For whatever reason, he doesn't radio them in and go "oh my god my train's on fire,

362
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,600
 a guy just jumped out, he's on fire."

363
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,280
 A bunch of people ran out of certain train and now they're smoke everywhere.

364
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,400
 Doesn't warn anyone.

365
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,840
 Even 1080 is now pulling into the station in the opposite direction.

366
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,680
 It stops alongside 1079 so now they're both facing in different directions.

367
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,240
 They're both parked next to each other now and the doors open up to let the people out

368
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,280
 of 1080 but just smoke is everywhere at this point.

369
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,680
 So when their doors open up, 1080, they don't know what's going on.

370
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,400
 Black smoke begins filling the subway and they have to close the doors again.

371
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,280
 And again, they have no idea that the subway next to them is on fire.

372
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,640
 The subway train on next to them is on fire.

373
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,800
 The automatic fire detection system in the subway system detects a fire.

374
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,440
 And this is such a weird "safety mechanism."

375
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,600
 What it does is it shuts down power.

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,320
 So all the lights go off and the trains are stuck.

377
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 The power to the rails is shut off.

378
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,600
 The conductor for the train 1080 says "Hey guys, just stay on here.

379
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
 Stay on the train.

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,680
 There's a fire next to us but we're safe in here.

381
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
 Don't worry about it."

382
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,400
 Then he calls in radio.

383
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
 He calls the headquarters.

384
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,760
 The 1080 conductor calls in headquarters and says "What am I supposed to do here?

385
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
 What's going on?

386
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 What's going on?"

387
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
 And they said "We're trying to figure it out.

388
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 Just stay there for right now.

389
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
 Just stay there for right now."

390
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,920
 He tells his people "Stay on the train.

391
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 There's smoke everywhere.

392
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
 We're saving our train."

393
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,080
 Eventually though, his supervisors say "You know what?

394
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
 You've got to get out of there.

395
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
 Get out of the train.

396
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 Get everyone out of the train."

397
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,400
 He panics and he pulls out the master key of the train, jumps out of his train, but

398
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,320
 his master key is what would allow everyone in his train to be able to open their doors.

399
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,080
 So now you have two trains that are stuck once completely on fire.

400
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,120
 The other one, the people are trapped inside in these subway stations and in most subway

401
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,840
 stations at the time.

402
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,120
 No fire extinguishers on the trains.

403
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,720
 No fire sprinklers in the system.

404
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,480
 No emergency lighting.

405
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,920
 Pitch black.

406
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
 Smoke everywhere.

407
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,160
 People trapped on trains.

408
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,760
 People crawling through over bodies.

409
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,880
 Just trying to get away from this fling.

410
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
 In the end, so many people were badly burned.

411
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,160
 They assume 195 people died in this short, brief amount of time.

412
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,760
 Burn to death.

413
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 So many people were burned so badly, they were like "That might be a person."

414
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,200
 The only reason they came up with the number 195, they had to have phone companies go through

415
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,480
 and find out who placed phone calls from that subway to loved ones.

416
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,960
 That is some dark shit.

417
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
 They had to go who placed a phone call from this subway.

418
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,880
 And they're like "Oh, you know, Sally called, looks like Sally tried calling her mom and

419
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
 she didn't get through."

420
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,400
 And they're like "She must be one of the bodies."

421
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:15,360
 That's how badly you were just charred remains in piles trapped in these cars.

422
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 Insane.

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,320
 Because the guy said it goes without saying that.

424
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 The 1080 ended up catching on fire as well because they were so close to each other.

425
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
 195 people burned.

426
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 The only way.

427
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 Now Kim survived.

428
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,600
 He ended up going to prison.

429
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,960
 He got life in prison for multiple murder.

430
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,960
 Both train operators actually got sentenced to prison too for four to five years for their

431
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
 role as a safety thing.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,560
 They weren't following procedures, they got a bunch of people killed.

433
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,840
 It was more of like negligence type of murder.

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,560
 It was considered a national tragedy and South Korea looked back at it and said "We think

435
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,540
 we were so focused on becoming industrialized very quick.

436
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,960
 We cut corners as a nation.

437
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,040
 We said "Let's just hurry up and get this stuff done."

438
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,680
 We weren't thinking fire extinguishers or power not being...

439
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,640
 Let's not shut the electricity off when there's a mass casualty event.

440
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
 Just try that.

441
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,960
 But you're like "Jason, why would you tell that story right before you're about to go

442
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
 on a plane trip?"

443
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,400
 Dude, I got like seven minutes to finish this up, but I don't want to rush this.

444
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
 Because now this is so bizarre.

445
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,440
 That story in and of itself, you're like "Okay, that's a horrible tragedy.

446
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,680
 You've covered tragedies and stuff like that before."

447
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,960
 It wasn't interactive for good reason.

448
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,000
 Now you can go to Daegu, but it is no longer a subway station.

449
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,840
 It is a theme park.

450
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,760
 It is Daegu Safety Theme Park.

451
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,440
 All this stuff is really at this theme park.

452
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,320
 There is a replica of a subway car shaped like the one that the people horribly died

453
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,040
 in with a twirly slide.

454
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,720
 So it's an elevated train.

455
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,160
 It's an elevated subway car.

456
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,240
 It's sticking outside of the building.

457
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,440
 And you can get on it and go "Weeeeeee!"

458
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,400
 Go down a slide out of the same style of subway car.

459
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,840
 These people horribly died in, calling their loved ones choking on smoke.

460
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,360
 You can have the fun way out.

461
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 Weeeeeee!

462
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,040
 The little twirly slide.

463
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,600
 You are shown a video, it's a documentary about the deaths, horrible 195 deaths, created

464
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,480
 by a man suffering from crippling depression.

465
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,880
 You get to watch a movie about that while you're at the theme park.

466
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,920
 And then after watching that movie, you get to go into a replica subway station.

467
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,440
 With the real car in the subway station.

468
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,280
 So you can go now, you can go underground.

469
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,560
 And you can see a car where hundreds of people died and not haunted at all.

470
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,840
 There's no horrible ghost residue there.

471
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,680
 And while, if you just watch this movie, and then you get to see the car where these people

472
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,120
 clawed, tried to claw their way out of the windows while choking smoke when in their lungs

473
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,040
 and their feet burned from the hot metal.

474
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
 No joke.

475
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:12,680
 Then, while you're in the subway, they begin to shut the lights off and pump fake smoke

476
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,280
 to let you simulate the tragedy.

477
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,480
 So you're in there, you just want to imagine this.

478
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,160
 It's the fun safety park, or not fun, it's the Degu Safety Theme Park.

479
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,600
 You go there, you're nine, you're probably with your class.

480
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,080
 You just watch this horrible video and then you go into the subway station with a replica

481
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
 car.

482
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,480
 The power, the lights start to dim and smoke starts to billow out.

483
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,240
 Now the website is there to let you know it is safe smoke, but I'm not worried about

484
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,760
 the physical amount of the smoke.

485
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,600
 I'm worried about the mental ramifications of watching that video.

486
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
 I would think ghosts were attacking me.

487
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,080
 If I went down there and no one said, "Okay, now we're going to pump smoke through here

488
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,640
 and we're going to shut the lights off."

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,120
 I would assume I was in some sort of hellish universe at this point.

490
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,560
 But I was about to get dragged into the eternity of burning to death in a subway car.

491
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,360
 And you go, "Okay, so that's the safety theme park, that's all they do."

492
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,520
 You go down a slide attached to a subway car and you get to watch this video.

493
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,760
 No, there's more because it's safety.

494
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,840
 They got to tell you about other problems in South Korea.

495
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,240
 You can learn about forest fires, which I know South Korea has forest, that makes sense.

496
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,640
 You can also learn how to escape wild pigs.

497
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,880
 Apparently, boar attacks are a big issue in South Korea.

498
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
 And there's an earthquake simulator.

499
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,560
 So out of the tragedy of 195 people being burnt so badly that investigators had to listen

500
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:46,640
 to final voicemails of people saying goodbye to their loved ones or begging for their help,

501
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,920
 out of that you can now go to a theme park and learn how to escape Pumbaa.

502
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
 Or is it Timon?

503
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 One of them.

504
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
 Maybe both of them.

505
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,640
 Maybe they have maricad attacks over there as well.

506
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,040
 But out of all that tragedy, you can now learn what it's like to be in an earthquake.

507
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,760
 What I want to learn is how not to die in a subway car.

508
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,120
 And they teach you that in the most gruesome way possible by simulating you dying in a subway

509
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
 car.

510
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,320
 You can actually see like phones and pieces of the stuff that's all melted and they're

511
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,280
 like, "See, look how bad we were back then as far as our fire suppression technology.

512
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
 It's much better now.

513
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,840
 Oh no, there's smoke billowing through the walls as the power goes out.

514
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,920
 That's absolutely terrifying.

515
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 Absolutely terrifying.

516
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,360
 I can't imagine that stunt being pulled anywhere in America.

517
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,800
 I can't imagine them being like, "Hey, remember that cold Columbine thing?

518
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,960
 Is there a way we can turn that in with theme park?

519
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,520
 Is there a way that we can simulate we have a documentary on Columbine and then while

520
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,160
 you're watching it, we simulate gunfire coming from behind you?"

521
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,960
 And then as you're running out of the school, simulation will have wild boars attack you

522
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,480
 so at the same time you can learn how to avoid wild pig attacks.

523
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 I can't imagine this flying anywhere in America.

524
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,040
 I can't imagine it, but it would be hilarious if someone tried doing it.

525
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,120
 So that is going to be it.

526
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,440
 Today's episode, if you can't tell, was a little more...

527
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,520
 I guess the subject matter wasn't super late-hearted, but I have to go on this trip.

528
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,640
 I wanted to get a couple episodes in the can.

529
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,800
 It's possible that there will not be an episode coming out on Thursday and Friday of this

530
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 week.

531
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,480
 We'll see, because I'm going on the trip and then I'm coming back and all that stuff,

532
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,880
 but I wanted to get some episodes in the can for you guys.

533
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,040
 You guys have been awesome.

534
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,800
 Since I've come back from my break, the download numbers have been astonishing.

535
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,440
 You guys really did come back to the show and it looks like you guys brought some friends.

536
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,560
 So that's really, really awesome.

537
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,240
 I wanted to say that I appreciate all that stuff.

538
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,800
 You guys are great.

539
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,320
 So I'm going to go finish getting dressed.

540
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,960
 I got 29 minutes to do it.

541
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
 You guys have a great day.

542
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
