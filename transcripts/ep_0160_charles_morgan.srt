1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
 A man who lived in a UFO shaped house goes missing.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,120
 Did aliens take him?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:17,360
 And then we take a look at the story of Charles Morgan, a man seemingly normal by all outward

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
 appearances.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,040
 But when he runs into his own home wearing broken handcuffs, telling his family that

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,120
 he has been kidnapped and tortured, it's only the beginning of a bizarre story today

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,120
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:40,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,400
 I hope you're having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,840
 It's 547 AM.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,400
 Just woke up a little bit ago, but my shuttle to take me to the airport leaves at 730.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,920
 So I want to see how many of these episodes I can bang out and that way I can have a little

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,800
 bit more of a restful stay while I'm hanging out with my family and friends in Sacramento.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,280
 So we're going to bust out a couple of these.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
 I think we'll be good.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,840
 Now, the first story we're going to talk about is the story of a man named Granger Taylor.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,520
 Now I first came across this story because it was considered an alien abduction story.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,920
 Here's two of the headlines of the articles we're going to be talking about.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 An abduction?

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,520
 An unsolved case of a man who disappeared after building UFO reopened.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,960
 I'm pretty evocative.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
 Another headline.

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,440
 The man who went to space and disappeared.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,880
 So this story's been going on for a while.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,080
 This was kind of, it wasn't a super well known common UFO abduction story, but I had

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,240
 heard of it a while back.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
 Quite a while back.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,040
 Not necessarily when it happened, but I heard about it in the 90s.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
 So it's not completely obscure people were wondering about this, but let's go ahead

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
 and get into the story here.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
 Okay, so there was a man named Granger Taylor.

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,480
 We're in the year 1980.

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,240
 We haven't busted this out for a while.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
 Let's take the carbon or copter.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
 So I got to check the oil.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
 Let's get out.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
 And there it goes.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
 Get back in.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
 Numatic field.

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
 And this might take a while.

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,040
 So while we're going to have to hire a maintenance crew to come out and fix the carbon or copter,

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,520
 but even though we're on the deadline and I kind of get a bunch of episodes done, we

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,080
 do get the carbon or copter finally flying.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:38,720
 And we're flying from Hood River, Oregon to Vancouver, Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,880
 Sometimes the city of Vancouver gets flooded in a circle and Vancouver becomes Vancouver

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 Island.

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,080
 Little known fact, but you didn't know that.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,120
 Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,760
 We're flying overhead and we can look down from the helicopter and we see a UFO on the

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 ground.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
 We're like, awesome, dude.

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 UFOs.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,480
 They act technically it's not a UFO if it's landed, right?

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,280
 That's just a ULO.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920
 An unidentified landed object.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,880
 But anyway, so we land next to it.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,640
 We find out it's not a UFO.

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,920
 It is a tree fort that an adult built, but no tree.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,040
 It's just a fort then.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,520
 It's a fort that an adult built in someone's backyard.

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,920
 I believe it was his parents backyard, but it is shaped like a UFO.

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 He built it himself.

65
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,800
 Now Granger Taylor was considered a fairly gifted child when it came to things like engineering

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
 and design and things like that.

67
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,400
 He was kind of a do-it-yourselfer and he built this big UFO shaped house in the backyard.

68
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,880
 Again, he's an adult, but you know, every adult has kind of odd hobbies.

69
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 It's not not a big deal.

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,600
 I do think it's weird that he was living in it, but he just really, really, really liked

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 UFOs.

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:53,640
 So he would tell people that he would tell people about alien abduction experiences, but

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,920
 he wanted to be abducted by aliens.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
 He really liked the thought of being abducted by aliens.

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,640
 So that's the thing.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,200
 Most people are scared of alien abductions.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,840
 It would be the, and people may go, well, you know, he just wants to be abducted.

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
 He wants to meet some little great people.

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 Little great people.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
 That's the thing.

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
 Really, we say abduction.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 It's kidnapping.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,920
 Now, if you knew someone who was like, you know what, I really want to be abducted by

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 like the Russian mob.

85
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,320
 He'd be like, what the hell are you talking about, dude?

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,500
 You would think they either had a death wish or they had a fetish.

87
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,640
 But when people talk about they want to be abducted by aliens, people are like, oh yeah,

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,480
 you know, mysticism, you know, maybe you'll learn some stuff from the aliens.

89
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 It's the same thing.

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,320
 You're basically being kidnapped and you probably won't come back.

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 So he would talk about being abducted by aliens all the time.

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,520
 He really wanted it to happen.

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
 And then one day he disappears.

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,740
 So I know I'm being a little flippant towards this story and you might think it's disrespectful

95
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,400
 at the end, but there's a reason why.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,920
 So Granger Taylor disappears and nobody knows what happens to him.

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,560
 And the way it was always reported in UFO media was maybe he was abducted by aliens.

98
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,600
 Maybe the aliens were communicating with him and wanting him and they knew he wanted to

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,960
 be abducted and he disappeared.

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,680
 Hence the titles of the two articles that I chose and most of the articles have headlines

101
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
 like that.

102
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,840
 Now, he said a friend of Granger said that aliens talk to him telepathically and you're

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
 like, okay, you know, aliens are talking to him telepathically.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
 He has this bond with them.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
 Again, if I'm getting phone calls from the Rush Mob every day and I'm telling my friends,

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
 oh my God, you won't believe you called me yesterday.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 It was Vladimir.

108
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
 He's going to kidnap me this week.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,920
 You'd be really, really concerned.

110
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,480
 But the friend was like, yeah, he said he was talking to aliens telepathically.

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,960
 So at that point you can say, well, you know, he's talking to aliens telepathically.

112
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
 I believe in UFOs.

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,040
 Maybe that's true.

114
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,200
 And then you could say, well, you know, he got abducted.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,640
 He lived in UFO shaped house.

116
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 He wanted to be abducted.

117
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,120
 He was talking to aliens telepathically.

118
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
 That could be true.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
 This is where we start to get into the actual reality of things.

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,760
 Those things aliens may or may not be true, but this is where the rubber hits the road.

121
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,000
 And this is where at any point people were going, maybe he was abducted by aliens.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
 I'm glad Yogi Bear is a guest star on this episode.

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
 Hey, boo boo.

124
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
 He wanted to get abducted by some aliens, I guess.

125
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,880
 This is where every article should have been like he probably didn't get abducted by aliens.

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,760
 One, his sister said, oh yeah, yeah, no, he talked about talking to aliens.

127
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,360
 He really wanted to get abducted.

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,760
 He also took acid every single day and not just every single day, a few times a day.

129
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,560
 So he's dropping huge amounts of acid.

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,960
 That's when you go, oh, okay, now the story's getting a little bizarre.

131
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,720
 He also, when he magically disappeared and got abducted by the aliens, he left a goodbye

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
 note and two wills.

133
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,640
 So now when I read the first article, I was like, it sounds more like a suicide.

134
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,000
 And you know, you could be like, oh, that's insensitive.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,920
 Maybe he really did get abducted by aliens and he wanted to leave these notes.

136
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
 This was his note.

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
 It's kind of heartbreaking.

138
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,920
 Note, dear mother and father, I've gone away to walk aboard an alien spaceship as reoccurring

139
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,800
 dreams assured a 42 month interstellar voyage to explore the vast universe.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 Then return.

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,160
 I'm leaving behind all my possessions to you as I will no longer require the use of

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,800
 any.

143
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,680
 Please use the instructions in my will as a guide to help.

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,800
 Love, Granger.

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,280
 So again, if you're getting a note like that and he's dropping acid all the time a few

146
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,840
 times a day, you're going to be a little concerned.

147
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,200
 But people for years were like, he just floated away.

148
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 He just floated away.

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,880
 Now, like I said, I had heard the story, I think in the nineties and they left out a

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
 key detail.

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,080
 They left out a key detail because a lot of times that'll happen.

152
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,400
 You take the evidence you want.

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,920
 You're like, oh, I believe in aliens or I mean, I believe in aliens and I'm going to.

154
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,200
 Okay, I'm not going to do that voice anymore.

155
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,840
 I believe in aliens and this guy said he was talking to aliens and he disappeared.

156
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
 Case closed.

157
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,760
 There is another key development in the story in 1986.

158
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:18,240
 They find his truck and a bunch of bones, but the truck was blown up and his bones were

159
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
 all over the forest.

160
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,360
 He borrowed some dynamite from his parents and blew himself up.

161
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,560
 Now there are people who say maybe the explosion was an accident because he actually knew how

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,000
 to handle dynamite, but that actually makes it less of an accident.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,640
 So what it seems and we'll cover this is this plays in another story we're going to cover

164
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,800
 very famous UFO encounter kind of has the same feeling.

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,600
 It kind of seems like he really wanted to be abducted by aliens.

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,520
 I think the the I think the good version of the story is he wanted to be abducted by aliens.

167
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:02,080
 He was driving on his way to the alien abduction point and dynamite accidentally went off blowing

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,200
 up his car and himself.

169
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,880
 The bad version of this story is he was dropping so much acid and so delusional that the aliens

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,080
 may have said you need to blow yourself up to join us.

171
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
 You need to straight heaven gates yourself.

172
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,240
 You need to to ascend to the alien spaceship.

173
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,160
 You need to leave your body.

174
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,520
 So drive to middle of nowhere and blow yourself up and your spirit will go into our spaceship

175
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,440
 or whatever nonsense and he did it on purpose.

176
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,080
 But it's it's weird because that's that's the complete story.

177
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,960
 Like you can't leave off the dynamite part.

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,760
 And even in articles where they mention it, it's kind of like, oh, well, they did find

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,120
 some bones in his car and a dynamite blast.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,640
 But but no, I mean, that's the end.

181
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,760
 It sounds like he got kind of in over his head with some delusional behavior.

182
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,320
 His friends didn't intercede.

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,640
 Weren't like, well, maybe you're not, you know, maybe if you think aliens are going to take

184
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
 you, maybe you shouldn't leave the dynamite at home.

185
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,240
 Because that's really where we see stuff like Heaven's Gate where the Colt were like, oh,

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
 there's UFO coming.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,120
 But to join it, you got to drink this poison sad story.

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,480
 And I know that's the thing like it started off really flippant.

189
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,600
 But it's more, I think it's I'm being more flippant towards the way the story was handled

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,960
 and is still handled today.

191
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,720
 The headline should not be the man who went to space and disappeared or unsolved case of

192
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,120
 man who disappeared after building UFO reopened.

193
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,920
 He blew up.

194
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,660
 That's the answer.

195
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,960
 And it was just kind of it was kind of dealt with like, oh, maybe maybe he did get abducted

196
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
 by aliens.

197
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,880
 No, he blew up the end.

198
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,080
 So we have to, we have to, you have to admit stories like even if they fit your narrative,

199
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,160
 you sometimes have to take them and discard them and go, well, that guy didn't get abducted

200
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 by aliens.

201
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,160
 He got abducted by the combined force of dynamite and gravity.

202
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
 Sorry, Granger.

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
 And again, that might sound flippant, but we have to be realistic with this stuff because

204
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,880
 the subject is already so unrealistic.

205
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,200
 Anyway, and this is going to pop up a few more times of people who quote unquote mysteriously

206
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,040
 vanished and then we find out afterwards that it was most likely they didn't get abducted

207
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,200
 by aliens.

208
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,120
 And one of them is a very famous alien abduction story, by the way.

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,520
 We'll get to that though in a future episode.

210
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,600
 So let's go ahead and now I feel bad.

211
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
 I feel bad for making fun of that.

212
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 Oh, you know what?

213
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,400
 Let's let's cleanse the palette real quick here.

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,480
 I'm going to do a very quick dead rabbit recommends.

215
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,840
 It's a, is this episode, this episode is coming out on Tuesday, but so this one's early.

216
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,160
 I normally do them on Wednesdays, but this is going to be real quick.

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,440
 Most of you guys know the franchise.

218
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,480
 I'd argue that all of you guys know the franchise, but not everyone knows about this part of

219
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,800
 the franchise.

220
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
 The Matrix trilogy.

221
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,240
 I'm not going to recommend any movies from the Matrix trilogy.

222
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 The first one was great.

223
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,040
 The second two were, eh, but that world was really rich in the beginning.

224
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 I think they kind of ruin it with the last two movies, but there is a two part and it's

225
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,880
 on YouTube, solely available on YouTube.

226
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,560
 However, the quality is not that great.

227
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,000
 I would recommend trying to track this down if you can a higher res version of it.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Even getting a copy of it.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,800
 It is something I watch quite often.

230
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
 I wouldn't say I watch it like every day or every month, but every show often I'll get

231
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
 a hankering to watch it.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
 It's called the second renaissance and it's a two, it's about 20 minutes altogether.

233
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,560
 It's two 10 minute cartoons about the rise of the machines and it is one of the most

234
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,720
 visually compelling stories of a sci-fi apocalypse.

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,560
 It's one of the most visually compelling stories about the rise of AI and the fall of

236
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
 man.

237
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
 It's absolutely beautiful.

238
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,920
 It's calling the cartoons probably a disservice.

239
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
 It's more of an anime.

240
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,160
 It tells the story of how the robots went from simply being manual laborers to one of them

241
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,840
 being put on trial for murder to a robot uprising and how the humans deal with that.

242
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,480
 And the first part is the rise of the machines and the second part is the war between machines

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
 and man.

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,600
 It is amazing.

245
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 It's amazing.

246
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,400
 I definitely recommend watching "Taking 20 Minutes Out of Your Day" even if you watched

247
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,920
 the low-rise version, but "Taking 20 Minutes Out of Your Day" to watch the second renaissance.

248
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,240
 It's just a great piece of sci-fi and some of the imagery is so stark and depressing.

249
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
 It sticks with you.

250
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,640
 There are certain images from the cartoon that you're like, "Oh man, you think about

251
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
 it from time to time."

252
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,240
 I remember I had a friend over, Jonas, he came over one day, me, Jonas and Jacob were

253
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,280
 hanging out and Jonas had never seen the second renaissance.

254
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,640
 I was like, "Hey, you got 20 minutes?"

255
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,880
 He's like, "Yeah, sure."

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,200
 And we watched it and me and Jacob had seen it before and we're like, "Oh yeah, it's

257
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 totally awesome.

258
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 Dude, he's a badass.

259
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,960
 Dude, watch this scene because it's really, really good."

260
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,360
 And Jonas was sitting there and then after it was over, he just kind of goes, "His response

261
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,800
 to watching it for the first time was, I go, 'What'd you think?'

262
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,520
 And he goes, 'I got to think about this, man.'

263
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,680
 Like, whoa, like, that's a lot to digest."

264
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,880
 And it was funny because we were like just hanging out as buddies and they show him this

265
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,120
 really depressing, in the end, really depressing anime.

266
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,520
 He goes, "I don't even know."

267
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,160
 It was like I was showing him snuff videos on LiveLeak.

268
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
 It really affected him.

269
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,240
 And then you think about it, you're like, "Yeah, it was a really cool sci-fi, but it's very,

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,480
 very grim, very, very good.

271
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,120
 Dead Rabbit recommends the second renaissance.

272
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,400
 I'll have the YouTube links if you can find a high-res version.

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 It's amazing."

274
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,600
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,040
 The next story is another story that's a mystery.

276
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,280
 This one is, doesn't involve UFOs, but involves something far more devious.

277
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,440
 So the year is 1977 and now we're in Tucson, Arizona.

278
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,960
 Charles Morgan, it's a beautiful morning day, which we're not usual mornings are.

279
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,920
 Charles Morgan runs into his house.

280
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,680
 His family's sitting there, they're eating Cheerios.

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,120
 Life kids are all eating Cheerios together, wife's reading newspaper, piping her mouth.

282
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,040
 Charles Morgan runs into the house, handcuffs on his wrists and ankles.

283
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,920
 Broken obviously, he's not like scooting into the house.

284
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,760
 Making these noises, but he can't talk and his wife's like, "What's going on?

285
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,000
 What's going on Charles?"

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,920
 He then gets a pen and paper and he writes down, "I can't talk because a hallucinogenic

287
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,880
 drug was put in my mouth."

288
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,840
 Now I'm going to make an assumption here, he probably didn't spell hallucinogenic,

289
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 right?

290
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,520
 They don't have spell check in 1977 and they don't have spell check when you use a pen

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,000
 and paper, but anyways, he starts writing vague because his wife's like, "Well, who

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 took you?

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Who took you?"

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,240
 And he would just write things like they, them.

295
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,560
 He was very vague about who he was kidnapped by and he said that he got away.

296
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,040
 He also hinted that he was a government agent and the wife is like, "Oh."

297
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,000
 And he's like, "I can't talk, right?"

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Totally freaks out.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
 Now what's funny is that nowhere in the re-- it's funny, just a dude got kidnapped,

300
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
 but what's funny is nowhere in the rest of the article do they really state he regains

301
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,280
 the ability to talk.

302
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,400
 So I assume he did because then he goes about his daily life later on, but you think like

303
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,720
 once he was able to talk he would be able to explain it better, but the articles always

304
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
 leave that part out which is when did he learn the ability to talk again.

305
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,080
 But anyways, after the event we'll assume that he can talk at some point.

306
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,760
 He's like at work.

307
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,240
 "They're like great, great idea Charles."

308
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
 He's writing everything down.

309
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,560
 "And you spilled hallucinogenic right, you get a raise."

310
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
 He won't let his girls go anywhere alone.

311
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,160
 He's super super paranoid, but life continues.

312
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
 Life continues.

313
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,080
 They go to a baseball game as little girls are playing baseball.

314
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 He's like "Ugh, ugh, ugh."

315
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,000
 Two months later he disappears again.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 He disappears again.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,960
 And you think at that point his wife's like "Charles, oh that wacky Charles, he's gonna

318
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,320
 go get drunk again."

319
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
 That would be my first thing.

320
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,960
 If someone came in wearing handcuffs and were like "I can't talk but this is what happened."

321
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,920
 I would assume they had something to hide because I don't know if any drugs would just

322
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,160
 make you not be able to talk.

323
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,760
 I'd be like "He probably just doesn't want to talk."

324
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,400
 So it sounded like a setup.

325
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,480
 It sounds like a setup.

326
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
 Like a guy coming in and he's like "Oh my god, I just got attacked by a bunch of whores

327
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,160
 at a whorehouse but luckily I got away.

328
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,520
 I wasn't there to have sex with them."

329
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,640
 It sounds like that type of setup.

330
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,240
 But two months later he disappears again.

331
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,480
 In June 1977, so let's see, March, April, May he disappears again.

332
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,520
 I should figure all this out before I start the episode.

333
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,280
 In June 1977 he's found dead.

334
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,680
 So obviously he wasn't larping the first time.

335
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,520
 He actually did get kidnapped by someone, got away or they let him go.

336
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,760
 And then two months later he goes missing again and then he's found dead.

337
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,640
 He has a bullet in the back of his head embedded into his mouth.

338
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,680
 So the bullet came through the back of the head, knocked it tooth out and it's sticking

339
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,000
 out of his mouth.

340
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,040
 He was found with a bulletproof vest and a knife.

341
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,440
 His gun was used, he had a gun with him too.

342
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,320
 He had an empty holster.

343
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,280
 His gun was used apparently to commit the crime.

344
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,640
 So you go suicide.

345
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,560
 Now people always go "How do you shoot yourself twice in the back of the head?"

346
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
 It can happen.

347
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 It can happen.

348
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
 Depending on the type of gun.

349
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,200
 Sometimes that's always things like "That guy didn't kill himself."

350
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,400
 But you can shoot yourself in the back of the head and sometimes through muscle reflex

351
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,040
 you can shoot yourself twice.

352
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
 Pop pop.

353
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,320
 You get one bullet in the back of the head and the other bullets farther back up in the

354
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,400
 skull coming out of the top or through the back of the skull headed down because your

355
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,960
 hands move in one way or another due to the force.

356
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,120
 But it can happen.

357
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,320
 You can shoot yourself multiple times in the back of the head.

358
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,080
 But he was shot in the back of the head.

359
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,920
 Bullet lodged in his teeth.

360
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,600
 He was killed with his own gun.

361
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
 So suicide.

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,480
 He went into his house.

363
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,120
 He wove this tale of he's possibly a government agent.

364
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,440
 He then runs out of the house later.

365
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
 Or maybe run out of the house but two months later he goes missing again.

366
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
 He's found with a bullet in the back of the brain coming out of the back.

367
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
 His gun was used.

368
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 So on and so forth.

369
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,080
 So you think maybe it's just a suicide.

370
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,680
 Maybe it was a set up for a suicide so his family could get life insurance.

371
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,400
 Let's dig into the details here a little more.

372
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,640
 One of his tooth that got knocked out by the bullet was wrapped in tissue and placed in

373
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,520
 his car that was there.

374
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 I guess I should have said that.

375
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,240
 His body was found by his car out in the middle of nowhere or you know out in the boonies.

376
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,720
 He gets shot in the back of the head.

377
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
 Tooth comes out.

378
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,400
 Somebody wrapped his tooth in a piece of tissue.

379
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,520
 Put it in his car.

380
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,600
 There was a pair of sunglasses in the car that weren't his.

381
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,280
 Now that stuff could easily be a mistake and the wife could be like he doesn't own

382
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,920
 those but he may have bought them without her.

383
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,080
 But I don't think someone's going to shoot themselves in the back of the head and then

384
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,400
 be like oh a tooth put this for the tooth fairy put it in their own car and then collapse

385
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
 and die.

386
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,520
 So the working idea is someone else was there.

387
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,440
 But some other there's more this story is really weird.

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
 It's not like the last story the Granger Taylor story.

389
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,120
 It's pretty cut and dry.

390
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,040
 You think okay then this guy didn't kill himself.

391
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
 Somebody else did.

392
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,720
 That's cut and dry right well it still gets weird here.

393
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,760
 He had a $2 bill attached to his underwear and probably that way in case somebody took

394
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,280
 his wallet the note would still be there.

395
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,360
 He had a $2 bill attached to his underwear that he was wearing not like in a suitcase.

396
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,040
 It had a list of Spanish names on it and a Bible verse.

397
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,960
 It had Ecclesiastes 12 1 through 8 and then there was a code next to it.

398
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,320
 He also had a map pinned to his underwear.

399
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,440
 Now I'm imagining like a huge random McNally map going from your waist to your knee but

400
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
 it was probably just a little piece of paper and the map was showing where he was at.

401
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Where he was going to.

402
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,160
 So it was most likely a map for him to get there but actually that doesn't make sense

403
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,520
 either because then did he keep taking his pants off to see he's like okay take a left

404
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
 pull his pants back up.

405
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,600
 So anyways before his body was found so he goes missing two months later and there was

406
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,000
 a month between when he went missing again and when he was found his wife gets a phone

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,760
 call from a woman who identified herself as green eyes.

408
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,920
 She said Chuck is alright and everything will be alright.

409
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:42,000
 Ecclesiastes 12 1 through 8 hangs up.

410
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,960
 So now it's really really weird.

411
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,640
 The wife tells the police about what happened and again they don't know that he's dead

412
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
 at this point.

413
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
 They just have that phone call.

414
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,760
 The wife says this woman called me she said this the woman then goes to the police and

415
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,560
 the police have never revealed who green eyes is but they know her they met her they talked

416
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,120
 to her and police are like okay yeah the story checks out and the wife's like well who was

417
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,320
 that and they're like we're not going to tell you who green eyes is.

418
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,680
 So that means she's either a spook or an informant.

419
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,800
 She's either like a CIA/FBI operative or she's a criminal informant.

420
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,360
 But anyways so she just by saying Chuck is alright people get crank calls all the time

421
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,400
 when these crimes happen.

422
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,680
 Little kid goes missing the parents will get calls and saying all sorts of whacked stuff

423
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,080
 I'm a psychic or I killed her whatever they get tons of crank calls but the fact that

424
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,520
 she mentioned the bible verse that would later be found on his body shows that she knew something

425
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 about it.

426
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,840
 He had a briefcase Morgan had a briefcase full of money he took it with him.

427
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,200
 Here's one of the theories that so Charles Morgan in his job he worked in escrow in Arizona

428
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,880
 they have what's known as a blind trust so you could have properties owned and nobody

429
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,160
 knew who owned them but of course that only goes up to a certain level in the government.

430
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,120
 So I want to be able to find out who owned this house but the government needs to know

431
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,440
 who owns that house for tax purposes and part of his job was knowing being able to access

432
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,000
 who owned what.

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,600
 The idea was this he found he uncovered some sort of big scam or criminal scheme he found

434
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,560
 information on people who were like buying houses and selling them or doing criminal

435
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:35,680
 activities in them or money laundering or whatever he then began communicating with the FBI or

436
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,480
 local authorities.

437
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,520
 To the point and this is all stuff that's kind of in piece together this is kind of

438
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,280
 the working theory to the point that a contract a hitman contract was put out on him.

439
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,960
 The theory is that he drove out to this location he ended up getting a briefcase full of money

440
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,800
 and I don't believe the money was found at his body I think that was gone as well but

441
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,280
 people knew that he had a briefcase full of money I may be wrong on that detail they may

442
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,880
 have actually found the money but I'm not for sure and again I have to leave like in

443
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 an hour.

444
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,240
 The theory is this what was going on there was a hitman contract out for him it was gaining

445
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,720
 like $5,000 a day the contract was only getting bigger he drove out to meet the hitman to

446
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,600
 pay him off to end the contract and instead he got killed.

447
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,960
 Afterwards his car was broken and his car was impounded it was broken into his office

448
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,280
 was ransacked and two men showed up at his now what just wife's house claiming to be

449
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,960
 FBI agents and they ransacked the house and she goes I don't know if they're FBI agents

450
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,680
 they just kind of flashed their badges they came in moved everything around and that was

451
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,640
 it so all of that being said we have green eyes we have the story of the hitman we have

452
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,120
 him running into his house with the handcuffs the bullet in the back of the head the tooth

453
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,680
 placed in his car the sunglasses that worn his a briefcase that may or may not have gone

454
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,040
 missing the police after all of that caused a death suicide.

455
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,120
 Car gets impounded and broken into no he killed himself no one outside killed this guy that

456
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,640
 was their official ruling he committed suicide.

457
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
 Now it's not impossible for you to shoot yourself in the back of the head find your

458
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,120
 tooth fell out put it in a piece of tissue put in your car it's not impossible it's unlikely

459
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,040
 but that's what the cops ruled it doesn't sound like a suicide to me at all sounds like

460
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,080
 one of those stories that just kind of the cops are like ah bizarre case though and

461
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
 as far as the police are concerned it's been solved it's been solved you know his behavior

462
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,680
 was weird before generally if you commit suicide you don't get life insurance for your family

463
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,600
 I know some states are different with that but if you're able to make it look like a

464
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,880
 murder or an accident you can get life insurance.

465
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,800
 But we're gonna end it like this let's take a real quick look at Ecclesiastes thought

466
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,040
 it was an interesting verse because it kind of speaks to the mind of somebody who may

467
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,120
 be at the end of their rope or maybe know that they're gonna die very shortly this is

468
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,120
 the this is the verse that was written on his two dollar bill the whole verse wasn't

469
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,160
 written there but remember your creator in the days of your youth before the days of

470
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,400
 trouble come and the years approach when you will say I find no pleasure in them before

471
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,440
 the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark and the clouds return after

472
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,160
 the rain when the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men stoop when the grinder

473
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,640
 cease because they are few and those looking through the windows grow dim when the doors

474
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,560
 to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades when people rise up at the sound of

475
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,080
 birds but all their songs grow faint when people are afraid of heights and of dangers

476
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,620
 in the streets when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags itself along and

477
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,800
 desire is no longer stirred then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about

478
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:57,320
 the streets remember him before the silver cord is severed and the golden bowl is broken

479
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,720
 before the pitcher is shattered at the spring and the wheel broken at the well and the dust

480
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,680
 returns to the ground it came from and the spirit returns to God who gave it meaningless
