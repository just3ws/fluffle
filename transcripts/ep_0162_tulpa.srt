1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A true story of a man who waged a war against an army.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Totally true, it's crazy.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at the interesting topic of Tulpas.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Is it possible to create a fictional character that only you can see, only you can touch?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then that creation turn against you today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. I'm home.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I don't know how many of you listened to an episode or two back.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I had to do an emergency broadcast from an airport.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm telling you man, getting trapped in an airport is soul crushing.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 My buddy mentioned he got trapped in an airport somewhere in South America for like 36 hours.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 He said every time he goes, "It was okay, but every time I tried to fall asleep,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 a guy with a rifle would show up and wake me up and make me move."

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 They don't like you sleeping in airports.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Now, PDX was great. They were really good.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I actually went up and explained my situation to them.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I said, "Hey, the freeway is closed. I don't have money for a hotel."

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I had cash, luckily, but I was like, "I don't have hotel money. I had like 90 bucks on me."

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 So, I'm sitting there and I go up to the Panda Express.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 The prices were pretty reasonable for Panda Express.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I was just hanging out and I was like, "Okay, just got to hang out here for a couple hours.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 The shuttle company will take me home tomorrow.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Fingers crossed that the freeway will be open then."

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Shuttle company was great as well. USA Shuttle Service, I think is the name.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But anyways, they did pick me up the next morning, but that night, man, sucked.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And it's interesting because I figured for the first-- I got landed at 4.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 By 10 o'clock, I had an awakening. I had a-- not a literal awakening.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I couldn't fall asleep, but I realized something.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 This was not going to be what I expected.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 My mom was super worried and stuff like that.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 My friends were like, "Oh, no, you're trapped."

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And I said, "Ah, you know, it's just like being trapped in a mall."

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And around 10 o'clock, while I'm eating my Panda Express, I get panhandled.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 A guy comes up to me and goes, "Wait, do you have a dollar? Do you have like a dollar?"

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 He asked specifically for a dollar 80, which I thought was weird, but--

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 "Do you have a dollar 80? I need to--"

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I was like, "Well, I mean, I'm not going to even open my wallet up.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I'm very leery around street people.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I've had bad experiences in the past, so I just reached into my pocket and pulled out some change.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I go, "Here you go, man."

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I threw it on the ground and made him grovel for it.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I'm just joking, but it's like, "Here you go."

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 That's when I realized the game had changed.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I wasn't going to be seeing an airport with other stranded travelers,

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 people waiting for their flights or, you know, pilots and hot stewardesses.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 It started to turn into a bit of a homeless shelter because the weather was so bad,

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 so I don't fault them for wanting to go there, but apparently it's an ongoing issue.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And that's when I said, "Okay, I have to go into survival mode.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I have to go into Jason Circa 2005 survival mode."

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I had to do stuff like I had to tie my luggage together,

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 so nobody could have just run by and grab a piece of luggage.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I had to make sure that all of my electronics were nearby.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Like, if I was using my tablet, I put all my phones away.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 If I was using my phone, I put my tablet away or my laptop or whatever.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And then around 2 in the morning, I was starting to lose...

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I was like, "I really need to get some sleep."

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I'd been up all day. I woke up at 5 a.m.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I had had a three-hour-long dance contest, which I won, by the way,

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 so I was exhausted from that as well.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And so I was like, "I was so lucky. It was funny.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'd seen this in my bag and I was like, "I'm not going to take it out because I'm lazy."

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But from a trip or two ago in my suitcase, I had some Benadryl.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And around 2 a.m., I couldn't sleep. The lights were so bright.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Plus, I was afraid that a homeless person was going to come after me.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I don't like sleeping in public anyways. We've talked about that.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I took the Benadryl, took it, slept for about 2 hours.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But here's another tip, too, when you're sleeping in public in a situation where you think something might get stolen.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Like I said, I lashed my luggage together, actually then lashed it to my foot,

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 so no one could run by and grab the backpack of a sleeping man.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 But I did get home. It totally sucked.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 It took a lot out of me and I slept all the next day. Not all the next day, but...

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Ugh! Sucked.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Okay, so for our first story.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 The year is 1997.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 The place, Sierra Leone,

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Will Scully's on the roof of the Mammy Yoko Hotel.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And he's in a water tower that's been partially blown out.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Like, missing a side.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 He's sitting up there with the rifle, not his, that he had to steal from a Nigerian soldier.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 [Squeaking]

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Shooting down, shooting down at rebellious troops.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 He's up on this hotel.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 [Squeaking]

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Watching these troops get closer and closer to where he's at, to where 1,000 people are hiding in this hotel from the chaos outside.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 [Squeaking]

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Drops the clip, puts another one in.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 [Squeaking]

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And that's when he sees a rocket.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 [Squeaking]

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Coming right at him.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Will Scully was an SAS operative who ended up leaving the SAS to do private security consulting.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 He went to the Sierra Leone and his job was two-fold.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Was to train troops loyal to the president.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And to protect a bunch of nerdy geologists because they were looking for ore deposits.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So I know what I would rather do.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'd rather hang out with the other army people than hang out with a bunch of bookworms.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But anyways, he was doing both of them.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And while he was there, there was a junta.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 There was basically the military that wasn't loyal to the president said, "Ah, we knew better than this guy."

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And then they began attacking various places around the country.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 His first job was to get the geologist out.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 He's like, "Sorry, Militia, I train you as much as I can, but I gotta get these nerds out. They're still playing with the rocks and stuff."

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And they just don't understand what's going on.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 He finally gets them to put down their rocks.

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Geologists are like, "Maybe we can build some sort of catapult and throw bigger rocks."

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 "No, no, no, just go, just go. You're way outclassed for this stuff."

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 His first job is to get the geologist out of there, because that's what he was hired for.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But then he is told to go to the Mamayoka Hotel.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 That's where all the Westerners are at.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And Will Scully goes into the hotel and he says, "The first thing that I realized was that everyone was completely freaking out."

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 "To be fair, outside the hotel was utter chaos."

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 People were looting and raping and murdering and stuff like that.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And the army hadn't even gotten there yet.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 The conflict hadn't reached that town, its free town.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 They hadn't reached it yet.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But the utter lawlessness of not knowing what was coming next made everybody panic outside the hotel.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Inside the hotel, people were panicked. They weren't chopping each other up.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But Will Scully was like, "This is not good. This isn't a good situation."

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He takes it upon himself to begin to go out into the chaos to get food for a thousand people, brings it back.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 The story sounds unrealistic, but trust me, it's all been verified.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He ends up leaving the hotel a couple of times getting food.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He commandeers the kitchen. He's like, "You don't know how to make filet mignon. I'll do it."

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 No, that didn't happen.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But he commandeered the kitchen and he told all the cooks, "You've got to make enough stuff for a thousand people."

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 "I'll keep going out and getting food, but we've got to keep these people fed. They're freaking out."

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It's a hotel, so there's families there and stuff like that.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But at one point, what happens is a bunch of Nigerian soldiers that are loyal to the president break into the hotel.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And the army is on their way here right now, and they're going to slaughter everyone in this hotel.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And Will's basically like, "You didn't have to say that in front of the thousand people that are eating their fruit cups right now."

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We need to learn a little bit about tact.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But he goes, "Okay, we have to deal with it."

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 So let's go, the set up of perimeter, you go this way soldier, you go that way soldier, and they're like, "No, we're not fighting."

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 "We're just going to hide and hope that we survive the massacre."

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 "We've got these other uniforms we're just going to put on."

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Now, Will Scully is like, "We have to defend this place."

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He goes up to the roof of the Mamayoko Hotel.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 There's a bunch of Nigerian soldiers up there just kind of hanging out.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Not really preparing for what's coming.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So he's like, "Okay, those soldiers down there are a bunch of cowards, but you, you and you, you take up that position."

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 "You take up that position."

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And they're like, "No, we're not going to do that. We also got these other uniforms we're going to put on."

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So he is up there and what he has is the Nigerians don't want to help him fight, but he has all their rifles.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 On the top of this hotel was, for whatever reason, I guess this is standard practice in Sierra Leone,

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 but on the top of the hotel there was also a rocket launcher and the machine gun.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So in the world of Fortnite, he landed in a really good place.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He has all these great weapons.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 He's like, "Hey, why is this machine gun glowing gold?"

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 He also has an ally on the rooftop, kind of.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 There is another Westerner on the rooftop. There's another British guy. His name is Major Lincoln Jop.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Will Skully's like, "Oh, thank God you're here."

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And he's like, "Hey, Major, so we're going to fight these guys off."

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Now this is super bizarre. Major Lincoln Jop said, "Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't fight."

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 If I shoot anybody officially, the British government is involved in this war.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So I can't, I can't help you, dude.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Sips a little bit of tea. He's like, "Ugh, great."

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So he's just by himself.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 A literal one-man army.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And that's when he sees the Jeeps coming in.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 From distance, all surrounding the hotel.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 A bunch of Jeeps coming in.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Not just any Jeeps, army Jeeps.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And not just any army Jeeps, but rebellious army Jeeps.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And he's like, "This isn't, this, this really can't get any worse."

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He then begins a one-man war against this army.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 First off, heavy machine gun.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Just laying into these dudes, taking them out.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 He sees them starting to assemble a heavy machine gun in the street.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 They are ready to take this hotel.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And once he's, like, he basically, it's like in the movies, he's running from one edge to the other.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Shooting, drops the gun, goes, gets another gun.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 G-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 For hours.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And that's where we find Will Scully in the water tower.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That's halfway blowing out.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And he's shooting at these dudes and pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Shootin' at these dudes and *pfft*.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Now, there's a lot of things you don't want to see coming at you.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 A rhinoceros, an elephant, well I guess pretty much any big animal you don't want to see coming at you unless you're a matador.

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But one of the least things you ever want to see coming at you is a missile.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And he sees it coming at him and he's thinking, "Okay, this is it. I'm gonna keep shooting, but I'm dead."

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 The missile flies between his legs.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And blows out the back of the water tower.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He's deafened, he's covered in blood, and he thinks it's his at first know it's the major who was just hanging out also in the water tower,

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 because he's gonna do anything else.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Got blown a bits by the rocket.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And he's like, "I, whoa, I survived. I guess I get to keep playing."

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Keep shooting. The battle goes on for three hours.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 The Rebel troops can get nowhere near the hotel.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Nowhere near the hotel.

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And at one point he sees a van now driving towards him.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He's thinking, "This is it, mini-boss. After this I get to fight the floating head of the Rebel general, but this is the mini-boss that's gonna turn into a mech."

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And there he notices that they're not shooting at him.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 So he is thinking like, "This is something coming at him. A car bomb or whatever."

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 He lines up a shot, gets ready, and in the quiet of it he's thinking, "Yeah, just give it a second. Give it a second."

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And off in the distance he sees it start to turn a corner and he notices a big red cross on the side of it.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He's like, "I almost blew that dude's brains out."

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He probably shouldn't have come straight out the hotel.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 The red cross had negotiated a ceasefire to get the Westerners out of the building.

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And they did all end up getting evacuated.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Now what's sad about that is like the red cross probably should have just negotiated an evacuation for the whole city.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But they're like, "Yeah, everyone else."

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yeah, at one point when Will Scully was up there on the roof, he saw a guy get chopped up with a machete

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and that vision was constantly running through his head.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Like, "If we lose, I'm gonna get chopped up with a machete."

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 So he had no ground to seed. He had to fight.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And fight, he did.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Took a rocket between the legs, got a bunch of major blood on him.

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He ended up getting awarded by the Queen for valiantry and bravery and all that stuff,

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 which I mean, that's exactly what it was.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Imagine you're... we tend to imagine ourselves in a die-hard type situation.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 But I have no real experience with firearms.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I mean, it'd be nice for me to crawl through air vents.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Well, air vents aren't big enough to hold me or most people,

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 but it'd be nice to crawl through air vents and jump down and snap people's necks.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's funny because we can daydream this stuff.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It'd be like, "Oh yeah, I'm the last one left and I'm fighting the zombie apocalypse.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I'm the last one left and I'm fighting all these soldiers."

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Imagine this stuff, but then some people are actually willing or able to do it.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And he was willing and able.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 There was a story the other day in Colorado.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 A dude killed a mountain lion with his bare hands.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And I can almost guarantee you that that dude was a guy like Will Scully.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 If a mountain lion attacked me, I would like to think I could kill it with my bare hands,

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 but I couldn't.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But men like Will Scully and men like this unknown dude who straight-up strangled a mountain lion

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 or beat it to death or whatever, we don't know how he killed it.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 These people do exist.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It's quite fascinating. It's quite fascinating.

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I mean, to fight a three-hour battle against hundreds of troops that have you outgunned,

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 that is almost the definition of a superhero.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Your superpower just happens to be not peeing your pants

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and being able to shoot hundreds of people multiple times

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 and then get drenched in someone else's blood and being like, "Where's my award, your highness?"

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 So hats off to you, Will Scully. Hats off to you.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Do they say that in Britain? T's off to you, Willie.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Probably shouldn't call him Willie. He'll murder me.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

240
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Now our next story is going to be the story of Tulpas.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Now, Tulpas were actually... My friend Aaron, he requested this topic a long, long time ago.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 He goes, "Hey, you know about Tulpas? We were talking about Twin Peaks

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and Tulpas are a big part of Twin Peaks." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I know about Tulpas."

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Now, let me get into what a Tulpa is real quick.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Because I was like, it's an interesting story, but I wanted to find the right spin on it.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Because it is fairly well known among the world of paranormal, at least it is now.

247
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And I was like, I really like the idea of Tulpas, but I don't want to just talk about what Tulpas are.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I have to find a good angle on it. And boy did I find a good angle on it.

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 But let's talk real quick about what a Tulpa is. What a Tulpa is, in brief, it's like an ancient Tibetan practice.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 But what you do, there's tons of guides on how to do this online, but I don't have to read any...

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 After telling you these stories, I don't think you'll want to do it.

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 A Tulpa is basically where you create an imaginary character.

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And you're like, "So, everybody does that."

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 You don't just say, "Oh, look it, here is Pinko, the Communist Infiltrator."

255
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 No, this is Pinko, the tiny elephant. You basically have a little friend named Pinko.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I probably should have picked a different name, but a little Pinko, a little baby elephant that walks around on your table.

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And it's like, "Hey, Jason, you want to go play?" And you're like, "Yeah."

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 It's more involved than that. You basically take a part of your consciousness and seed it.

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Not like seed it with like a plant seed, but you actually give it up to Pinko, or just to a Tulpa.

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So, you basically create a thought form. So, let's go over... This is basically how it is.

261
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So, let's just keep going with a Pinko example.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So, Pinko is my tiny baby elephant. And first, I just imagine that Pinko is there.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But then I really start to imagine what type of personality does Pinko have?

264
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 What are his likes? What are his dislikes?

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 How did he grow up? And you're just thinking, "Jason, this is just, again, what people with imagination do."

266
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 But you give it life by concentrating on it so much.

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 More so than a writer will sit down and go, "Hmm, I wonder what Darth Vader does on his off time."

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Like, this is you are taking a part of your consciousness and creating this thing.

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It takes a lot of concentration. It takes a lot of time.

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Because the end result isn't to have a fleshed out character on the page or on the screen or on a painting or anything like that.

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 The idea is to create a creature that you can interact with.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So, I'll be sitting here and I'll be like, "Hey, Pinko, what do you want to have for lunch?"

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "I don't know. How about a pickle?"

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And I'm like, "Well, that's interesting. I was thinking of a pickle, too."

275
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And so you engage it in conversation by talking to it and by thinking about it. You're helping it grow.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 To the point where you go, "Hey, Pinko, what do you want to have for dinner?"

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 "Mmm, chicken pot pie."

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You're like, "That's weird. I haven't had chicken pot pie in years."

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I never, never ever thought about chicken pot pie.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It begins to develop its own personality.

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Now, I'm sure a lot of you are clueling in right now. Basically, another way to describe it is schizophrenia.

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 You're basically taking part of your brain and creating a separate personality in that brain on purpose.

283
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Not due to any sort of medical problem or traumatic brain injury.

284
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You're creating a voice in your head that you can have a dialogue with.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And the key is you know the tulpa is starting to become real because it begins to surprise you.

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It begins to make decisions or say things that you don't expect it to do.

287
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 The goal of the tulpa, though. Well, the goal is varied.

288
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But the higher form of the tulpa, really what people who make tulpas want,

289
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 is they then want to be able to interact with the tulpa not just by thinking,

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 but where one morning I wake up and Pinko is sitting on my windowsill being like, "Ready for a great day, Jason?"

291
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 "Oh, Pinko, yeah, it's beautiful outside. That's what I thought too."

292
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Really creepy when you think about it. Really creepy when you think about it.

293
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And the goal is so when you look over to your couch, Pinko is sitting there eating popcorn.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And you're like, "Oh, no, I'm allergic to popcorn!"

295
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 No, but you will see him interacting with you.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But to do that, you have to spend time like visually imagining, picturing what Pinko looks like.

297
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And not just, "There's a pink elephant on my table," because you'll learn,

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 and the stories I'm about to tell you, how that backfires.

299
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You have to basically build it from the ground up what the skeleton looks like, how the muscles work.

300
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 If you just imagine a pink elephant, you're building this and you do it wrong,

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 there's literally just like a blob that looks like an elephant sitting on your table going, "Kill me!"

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 You have to imagine it as a living being.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So that's what a tulpa is. It's basically a, and here's the thing, you can't stop it.

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Because once you have spent so much time and energy and mental focus creating it,

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 it's not like you can go, "You know I'm done with you, Pinko," and then forget it.

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 It is part of your personality now. You will see it forever unless you go through some pretty drastic measures.

307
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Most people who create tulpas say that they use them for like to boost their creativity,

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 or to boost their spirituality. Like, you're basically talking to yourself and they'll be like,

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "Oh no, no, I know I'm talking to myself, but it's giving me access to parts of my brain that I had forgotten that I had.

310
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I forgot that I like chicken pot pie," until Pinko told me. Now I realize I love it.

311
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And that's kind of where the idea of tulpas started.

312
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 It was an inner journey, but like everything, it's become a sex thing.

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 It's become something you can have sex with.

314
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Now, tulpas came to my awareness, not through Twin Peaks or not through Tibetan philosophy.

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It came to my attention when people were trying to make tulpas of My Little Pony characters to have sex with them.

316
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 So you'd concentrate all day long on a My Little Pony character on Rainbow Dash or Sparkle Dazzle or Marky Mark or whatever.

317
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And you remember its personality and how much you love it on the show. It's whatever.

318
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And then eventually you picture it so much that you wake up and there's a pony sitting in your bed,

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 kind of biting its lip, you know, looking seductively at you and you're like, "Ooh."

320
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So that's what it's become. It's become a sex thing.

321
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 There's a couple of things they say don't make tulpas based on people you know, because they will have a different personality.

322
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Technically, I could create a picture-perfect version in my head and eventually be able to hallucinate a picture-perfect version of a real-life woman.

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I could have Scarlett Johansson walking around my apartment all day long.

324
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 But her personality won't match up because her personality is basically part of mine,

325
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 which my answer to that is I really don't care what her personality is like. It's Scarlett Johansson.

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But they say don't base it on real people because it'll have a different personality that will be really weird.

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And then two, they say this too, don't base it on fictional characters for the same reason because it won't have the same personality.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 So we got people being in ponies. We got people trying to create these tulpas, basically giving themselves induced schizophrenia,

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 which isn't supposed to be a slur against people who have schizophrenia or a slur who uses this for some sort of spirituality.

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But basically, you are creating an alternate personality in your brain that you think is real that you can see and interact with and talk to.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So split personality is probably a better term for it.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You're creating a split personality that only you can see.

333
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So now Aaron wanted me to talk about tulpas. He did not request what's coming next.

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So I don't want anyone to think, "Man, that dude's super weird."

335
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He just said, "Hey, do you want to talk about tulpas?" Because we're getting into some weird stuff now and you've got banging ponies was weird.

336
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So there's this cartoon called Steven Universe. Now, I know a bunch of you are like, "Oh, I know where this is going."

337
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 There's this cartoon called Steven Universe.

338
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it's about a dude, a little chubby boy, who hangs out with a couple chicks who have the power of rocks or gems or something like that.

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I watched a couple episodes because I was kicking it with as Chicky was into it.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 But oh, and people tell me it looked like Steven Universe too. So I was like, "Ah, check it out. It's okay."

341
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 I don't really remember any of it, but they have these different gem chicks that run around with these special powers.

342
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And people have tried to create them as tulpas.

343
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 There's a character named Pearl, and she's just this tall skinny chick who has the power of a pearl or something.

344
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And a guy was like, "I want to have a pearl tulpa. I want her to interact with me in my life."

345
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Now, it's interesting because he creates this tulpa. Supposedly he creates it.

346
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 We're going to assume these stories are true and these guys aren't larpon.

347
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 But this guy creates a tulpa of pearl.

348
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Cartoon character, by the way. So I don't know how that works in the real world. Does it look like CGI?

349
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Like, I'm assuming it's 3D. I'm assuming it's not just two-dimensional thing.

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 So this guy had been posting on 4chan for a while about his pearl tulpa.

351
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Talking about how things are starting to go sideways with his creation.

352
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And then this was the most recent post that I could find.

353
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 "I've been awake 64 hours straight.

354
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Last you heard of me, my pearl tulpa was trying to convince me to leave my parents' house

355
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 and buy a one-way ticket to Oregon. You end up in the airport with me."

356
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Despite the advice I had gotten that came from some good hearts in my previous thread,

357
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I didn't. So that's good he didn't come to Oregon. Not that I have problem with him.

358
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But anyways, we're going home with a quote here, "And she got mad. Real mad.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Lately she's been spending time insulting me in demeaning and embarrassing ways.

360
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Making fun of my current neat lifestyle and bringing up incidents in my adolescence

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 that I don't even recall telling her about."

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So neat is an acronym not employed in education or training.

363
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Basically means you just don't have a job, you're not going to school,

364
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 probably living at home or on some sort of welfare or anything.

365
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 So she's basically making fun of him for being a loafer.

366
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And she's telling him about stuff that happened when he was a kid.

367
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He doesn't remember about it, but she doesn't matter because it's all part of the same brain.

368
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 She told me that the girl I like knows that I fancy her, and she finds me pathetic.

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Now, right there basically, another poster said, "You know what? It sounds like you're not happy with your own life.

370
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 The tulpa is just departing on brain. You're not happy with your own life.

371
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So what this tulpa is telling you is stuff that you already don't like about yourself.

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 You don't like the fact that you don't have a job, you don't like the fact that you're not in school.

373
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You're concerned about the girl that you really like thinks you're a loser.

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 She's just throwing this stuff at you."

375
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And that, I mean, we all have negative thoughts. The goal is to override them.

376
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But this is where it goes from just having a negative Nancy kind of floating around your head.

377
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Figuratively, to having a thought form standing in front of you, literally.

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 This is where it starts to get nasty.

379
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Now, remember at the beginning he said he'd been up for 64 hours. Here's why.

380
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I've been refusing to sleep because she threatened to possess me when I'm asleep

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 and ruin my life before making me kill myself.

382
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I don't even enjoy my regular activities like playing emulators, sorry,

383
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 and browsing X anymore because every time I do, all she does is ridicule my inadequacies the entire time.

384
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Every waking moment, all I do now is argue and attend to her. I want out of this.

385
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I wasn't responsible and stable-minded enough for this to ever work.

386
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I was warned and now I can't get rid of her. How do I make it stop?

387
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 So he's created this alternate personality, this hallucination.

388
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 She tells him to move out of his parents' house and buy a one-way ticket to Oregon.

389
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And he refuses to do it. She begins berating him and then she says,

390
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 "When you fall asleep, I will possess you."

391
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Now, what's funny about all that is on one of the Topa forums I was on

392
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 or one of the Topa websites about creating Topas, they're like,

393
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 "You can let your Topa possess you and that way it will give them an experience of what it's like to be alive."

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It's totally harmless. There's no way the word "possession" and "harmless" should be used together,

395
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I guess unless you're talking about, "These are my possessions."

396
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 But when you're talking about a physical possession of you, there's never harmless.

397
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 That's harmful. See, opposite.

398
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Anything that's like, "Hey, you can create this and you can talk to it and have fun with it and maybe have sex with it."

399
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And then eventually it may possess you. That's a bad path to slide down.

400
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 This guy's saying, "This thing's going to possess me. This thing's going to get me if I fall asleep. I can't get rid of her."

401
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Now, it's interesting because even he says I wasn't stable enough to make this in the first place,

402
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 so he was having some issues, but he has given some advice to stop it,

403
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 mostly to create a Jackie Chan Topa to beat it up.

404
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So that's probably not a good thing if you're already having one mental problem to create another Topa

405
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 and why Jackie Chan, I'm not for sure.

406
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But that is... I would do that story.

407
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Like, if that was me and I created Pinko and he's like, "Buy one-way ticket to Oregon."

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I'd be like, "Cool, I'm already here." And he's like, "Nah, I mean go to Wyoming."

409
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I'd be like, "Ugh."

410
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And then Pinko's talking about possessing my body and stuff like that.

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That's doable versus what's coming next.

412
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Now, we have another, again, totally unrelated, a dude decide, this second story.

413
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 This dude decides, "This is why this is dangerous, guys.

414
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 This is why creating Topas is no joke."

415
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But that story is what it is.

416
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He's dealing with self-inflicted mental illness.

417
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 This next story, this guy is not only dealing with self-inflicted mental illness,

418
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 but is quite monstrous in his own right.

419
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I'm sorry if you listen to this show, because I picked these.

420
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The guys who write these are anonymously.

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 They could be like, "Hey, I've been listening to your shows since episode one."

422
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Here's another guy, totally unrelated, who created a Tulpa from a Steven Universe character.

423
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 This one was a character named Peridot, which apparently is some sort of mineral.

424
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So he creates--he goes on to 4chan and he says, "I created a Peridot Tulpa,

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 but I don't like I did it right because she has no arms and legs,

426
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 and she's been screaming for three days straight."

427
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 So now he has this self-inflicted hallucination that is an armless, legless version of a cartoon character

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 rolling around on his carpet in his bedroom screaming.

429
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Now, it's one of those things that you can't go and buy earplugs for.

430
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 The screaming's in your head, and you can't really tell anyone about it, because they'll lock you up.

431
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Oh no, I'm hallucinating this armless, legless cartoon character is rolling around screaming on my head.

432
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 People start questioning him on 4chan, like, "First question is, where's her arms and legs?"

433
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Second question is, "Why is she screaming?"

434
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And the third question is--no joke--

435
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 "Why don't you just create a Jackie Chan Tulpa to beat it up?"

436
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So, anyways, he admits after a while the reason why--he never says why it doesn't have any arms and legs,

437
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 but the reason why it was screaming is because he had sex with it.

438
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 So he created this thought form.

439
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Wait, no, no, no, I gotta pause here for a second.

440
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I'll let that sink in.

441
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Now, we talked about banging the ponies, but that is always people kind of like,

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 "Oh yeah, I'm gonna create it, and I'm gonna love it," and stuff like that.

443
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 He created a character, it came out deformed, and he still decided to bang it.

444
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And it's been screaming for three days.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 He basically raped his own brain.

446
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 At the best, he raped his own brain.

447
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 At the worst, Tulpas are actually some sort of spiritual entity.

448
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 You bring into the world through some sort of gateway, and then he raped that.

449
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 In his defense, because people are like, "Dude, you totally raped it."

450
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 That's why she's screaming for three days.

451
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 In his defense, he said, "How can I rape something when it came from me?"

452
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 So, moving on from that, weirdo.

453
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Like, that's... don't ever have kids, man.

454
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 But anyways, he says, "I didn't rape her, I created her."

455
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Another excuse was, "She's part of me, so it's basically masturbating."

456
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 But he's created this physical thought form, this deformed physical thought form.

457
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 All the help he's getting is creating Jackie Chan Tulpas.

458
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 He gets that suggestion multiple times from multiple people.

459
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 He then decides that maybe he should try to create another period-alt-tulpa with arms and legs.

460
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 That's not a good idea.

461
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Not a good idea to have another one.

462
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 But it takes a long time to create a tulpa.

463
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 He's trying to figure out something to do now.

464
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 He tried to erase her from his mind.

465
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 He tried to basically concentrate that she wasn't there, which is that whole thing.

466
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 He's trying not to think of a pink elephant, trying not to think of PINKO.

467
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And he says she started to fade away, but then she came back and screamed even louder.

468
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 He then began to talk to her and was able to calm her down, to apologize for that horrible, horrible act.

469
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 He inflicted upon a sentient creature whether or not he's part of her brain.

470
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 She's now in the real world.

471
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 He apologizes to her for that.

472
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 So she stopped screaming.

473
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 She just would cry, which is horrible.

474
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 He kept trying to hug it and it would warm away on the ground.

475
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So it's weird because if we go to this idea that it's part of his brain, his brain knows what he did was wrong.

476
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And it's acting in the way that a victim would act.

477
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 This is very, very odd.

478
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Like he created it to have sex with it.

479
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And whether the screaming was the creature screaming or it was his own guilt because he realized he did something was wrong.

480
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 He's still manifesting these psychological problems.

481
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And then he can't get it to calm down.

482
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 So is it because his brain was like, "Dude, no, you raped your own brain.

483
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 You created something super bizarre how this whole thing works."

484
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And then at the end of the whole thing, he does end up saying, "I got her to calm down."

485
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 But then I happened to be totally unrelated.

486
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I happened to be masturbating.

487
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And I was looking for something and I turned and I just on her on the little armless legless peridot.

488
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And now the creature screaming even louder.

489
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 His last post that we can actually verify of him is, "I think I'm going to shoot myself guys.

490
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 I can't deal with this monster I created."

491
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Can you take part of your personality and create a fictional character in it?

492
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Yes, we do it automatically as we're kids.

493
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 They're called imaginary friends.

494
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Can you concentrate on that so much that then you basically begin to hallucinate voices in your head, a dialogue between those two things?

495
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I'd say yes.

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 I think that's what authors do.

497
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 I know that's what I do as an author.

498
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 I write characters.

499
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 My characters will do stuff that surprises me from time to time.

500
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Sometimes I'll write a story and I'll want the characters to do one thing and the story will stall out.

501
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I'm like, "Why did the plot hit a dead end?"

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And I'll have to back up a chapter and go, "What if the character did this?"

503
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And then the plot moves along super smoothly.

504
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Because as a writer, I'll write something and I'm basically writing the characters to do something that they wouldn't want to do, or wouldn't make sense for that character.

505
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And then you back up, you go the other direction.

506
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 So yes, I do believe that you can create things that actually surprise you, that have a life of their own.

507
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Do I think that you can create a tulpa?

508
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Can you can create an hallucination that you can then see and interact with?

509
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 This is the interesting part for me.

510
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I don't think so.

511
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I don't think so.

512
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Not to get metaphysical on a paranormal podcast, but I don't think that's what tulpas necessarily are.

513
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 I think that that they...

514
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 This is my theory, is that the tulpas are actually...

515
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 At a certain point, you have opened a gateway in your perception to see something else.

516
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 To their stuff out there in the universe.

517
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That is formless.

518
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And you have given it form.

519
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And it may seem like a part of your personality.

520
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 It may seem like a friend, but it is alien.

521
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It is not from you.

522
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And depending on how you treat it, it can be aggressively evil.

523
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Or just a little off from the rest of humanity.

524
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But either way, even according to the good websites talking about tulpas, it can possess you.

525
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And that doesn't sound like something a true friend would do.

526
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:21,000
