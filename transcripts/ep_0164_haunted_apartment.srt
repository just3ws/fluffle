1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 A lot of people kill for love.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 A lot of people die for love.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,460
 But would you be willing to smell for love?

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:19,140
 And then we take a personal look as I invite you in to my haunted apartment today on Dead

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,140
 Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,940
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,820
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,260
 Thank you, thank you, thank you for everyone who has purchased stuff from my merch store.

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,900
 Because I was trapped in the airport, I spent more money than I had budgeted and today or

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,060
 about yesterday I got my first set of sales from my merch store.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,020
 I got the money and people had been buying stuff but it finally hit a threshold.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
 I got some cash.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,500
 So I was able to buy some groceries.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
 I bought a bunch of salami and some diet Mountain Dew.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,740
 I had to buy a little lantern from my backpack so I don't get hit by a car because it's

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,140
 super dark.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,180
 And yeah, no, thank you everyone for buying the merchandise.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,540
 If you do want merchandise, the link will be below or in your little app.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,980
 But thank you.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,980
 People are really liking it.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,620
 It's amazing to think that people have like Dead Rabbit, one guy bought a Dead Rabbit

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
 poster.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,620
 That's awesome.

26
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,180
 People are sending me photos of themselves in Dead Rabbit shirts.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,180
 That's amazing.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,180
 That's really, really awesome.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,620
 Again, hats off to Ash Black and Grant Scott, the creator of the artwork, the creators

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,300
 of the different artworks.

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,460
 Thank you so much for giving me such amazing images that I love and people love as well.

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,420
 So and thank you again for everyone who has purchased items from the merch store because

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,740
 just that little amount of money that kind of shouldn't say little but and again, thanks

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,660
 to everyone who's purchased from the merch store already because the money came in right

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,300
 when I needed it.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,620
 It's very expensive to be trapped in an airport.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,220
 Now the second story is going to be my ghost department story and it wasn't something that

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
 I originally planned.

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,380
 But here's a little bit of a teaser.

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,620
 When I came home to my apartment today, something was off and it made me realize it's time to

41
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,540
 talk about my apartment.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,700
 But before we get to that story, a little bit of a teaser, a little bit of a teaser, before

43
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,140
 we get to that story, we are going to France.

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,700
 So hop in the Carbentercopter.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,220
 I like how the Carbentercopter always sounds like it's about to die, but it doesn't.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,340
 It's a great helicopter.

47
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,980
 It's treated us very well.

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:40,140
 We're flying all the way to France and to get there, we also have to go back in time.

49
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,980
 Now we're in the year 1876.

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,740
 A hundred years before I was born.

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,020
 So imagine me as a non-caporial entity during this story.

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,340
 We're going to Poitoye, France, and you guys are shocked that I pronounced that right.

53
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,460
 It's the only reason I pronounced that right because I was in a play.

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,700
 I was King Richard the Lionheart and I kept calling it Poitier and they're like, "It's

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,460
 not Poitier, it's Poitoye."

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
 Which is stupid.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,460
 It should be called Poitier because it reminds me of Sydney Poitier, great American actor.

58
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,180
 And that's what it's spelled like, Poitier.

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,860
 And now people are going to go know it's not Poitoye either, whatever.

60
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,620
 It should have just been Poitier from the beginning.

61
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,340
 So we're going to Poitier... we're going to Poitier, France, yeah.

62
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,740
 That's how I'm going to pronounce it.

63
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,900
 Poutrois, okay fine.

64
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,700
 We're going to Poutrois, France.

65
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,820
 I don't even know anymore.

66
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,660
 So we're there.

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,100
 We do know we're in the right location because we see a beautiful young brunette woman arguing

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,740
 with her mother.

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,580
 The young brunette, very shapely, pretty hot French chick.

70
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,780
 Her name is a terrible name though.

71
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
 Blanche.

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
 Blurgh.

73
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,500
 Blanche, Monia.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 Monia.

75
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,300
 So Blanche, gross.

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,980
 Why would you name your daughter Blanche?

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
 What is that?

78
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,420
 That makes me think of Bland and a branch which is already bland in and of itself.

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,180
 But anyway, so Blanche is talking to her mom, Madame Moniere.

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,260
 Her name wasn't Madame, but that's what she was known as.

81
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,180
 And that's what the article says she was.

82
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,820
 So they're arguing.

83
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,500
 Now, the Moniere family was a very... they weren't super wealthy, but they were well off.

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,820
 Yeah, they're doing pretty good for themselves.

85
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,620
 And Blanche fell in love with an older man who didn't have a lot of money.

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
 And that really set the mom off.

87
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,300
 The mom wanted Blanche to find a proper suitor to, you know, marry into money.

88
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,420
 But instead Blanche, 25 years old Blanche fell in love with a man who just was kind of...

89
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,340
 He was a lawyer, but I guess he wasn't a very successful one because he wasn't upper crust.

90
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,100
 He was just a little bit of crust.

91
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,540
 He was upper crumb, maybe.

92
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,460
 He didn't have enough money to go all the way to upper crust.

93
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,740
 He was just a little bit of the bread flaking.

94
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,180
 This fight went on for a long time.

95
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,460
 The mom's like, "You have to marry somebody rich."

96
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,100
 And Blanche is like, "No, my heart belongs to older lawyer."

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,580
 They never said his name.

98
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,260
 She wants to marry an older man who doesn't have a lot of money.

99
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,300
 And the mom wants her to marry someone who has a lot of money.

100
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
 So we see them arguing.

101
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,740
 And the argument is over this.

102
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,700
 Blanche is madly in love.

103
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,700
 Madly in love.

104
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,100
 And you'll realize that it really redefines that term.

105
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,340
 Is madly in love with...

106
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,740
 She's 25 years old.

107
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,140
 So she's madly in love with an older man.

108
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
 That's good.

109
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,100
 There's nothing wrong with that.

110
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,700
 But he isn't very well off.

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,740
 He is a lawyer, so he, you know, is living off more than Salami and having to attach lanterns

112
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,300
 to his backpack.

113
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,460
 But he doesn't have as much money as Blanche's mom wants him to have.

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,020
 Now Blanche has two...

115
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
 Okay, okay.

116
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,420
 So Madame Monnier has two children, Blanche and then a son as well.

117
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,260
 And her son is a well off lawyer.

118
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,820
 And she really wants Blanche to marry into money and help the household get richer and

119
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,580
 build all these social connections and so on and so forth.

120
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,900
 Blanche absolutely refuses.

121
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,380
 And she goes missing.

122
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,060
 Whenever people asked about what happened to Blanche, the mom would be like, "Oh, just

123
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,620
 ran off.

124
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,540
 Must have ran off with somebody sipping her tea."

125
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,900
 In the house, her brother, Blanche's brother, and the servants in the house were not allowed

126
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
 to talk about Blanche.

127
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,220
 Were not allowed to ask about Blanche.

128
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,980
 They weren't allowed to know anything about or really ask or even question or even dream.

129
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,380
 Unless not a dream that Blanche was in the house, they started whipping him.

130
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,700
 Or were supposed to have no conversations about Blanche.

131
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,380
 The lawyer that she was in love with, so the story starts off like I said in 1876.

132
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,060
 The lawyer she's in love with dies in 1885.

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,620
 So about nine years later, he passes away.

134
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,780
 Blanche doesn't show up to the funeral.

135
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,740
 He's not in contact with Blanche.

136
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,180
 But the Monnier family is so well off that people aren't really suspecting anything.

137
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,700
 They're not thinking, "Well, maybe she was murdered or something like that."

138
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,540
 They believe the mom when she said she left.

139
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,540
 In 1901, someone writes a letter to the local French police.

140
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,300
 Nobody knows who wrote the letter.

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,820
 But the police get this letter and it says there's something going on in the Monnier

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
 house.

143
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,100
 You have to investigate it.

144
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,660
 There's this horrible thing happening there.

145
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,140
 I was like, "That's weird."

146
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,260
 Now for whatever reason, it's funny because like I said, I used to be a journalist.

147
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,300
 We would get crackpot stuff all the time sent to us.

148
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,340
 I should talk about one of those stories one of the times.

149
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,180
 But anyway, so the cops get all sorts of crazy info sent to them constantly.

150
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,940
 But for whatever reason, the cops took this one fairly seriously.

151
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,380
 We don't know the details of the note.

152
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,720
 So it must have been fairly descriptive, but it did make the cops go, "Let's travel

153
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,420
 out to this rich person's house and just see what's going on."

154
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,980
 So the cops get in their cop car.

155
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,540
 In France, I'm sure they make different noises.

156
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,300
 They do that annoying "Wah, wah, wah" like the Ghostbusters car.

157
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,340
 But anyways, so they're driving the Ghostbusters car.

158
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,340
 They're driving the Ecto-1 across the French countryside.

159
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,300
 They go to Poitiers and they come up to the Monnier house.

160
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,980
 And there they're greeted by Madame Monnier.

161
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,740
 And she's like, "Oh no, everything's totally fine.

162
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,260
 I don't know why you guys would be here, but I am a socialite and you are guests.

163
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,100
 So come into my house."

164
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 Thank you Madame.

165
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,180
 She's like, "That's my first name."

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,500
 And they're like, "Well, that's weird."

167
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
 They're walking around the house.

168
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
 They're looking around.

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
 Spotless.

170
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,260
 The house is beautiful.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,460
 All the servants, the maids in a hot French maid outfit, which, you know, because they

172
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
 have to wear them.

173
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,860
 That's why they're called that.

174
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,900
 And the lawyer's son is gone.

175
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,620
 He's in a local town doing lawyer stuff.

176
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,620
 Cops are looking around.

177
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,380
 They're like, "Oh, this, this, yeah.

178
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,820
 I mean, this house doesn't seem that sinister."

179
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,380
 But you know, we're just checking out, "Oh, yes, we, we, that's, that is what you do.

180
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,380
 You are the police."

181
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,780
 She's like, "Is that the Ecto one out there?"

182
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,700
 And they're like, "Yeah, we gotta go bust some ghosts after this."

183
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,780
 Marie-Anne Chouinette's been flying around.

184
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,780
 She's seen a bunch of hot dogs and blood anyways.

185
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:16,220
 So the cops are kind of looking around and nothing's really sticking out of them.

186
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,260
 Nothing's like super bizarre to them.

187
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,300
 Again, they just fought gozer.

188
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:28,700
 So they're getting ready to leave when one of the cops upstairs goes, "What's that terrible

189
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
 smell?

190
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,020
 That is a God awful smell."

191
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,180
 So he goes down and he tells his other cop buddies.

192
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,500
 He's like, "Hey guys, before we leave, let's, let's come up here.

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,740
 I want you to double check something."

194
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,380
 So they go up there and they smell this.

195
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,500
 I mean, just unimaginably bad smell.

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,780
 They're like, "What is go- What is the smell?

197
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,860
 This house is so beautiful.

198
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,940
 Why doesn't this part of this house smell so bad?"

199
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,940
 So they start sniffing around.

200
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
 Sorry, sorry.

201
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,860
 I'm going to resist.

202
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,380
 They start sniffing around and they find a door with a padlock on the outside and the

203
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,740
 smell is stronger outside the door.

204
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,420
 So at that point the cops are like, "I bet you there's a body in there."

205
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,020
 There has to be something in there.

206
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,820
 There has to be what this note is about.

207
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,100
 It smells awful.

208
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
 So they bust the lock.

209
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,340
 And at this point you know that Madame Monnier is probably, she's probably so psychotic

210
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,540
 that she probably figured she could still talk her way out of what was about to happen.

211
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,940
 I don't honestly think like she was trying to stop the cops from breaking the lock.

212
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,300
 I'm sure she figured she could explain it away because she's, no one's ever stood up

213
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,420
 against her.

214
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,900
 The only person who stood up against her was Blanche Monnier who went missing at this point

215
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,300
 25 years ago.

216
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,540
 The staff of the house was terrified of her.

217
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,100
 Her son was terrified of her.

218
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,180
 So why would she suspect that the cops wouldn't do what she said?

219
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,940
 But anyways, the cops "chink, chink, shh!" break the padlock.

220
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,660
 Also the ground dramatically in slow motion.

221
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,100
 It's all tumbling.

222
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,540
 "Chink, chink, shh!"

223
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,660
 They opened the door and they were immediately hit with the worst smell possible.

224
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,060
 The cops obviously really were like, it was indescribable, choking.

225
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,460
 You couldn't be in the room for more than a few minutes and they didn't plan on being

226
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
 it.

227
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,220
 The room is pitch black.

228
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,420
 Even with the light coming in from the open door.

229
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,380
 They can't really see what's going on in there.

230
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,580
 But they do see on the far end of the room what appears to be a shuttered window with

231
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,020
 a large black carpet put over it.

232
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,740
 And they're not just using curtains on this one, there's a carpet.

233
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,620
 So the elite cop says, okay, your job, rookie, your job is to go across this dark smelly,

234
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,060
 gross room and smash that window open.

235
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,860
 We're gonna stand outside here, playing in her nose and you have to go do that.

236
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,340
 And the rookie's like, dammit.

237
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,940
 So the rookie goes over there, tears the carpeting down, breaks the window open, sunlight fills

238
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,620
 the room.

239
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,380
 The police see it as littered with food, like rotten, not like yummy, some shit Thanksgiving

240
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,540
 turkey, but just garbage food, half rotten, vermin everywhere, poop.

241
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,740
 They start to see poop, like little pieces of poop.

242
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,260
 And it's not like rabbit poop either.

243
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:36,580
 As they start to take in the room, they realize that it's not just food and rats and feces

244
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,780
 filling up this room.

245
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,940
 There is a 50 year old woman chained to a bed and she goes, it's so nice to see the

246
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,140
 sun again.

247
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:57,500
 Blanche Monnier, when she refused to marry her approved suitor, was dragged upstairs

248
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,700
 by the mother and most likely the staff as well, maybe even her brother, and was chained

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,420
 to the bed.

250
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,100
 And every so often, the mother would go into the room and would say, you've been chained

251
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,660
 up here for a week now, I'm sure your spirit is broken, you're sitting in your own poop,

252
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,140
 honey.

253
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
 Will you marry who I say you want to marry?

254
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,980
 And she said, no.

255
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,540
 Mom would leave the room.

256
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,580
 The mom would periodically come back and say, are you ready now to marry who I said, no,

257
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,580
 mother.

258
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,980
 I'd rather sit here in my poop.

259
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,260
 I have all these friends that are rats from all the food you've given me.

260
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,820
 I'd rather be in here, mom slams the door.

261
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,780
 Even after the lawyer died, even after her true love died, the mother came to her and

262
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,620
 said, he's dead.

263
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,380
 You have no one else.

264
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,780
 Will you mother, I will not marry who you tell me to marry.

265
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,820
 For 25 years.

266
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,700
 There's before and after photos of her.

267
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,340
 She truly was ravishing before this all happened.

268
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,380
 25 years later, she was only 55 pounds.

269
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
 It was a living skeleton.

270
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,300
 So it's not like, again, she was well fed.

271
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,100
 They weren't bringing her up like quiche and foie gras and all that stuff.

272
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,700
 They were bringing her up scraps.

273
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
 She was eating them.

274
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,860
 I don't think all the rats were her friends.

275
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,820
 She probably had to fight a couple of them for a chicken bone.

276
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,060
 So the cops obviously rescued her and took her to the hospital.

277
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,700
 They didn't immediately arrest the mother because the mother's denying it.

278
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,020
 She's probably like, oh my God, I didn't know where you went.

279
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,300
 You must have changed yourself to that bed and brought food to yourself every night.

280
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,380
 The staff again was terrified of the mother, but the police do rescue the young woman,

281
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,740
 rescue Blanche.

282
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,500
 And the townspeople find out about what had happened at this house and in true French

283
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
 fashion.

284
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,380
 The French love to protest everything from Beauty and the Beast to the Yellowjacket protests

285
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
 that are going on right now.

286
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,460
 And I guess the French revolution that happened in between there.

287
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,380
 The French love to just protest and really to chop people's heads off.

288
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,060
 A bunch of townspeople in the nearby town formed a mob and started marching on the house.

289
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,820
 Two days after Blanche was rescued, a mob showed up at the Monier estate and Madame

290
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,620
 Monier seeing this had a heart attack and died.

291
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,460
 Now again, no one had ever stood up to her until her daughter.

292
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,300
 She held everyone in the grasp of fear and afterwards the son was going to get prosecuted

293
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,020
 for the crime.

294
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,500
 His lawyer was like this lawyer, his literal defense was he's mentally retarded and he

295
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,140
 didn't know what was going on, which kind of shouldn't fly because he was also a lawyer.

296
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,060
 So if he was my lawyer, I would go, wait a second, you're mentally retarded?

297
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
 But it did work.

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,940
 He didn't get prosecuted for it.

299
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,580
 The staff all said we were all terrified of her.

300
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,780
 And to be fair, if she's willing to chain her daughter up for 25 years, imagine what

301
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,260
 she'd do to you.

302
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,620
 And the theory is that one of the relatives of the staff wrote the letter to the police.

303
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,860
 And that's how they found out about it.

304
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,460
 Blanche ended up going to a sanitarium where she lived the rest of her days.

305
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:25,820
 They said that she was as mentally stable as a human could be in isolation for 25 years.

306
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,460
 She wasn't out dancing the jig and she didn't go like oh it's 1876, let's go, what's going

307
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
 on in America?

308
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,620
 Oh no, civil war.

309
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,820
 But she also wasn't catatonic.

310
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,500
 So she wasn't super sociable, which you can expect, but she wasn't like, so they put her

311
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,860
 in a sanitarium.

312
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,700
 And that was probably the best place they could put her.

313
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,420
 Don't think they'd change her to anything, but they really couldn't.

314
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,580
 I mean, she just wasn't able to take care of herself at that point.

315
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,780
 And she died in 1913.

316
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,740
 So she had 25 years of vivacious young life under a ruthless mother, but at least she

317
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,180
 had her own life.

318
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,620
 25 years chained up in a pitch black room having chicken bones thrown at you.

319
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,140
 And then 11 years of "freedom."

320
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,060
 Sure, she was in a sanitarium, but she did have, in a sense, the mental freedom.

321
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,660
 Her mother was dead.

322
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,180
 She was free of that tyranny.

323
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,780
 Now the thing is, is that, like I said in the intro, people kill for love, people die

324
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,660
 for love, at what point in 25 years would you say, "Yeah, yeah, just let me out."

325
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,140
 Like I'm sure when she got all super skinny and was 50 years old, the mother still wasn't

326
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,380
 expecting her to go out and land Brad Pitt as a suitor.

327
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,100
 But for that first couple years, like at what point would you, honestly, if someone chained

328
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,740
 me up and said, "You need to go marry this chick who has a lot of money or you can marry

329
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,540
 this girl that you're really in love with."

330
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,460
 I'd give me an hour, I'll be like fine, whatever, I'll marry the other chick, she has money.

331
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,620
 Like I couldn't go a year, I couldn't go 20 years, 25 years, whatever.

332
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,420
 I mean, bizarre, but I guess she really loved that lawyer and especially after he died,

333
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,580
 she continued to stay trapped in there to rather than give in to her mother.

334
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,060
 I will say this one, so this episode's probably gonna run a little long and this is gonna

335
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,460
 be our segue to our personal stories.

336
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,740
 A little bit of a, I guess this story isn't as dramatic as Blanche's story.

337
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,740
 When I was, I'm very strong-willed.

338
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,860
 I especially more so when I was a kid.

339
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,460
 Now I've learned to kind of give and take a little bit.

340
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,380
 When I was a kid, I remember my mom made spaghetti and green beans for dinner and I hated green

341
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,480
 beans and we all sat in the living room eating it, sitting at the little coffee table watching

342
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,220
 whatever was on back in like 1980.

343
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,540
 This would have been like in 1986.

344
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,340
 So I'm sitting there eating my spaghetti and I don't eat my green beans.

345
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,860
 I didn't like green beans, I didn't want to eat them.

346
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,900
 My old brother's eating his spaghetti and green beans.

347
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,380
 My little brother's eating his spaghetti.

348
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,540
 Everyone's eating their spaghetti and green beans.

349
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,060
 But I eat all my spaghetti but don't eat the green beans.

350
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,340
 And for whatever reason my dad made an omission that night, it really made him mad.

351
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,580
 I wasn't eating green beans.

352
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,860
 And I said, "I don't want to eat the green beans."

353
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,940
 And my dad's like, "You're going to eat these green beans."

354
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,660
 And I was like, "Dad, I'm not going to eat these green beans."

355
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,220
 That argument lasted probably two hours.

356
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,540
 Now two hours to a, what did I say it was, an eight year old?

357
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
 I was young.

358
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,620
 It was like seven, eight, nine somewhere around there probably called.

359
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,740
 Two hours is a massive amount of time to a kid.

360
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,940
 And it was funny because I remember both of my brothers kind of being like, "Uh, they

361
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
 got up and left.

362
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,220
 My older brother went to go do homework.

363
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,140
 My little brother went to go play with toys."

364
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,340
 My mom was in the kitchen.

365
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,220
 She was heartbroken because the man that she loved and the son that she loved were having

366
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,540
 this eternal struggle over green beans.

367
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,460
 And we didn't have microwaves back then.

368
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,580
 I refused to eat them.

369
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,820
 My dad's like, "The longer you take to eat these green beans, the colder they're going

370
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,620
 to get, they're going to get even grosser.

371
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,180
 You need to eat these green beans."

372
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,660
 And finally in the end, I didn't eat the green beans.

373
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,260
 Like, after it was about a two hour long fight, I remember just sitting there and my dad's

374
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,220
 sitting there silently and going, "Just eat the green beans."

375
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,580
 And I was like, "I'm not going to eat the green beans."

376
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
 It was this huge fight.

377
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,860
 It wasn't physical.

378
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,900
 My dad was never like that, but it was this battle of the minds, which in the end, I won.

379
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,980
 But oddly enough, I love green beans now all year long.

380
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,100
 I have no problem just making dinner, throw some green beans on, put on some Parmesan cheese

381
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,780
 or some pepper, whatever.

382
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,900
 But yeah, no.

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,140
 So I am a spiritual ally of Blanche.

384
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,260
 Now I can already tell this episode's going to run long, but I don't want to...

385
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,460
 I want to keep pretty much everything I just talked about in, because I think that personal

386
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,780
 green bean story does lead into our next story.

387
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
 And that is...

388
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,900
 Well, I guess it doesn't really, but it's a personal story.

389
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,540
 So this wasn't originally the topic for today, because something happened this morning.

390
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,060
 Now last night when I was going...

391
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,580
 I... all I do...

392
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,700
 People asked me, "Hey, did you hear about this political thing that was going on?"

393
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,780
 Or, "You know, did you hear about..."

394
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,100
 And I was like, "Listen, if it doesn't involve Bigfoot aliens or ghosts, I don't know about

395
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
 it.

396
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,380
 I haven't had time to read, like, in-depth articles on politics or society or culture

397
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
 in months.

398
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,180
 Like, I'll scan the news to keep a little bit updated, but when anyone wants like a

399
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,460
 deep dive into something, I'm like, "Dude, really unless Donald Trump got abducted

400
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,660
 by aliens, I'm really not aware of really what's going on right now.

401
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,220
 All my time has spent researching this stuff and watching...

402
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,940
 Watching Ohmrecker play Dead by Daylet on YouTube.

403
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,660
 That's my one guilty pleasure.

404
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,020
 So last night before I went to bed, I was researching all last night, and the last night

405
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,180
 before I went to bed, I got my book, The National Directory of Haunted Places.

406
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,820
 I've talked about it a ton of times.

407
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,380
 I love the book a lot.

408
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,420
 I'd say 90% of my ghost stories come from that book.

409
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,860
 Really recommend picking it up.

410
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,460
 It's a big book.

411
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
 But I thought, "You know what?

412
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
 Before I go to bed, I'm going to read...

413
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,460
 I can't even take...

414
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,980
 I can't even lay in bed and relax.

415
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
 I go...

416
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,180
 Before I go to bed, I'm going to lay in bed, and I'm going to read My National Directory

417
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,980
 of Haunted Places, and I highlight stories that then I have to do further research on

418
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,540
 and see if there's anything behind it.

419
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,260
 So I grab my book and I start reading it, and it's all stories about like people walking

420
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,260
 through walls and ghosts climbing into beds, and I...

421
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,980
 It's 11 o'clock at night.

422
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,660
 And I'm like, "Uh, maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now.

423
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,620
 This is kind of creepy."

424
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,060
 And I have a giant stick, so when I lay in bed, I can just hit my outlet a couple times

425
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 and it shuts my light off.

426
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,860
 But I'm reading this book and I'm making little X's next to the stories I want to cover.

427
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,180
 And I was laying there and I thought, "You know what?

428
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,100
 It's so funny because I'm reading all of these experiences."

429
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:54,100
 And I go and, you know, like I believe in ghosts in a sense, but where are they?

430
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
 Like really there should be ghosts everywhere.

431
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 Where are they?

432
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
 And then I got a little more creeped out and I was like, "You know what?

433
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,300
 I'm just going to put the book...

434
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
 I'm just stopping reading the book.

435
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,860
 I put the little bookmark in, tossed the book to the side of the bed, shut the light off,

436
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,540
 turned on my phone, did some more research.

437
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,980
 That wasn't going to scare me before I went to bed."

438
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
 I go to work.

439
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,860
 I come home and I have to use the bathroom and I go, "Oh, you know what?

440
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,300
 I need to do some more research.

441
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 I can't even relax in the bathroom."

442
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 I was like, "Oh, I need to do some more research."

443
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,140
 When I'm in the bathroom, where's my book?

444
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,820
 And I go to find it.

445
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
 Gone.

446
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,940
 Now, this isn't a small book.

447
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,460
 It's about the size of a human head.

448
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,940
 Not as thick, but it's not a paperback.

449
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,380
 It's not one of those lame, little paperbacks.

450
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,700
 It's a trade paperback.

451
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
 It's a big, thick book.

452
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,140
 It's about as wide and tall as a human head.

453
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,500
 It's probably like 400 pages.

454
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,860
 And I look over to where I put it and it's gone.

455
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,940
 And I go, "Oh, well, it must have fallen behind the bed."

456
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,820
 And I start to replay in my mind exactly where I put the book.

457
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,780
 And I was like, "I know I didn't get out of bed because I hit the outlet with the stick

458
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,220
 a bunch of times."

459
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,340
 So I go, "Oh, it must have been here."

460
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
 And I look, it's not there.

461
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,100
 Oh, this is kind of a big book to just disappear.

462
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,380
 And at this point, I'm thinking, when I was reading the book, I remembered thinking,

463
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,420
 "Why aren't there any ghosts around?"

464
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,860
 And I'm going to get into where there's ghosts around, but not the type of ghosts that I

465
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,260
 read about in the book.

466
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,660
 I'm thinking, "Ah, you know, because in the book, there's always plates being tossed

467
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,980
 around and dolls moving and creepy stuff like that."

468
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,300
 And so I go, "It must be under this."

469
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,900
 Now my bedroom is messy, but it's not loose a human-sized head book messy.

470
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,540
 It's really not that messy.

471
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,860
 I have a bunch of clothes all over the place and I'm looking around and I go, "Maybe it's

472
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
 under this.

473
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
 Maybe it's under this."

474
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
 I'm digging.

475
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,780
 Now, again, reminder, I have to go to the bathroom.

476
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,100
 I really have to go to the bathroom.

477
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,060
 And I'm feverishly digging for this book.

478
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,260
 At this point, I don't really necessarily need it to read.

479
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,980
 I need to prove to myself that the book is here.

480
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,300
 I can't find it.

481
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
 So I just go to the bathroom.

482
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,620
 I'm like, "Whatever, I don't have the book."

483
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,780
 And it's funny because I was sitting in the bathroom and I thought, "I should ask the

484
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,980
 ghost if he took my book to give it back."

485
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,900
 And I kind of said it as a joke and I was like, "Of course it doesn't work because that's

486
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,060
 not the way ghost stuff works."

487
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,020
 Like I'm some sort of expert, but you know what I mean?

488
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,580
 Like I was just like, "Eh."

489
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,620
 And so I come out and I, at this point, before I went to the bathroom, I spent like 15, 20

490
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,060
 minutes looking for the book and I had lifted everything up off the floor in that area,

491
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,580
 looked behind the bed, looked in place.

492
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,180
 I was thinking maybe I threw the book.

493
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,740
 I was trying to play back in my mind.

494
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,460
 I was like, "Yeah, I remember turning over and setting the book down on a pile of clothes."

495
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,780
 And I had grabbed my phone and hit the light switch.

496
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,380
 I remember that sequence of events.

497
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,300
 So where is the book now?

498
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,060
 But so when I was in the bathroom, I was thinking, "Oh, maybe I should ask it."

499
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,740
 I come out of the bathroom and I'm thinking, "It would be crazy if the book was on the ground."

500
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,380
 And it wasn't.

501
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,700
 But for whatever reason, when I come out of the bathroom, I kind of look on the ground,

502
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,820
 I don't see anything kind of chuckle to myself.

503
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,380
 I turn to my left and you're going to laugh at the first part of this.

504
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:09,180
 I turn to my left where I have a big bookcase full of maybe, I don't know, 50 books.

505
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,420
 And I'm going, "Is it on the bookcase?"

506
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
 And it was.

507
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,060
 It was on the bookcase facing against the wall so I could only see the pages not the

508
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
 spine.

509
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,660
 Now, the rational part of my mind goes, "Okay."

510
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
 And I grabbed the book.

511
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
 I took it out to the living room and started reading it.

512
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,340
 I go, "The rational part of my mind is this.

513
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,460
 I must have at some point either woken up in the middle of the night, slept, walked,

514
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,140
 picked the book up off the pile of clothes and put it in the library facing the wrong

515
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
 way.

516
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,260
 Or when I woke up in the morning to get ready for work, it was in my way and then I picked

517
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,860
 it up and put it in the library."

518
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,780
 That's the rational explanation.

519
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,660
 I do, to debunk, to argue with that, it could have been in my way but so were the three

520
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,380
 big piles of clothes would have been in my way because there was a, there's much clothes

521
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
 there.

522
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,940
 So why would I have picked the book up and put it in the library?

523
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,500
 But for whatever reason it ended up there.

524
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,340
 And the most likely explanation is, "I did it."

525
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:21,020
 I've talked about on past episodes that my apartment's haunted and I kind of said, "I'll

526
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
 talk about it later.

527
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
 I'll talk about it later."

528
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,340
 And when this happened this morning, I thought, "Now's a great time to talk about this.

529
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,420
 Now's a great time to talk about the story."

530
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,220
 When I moved into this apartment, it's a beautiful apartment.

531
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,020
 This place was probably built back in the 1950s.

532
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,620
 So it's a tiny little kitchen, tiny little bedroom, tiny little living room, but it's

533
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,380
 perfect for a bachelor.

534
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
 And it was great.

535
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,420
 Remember when I moved in here, there was obviously no furniture or anything.

536
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,940
 There was just a fridge and oven and stuff like that.

537
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,020
 And the closet door has a padlock on the outside.

538
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,980
 Now I've never seen a closet door with a lock on the outside.

539
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,420
 And to be fair, I don't think I've ever really seen a closet door with a lock.

540
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:09,140
 But it seemed odd that the closet is made to basically lock something into it.

541
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:16,380
 And I thought, again, rational, maybe the door is loose and maybe if you don't lock

542
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,460
 it, the door is always kind of a little open and it's kind of creepy.

543
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
 That's not the case.

544
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
 But that was one of my first nights.

545
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,540
 I thought, "Well, that's weird."

546
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,180
 Why would there be a lock on the outside of it?

547
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,580
 Not a padlock, but it's a little like slide lock on the outside of this closet.

548
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,860
 And the first night I slept on the floor and I just kind of was like, "Oh, this is an awesome

549
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
 place.

550
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,980
 Like, this place is for me."

551
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,460
 It wasn't long after my first night.

552
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,780
 It may have honestly been the second or third night after I had actually moved in.

553
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,540
 Like, it was beginning to move my stuff in.

554
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,540
 And I never saw anything at first.

555
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:56,040
 But I felt there was the presence in my closet.

556
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,980
 And I could describe that it was almost like a visual image that just kind of popped into

557
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
 my head.

558
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
 It could be my imagination.

559
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,860
 Could have been a waking dream.

560
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:14,500
 But I got the image of an elderly man, a maciated elderly man, wearing nothing but underwear

561
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,340
 in my closet.

562
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:23,620
 Now, of course, I used the padlock on my closet, but I just had this horrible vision of this

563
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,660
 elderly man wearing nothing but underwear standing in my closet.

564
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,740
 For a long time, I didn't even sleep in my bedroom because it was really creepy.

565
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,540
 Now there is a, but even when I did, I kept that thing locked.

566
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,180
 There is a shop in Hood River called Sparkling Creations.

567
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,900
 They sell a lot of gems and rocks and healing crystals and stuff like that.

568
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,020
 They also sell sage, which is a thing that you can burn and it's called smudging.

569
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:55,260
 You basically smudge a location and you can purify it and it basically, in mystical terms,

570
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,740
 I mean, there's nothing scientific about this, but you can create a barrier from anything

571
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,300
 getting in basically as a healing thing.

572
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,220
 And I went down there to buy some and it's funny because I've talked about how creepy

573
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,780
 Hood River is in general.

574
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,340
 No one ever really likes to talk about it, but it just kind of is, the town seems a

575
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,140
 little off and I go in there to buy it and I ended up becoming good friends with a bunch

576
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,340
 of people who worked there, but at the time I was just a new guy and I went in there to

577
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
 buy some sage.

578
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,020
 They said, oh yeah, good thing because we sell out so quickly, you're actually buying

579
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
 the last one.

580
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,580
 And I remember coming back later and they're like, oh no, no, no, we're totally out of

581
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
 sage.

582
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,900
 It's something they order and just a ton of people buy.

583
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,060
 They can't keep it in stock.

584
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,420
 So I get this sage.

585
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,220
 I've never smudged before, but I've known about the practice and I went and did some

586
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,980
 research online and they were talking about how to do it and things like that.

587
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,260
 I was like, oh, okay, you know, it seems pretty easy.

588
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,540
 But I had a problem with saging my house.

589
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,260
 Now moving up to Hood River, I had always like, especially when I was younger, I was

590
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,180
 constantly having interactions with ghosts and or demonic activity or whatever it was.

591
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,940
 And so I've been fairly keeping a low profile for a while, not like reading that stuff.

592
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,100
 You know, I'm doing it now and that goes into another story we're going to talk about.

593
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,020
 Yeah, this episode is going to run long.

594
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:15,140
 But I remember thinking, okay, if smudging works, if I'm basically smudging my house

595
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,620
 and I create a barrier around it and if you are a traveling, this sounds completely ridiculous,

596
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,660
 but just go with me on this.

597
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,500
 Let's say I smudge my house and I create a mystical barrier around it that nothing can

598
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,740
 get in.

599
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,900
 And let's say you are a spirit, a dark spirit wandering through the world.

600
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,140
 And you see this house here and that house there and this house here.

601
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,820
 And then you see a small little apartment with a glowing seal around it.

602
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:51,660
 This dark spirit could say, hmm, something special is in there.

603
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,180
 It'd be the equivalent of if you have a safe in your house, people go, oh, you must have

604
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,940
 some important documents or cash or other things in there.

605
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,380
 You could have those same things just in a drawer and no one would ever know they were

606
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
 there.

607
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,180
 But once they see your safe, they go, hmm, interesting.

608
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,580
 It's a pretty big safe.

609
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,500
 Why do you have a safe that big?

610
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,700
 Oh, yeah.

611
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,540
 You know, I just thought maybe I shouldn't smudge.

612
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,300
 Like that was kind of the thought that was going through my head.

613
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,660
 Maybe I shouldn't snudge.

614
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,060
 Maybe it would basically be sending a beacon out saying, hey, don't come in my house.

615
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,860
 But when every time I leave my house, something's like, oh, yeah, you know, come after me.

616
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,460
 Is that fanciful thinking?

617
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
 Absolutely.

618
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
 Absolutely.

619
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,300
 Is there anything realistic about that chain of logic?

620
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
 No.

621
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,540
 But it did keep me from smudging.

622
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,180
 I guess it's logical to me because I believe in ghosts, but you know what I mean?

623
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,580
 Like, I don't let them go, oh, don't eat donuts and I'm like, better not eat this donut.

624
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,420
 Like there are certain areas where I'll be like, maybe this will have some sort of ramification.

625
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,900
 But I didn't smudge.

626
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,380
 But I still had this feeling that this thing was in my closet.

627
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,540
 And people would be like, why don't you try communicating with them?

628
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,180
 I'm like, hell no, dude.

629
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
 Creepy.

630
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,780
 She's going to ignore it.

631
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,580
 Hopefully it ignores me.

632
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,380
 But for whatever reason, maybe about seven, eight months after I had bought the sage,

633
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,940
 I thought, you know what, tomorrow I'm going to sage my house.

634
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,420
 I'm going to do it.

635
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,780
 I mean, it's not going to hurt anything.

636
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,580
 I'm going to sage it.

637
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,620
 Maybe I'm wrong about it sending off some sort of beacon.

638
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,940
 Maybe that's just, I've never heard that in literature before.

639
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
 So I'm just going to do it.

640
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,020
 I will sage my house tomorrow.

641
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,100
 But I was sleeping out on my couch.

642
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,700
 I wasn't sleeping in my living room.

643
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,500
 That night, I woke up in the middle of the night.

644
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:48,260
 Again, any rational, personal thing I was dreaming, even I think I was most likely dreaming.

645
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,180
 But I woke up in the middle of the night sitting in my living room, laying on my couch in my

646
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,060
 living room.

647
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,300
 And the way my living room is set up is there's two doors.

648
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,180
 There's one that leads into the bedroom, which I keep closed when I'm in here.

649
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,220
 And then there's a door frame that leads into the kitchen.

650
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,620
 And there's not a door there.

651
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,820
 So it's just a doorway.

652
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,100
 And I woke up and into the doorway of the kitchen was the old man.

653
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,380
 He was wearing clothes and he stood there and he kind of leaned against the door frame

654
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,340
 with like, on his elbow and his hand was kind of behind his head.

655
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,620
 He was just kind of leaning casually and he goes, "I'm sorry I scared you.

656
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,780
 That wasn't my intent.

657
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,180
 Please don't sage this apartment."

658
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,700
 Disappeared.

659
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
 I still have the sage.

660
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
 I never used it.

661
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,580
 I thought, "That was interesting.

662
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,180
 Was it all possibly in my head?"

663
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
 "Yes."

664
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,380
 "Was the old man in the closet possibly in my head?"

665
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
 "Yes."

666
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,860
 I still keep the closet door locked when I sleep in there.

667
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,620
 But I thought it was just a really interesting chain of events.

668
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,700
 That's not the only haunting I've had in my apartment.

669
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,140
 And that's why in the same apartment, and that's why I think the story episode is going

670
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
 to run a little long.

671
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,660
 I hope you guys don't mind.

672
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,180
 I figured I'd rather just get it all in now than kind of spread it out over episodes,

673
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,700
 just to keep the continuity of it.

674
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,140
 Because there's different time shifts.

675
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
 So that happened when I first moved in here.

676
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,220
 And again, I keep the closet door locked.

677
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,700
 Sometimes I fall asleep and the closet door is open and I don't see like, creepy hands

678
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,540
 reaching out of the closet and the darkness.

679
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
 It's just an open closet.

680
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,820
 Like, sometimes I just pass out because I'm so tired.

681
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,220
 Now probably about two or three years ago.

682
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,900
 And I know that's kind of iffy, but my friend Lana could verify this because she was here

683
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
 for the After Effect.

684
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,540
 But fairly recently, more recent than all of the Sage stuff.

685
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,420
 I'm a big movie watcher.

686
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,140
 When I'm not watching YouTube videos of Dead by Daylight gameplay.

687
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,180
 When I'm not reading a lot of times, especially after I'm done.

688
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,100
 Like as episodes are uploading to YouTube, I'll throw in a movie, watch maybe 10, 15

689
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,220
 minutes of it, move to the next movie, da-da-da-da, until I find something I really like.

690
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,340
 So I came across this movie called Asmodexia.

691
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
 Don't know what it means.

692
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,580
 Don't really want to know what it means.

693
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:09,500
 It was a Spanish horror movie about a grandfather and his granddaughter who were trying to kill

694
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,180
 the Antichrist.

695
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,860
 The devil had impregnated a woman and they were trying to kill the child before it destroyed

696
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
 the planet.

697
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,980
 And it was interesting because there's basically, if I remember correctly, I didn't watch a

698
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,940
 lot of it and it's been a while, there's basically three parallel stories.

699
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,260
 There was the grandfather and granddaughter and I think it starts off with them killing

700
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,100
 a baby, killing a mother and a baby.

701
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,460
 We have a reporter who's going undercover into a mental asylum to expose the bad stuff

702
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,300
 that's going on there and then you had a mentally insane woman who claims she was raped by the

703
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,420
 devil.

704
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,540
 And I remember the most interesting part of the movie narratively was the devil was saying,

705
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,580
 it was this handsome young man, he goes, "They're trying to kill my child but what they don't

706
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,980
 know is that I've impregnated like 600 women.

707
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,220
 They can never stop this.

708
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,340
 They think they're trying to hunt down the one true.

709
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,860
 They think they already beat me because they killed that one woman I impregnated.

710
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,580
 I'm just impregnating hundreds of them.

711
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,260
 They can't stop me."

712
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,900
 And it was a really intriguing movie and I wanted to finish watching it.

713
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,260
 But what happened was, I'm sitting there watching it.

714
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:20,140
 I'm still in my living room and I hear maybe probably about 10 feet away from me.

715
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,780
 I had a table set up and I had some stuff on the table and some stuff on the ground.

716
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,540
 My living room tends to be a little more clean than my bedroom.

717
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,660
 I'm watching this movie and I'm like, "Man, this movie is really good."

718
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,160
 But it was really creepy.

719
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,980
 There was something about the movie that was just kind of really creepy to me.

720
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
 I'm watching it.

721
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,940
 Middle, it's probably like four in the afternoon.

722
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,300
 I hear this, "BAM!"

723
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:47,380
 Now I can't make the noise loud enough on the podcast, but it was the equivalent of

724
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,780
 someone dropping 60 pounds of bricks on the ground.

725
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,660
 It was this massive noise.

726
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:01,980
 And I immediately turned to my left and I'm thinking a computer fell over or the table

727
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,740
 collapsed or something.

728
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,900
 Maybe not 60 pounds, but it sounded like it's 60 pounds to put a hole through the floor.

729
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,420
 It was loud enough that I thought something huge happened over there.

730
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,980
 And so I turn and I look and everything's on the table, nothing's on the ground.

731
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,660
 And I'm thinking, "Okay, it could just have fallen."

732
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,120
 And I'm not seeing it and I'm just staring over there in that corner and there is nothing

733
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,220
 heavy on the ground at all.

734
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,500
 A couple pieces of clothing.

735
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:35,780
 And I remember just staring over at that area and I'm thinking, "What the hell?

736
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,540
 But then it come from outside, it came from, I'd say five feet away from me now that I'm

737
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
 looking over there.

738
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,060
 I'd say about five feet, because I recorded in my living room, about five feet from where

739
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
 I'm sitting right now.

740
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,820
 I heard that huge noise and the movie's still playing.

741
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,460
 And I'm thinking, "It was weird.

742
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,820
 Something in me said, shut the movie off, dude.

743
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
 Just shut the movie off."

744
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,620
 And I was like, "Nah, nah, that's just a coincidence, man.

745
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,980
 It must just be like somebody must have dropped something.

746
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,580
 Someone maybe threw something downstairs.

747
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,860
 Maybe it did come from outside.

748
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,660
 It has nothing to do with the movie.

749
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,460
 But something was telling me, "Shut the movie off, man.

750
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,740
 This movie's way too creepy."

751
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,260
 I watched maybe five more minutes of the movie.

752
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,980
 Now it was, like I said, about four in the afternoon, but my ceiling light was on and

753
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,980
 the light goes, "Doo."

754
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,020
 Doesn't make that noise.

755
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,700
 But it burns out, but not in that "psshh," where it burns out.

756
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:38,140
 It goes from being fully lit and there was a slight noise and then it just slowly faded

757
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,820
 out.

758
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,100
 And I got up and I shut the movie off.

759
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,940
 I was like, "Ah, I'm done with this movie.

760
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,380
 Done with this movie."

761
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:53,980
 I remember then to wrap that story up, my ceiling's too high for me to reach anything.

762
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,020
 I don't have a ladder, so I had Lana come over and I was like, "Hey, can you help me

763
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
 change my light bulb?"

764
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,100
 Because she's tiny, but she could climb on the furniture.

765
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,580
 I couldn't climb on any of my furniture.

766
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,820
 I was like, "Shrek back then."

767
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
 I was like, "350.

768
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,100
 I would have smashed anything I stood on top of."

769
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,260
 So we move the chair around and she gets up on the chair and she's--I'm looking up

770
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,060
 right at the bulb and she kind of is looking down because she's smarter than I am.

771
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,500
 She simply touches the light bulb and I'm looking right at it.

772
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,260
 It turns to dust.

773
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,460
 Just completely just--it was one of those CFL bulbs, you know, like the little wire

774
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
 one.

775
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,580
 But that's how those bulbs normally burn out.

776
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,500
 I'm pretty sure they don't die like that.

777
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,940
 And I'm almost 100% sure they don't turn to dust when you touch them.

778
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,580
 Was all of that connected to that creepy movie I was watching in an apartment that is possibly

779
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
 haunted?

780
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,140
 The skeptical side of me says it's a series of coincidences.

781
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,700
 You were moving into a new place, so you imagined this force in your place and then when you

782
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,180
 started to feel more welcome in your house, this made up imaginary thing welcomed you

783
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,060
 into the house, that the noise that I heard may have even been connected to the reason

784
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
 why the light went out.

785
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,900
 I could have been watching teletubbies and the same sequence of events could have happened.

786
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,380
 The noise could have--was most likely not a hallucination, but was a noise emanating

787
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,300
 from somewhere else.

788
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,700
 And the light bulb was just timing.

789
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,260
 The book, missing?

790
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,540
 People move stuff around all the time.

791
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,260
 You're not known to sleepwalk, but people do weird stuff in their sleep.

792
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,180
 You may have woken up and half awake, stepped on the book, picked it up, moved it.

793
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,500
 These are rational explanations for this stuff.

794
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,140
 And this story, this last story I'm going to finish with, has a rational explanation as

795
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
 well.

796
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:48,620
 But it goes back to what I was saying that when I was younger and I read more about ghosts

797
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,020
 and stuff like that, I felt like I had more paranormal activity in my life.

798
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:59,580
 And then in my mid-20s to mid-30s, I was more focused on music and wasn't reading so much

799
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,780
 ghost stuff.

800
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,220
 But then I started doing this podcast.

801
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,940
 I was probably--this probably would have happened--started happening around late October.

802
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,220
 It's hard for me to put a time on it because it just simply started.

803
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,340
 But I'd been doing the podcast at that point for a couple months.

804
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,700
 I was stressed out about stuff, not necessarily podcast stuff, just life in general.

805
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,420
 Not so stressed out that I was like freaking out, but just general stress.

806
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,100
 And I was sitting in my recliner, which is where I record my podcast, which is where

807
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,340
 I go home to relax.

808
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,420
 And on the couch, again, this is one of those things that I can't say that I exactly looked

809
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,540
 over and saw this thing.

810
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,300
 I more felt it to a point that I could perfectly describe it to you.

811
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,500
 So it's like seeing it without seeing it with your eyes, which again, a skeptic would say,

812
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,620
 "That's what imagination is."

813
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,060
 I'm sitting in my recliner.

814
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,580
 And for whatever reason, I turn to my left.

815
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,980
 Something impels me to turn to my left.

816
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,020
 There is a purple man sitting on my couch.

817
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,580
 Now not purple in the sense that he looks like a carabare.

818
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,780
 He's purple because it's a corpse who apparently has been strangled.

819
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,700
 Now what's weird is that there wasn't anything like a big rope around its neck or he was

820
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:28,060
 like, "Ugh, I just had this feeling that there was a very, very obese bald man whose skin

821
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:35,460
 was modeled because he was dead for so long and the blood was pooling under his skin.

822
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,580
 Sitting on my couch.

823
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,700
 I didn't see it.

824
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,860
 I never looked over and actually saw it.

825
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
 But I sensed it.

826
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,340
 I guess there's a better word for it.

827
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,580
 I sensed this presence and never moved.

828
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,020
 Well, it moved like it wasn't there all day long.

829
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,940
 I wasn't like coming home from work and he's, "Ugh!"

830
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,260
 Sometimes he'd be there, sometimes he wouldn't.

831
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,900
 More likely than not, he wouldn't be there.

832
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,620
 But sometimes he'd be over sitting on my couch.

833
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,140
 When it see it, it wasn't an hallucination.

834
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,460
 I just had this sense of it.

835
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,020
 And at first, when I first had that sense, it really, really startled me, obviously.

836
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,660
 And I thought, "Maybe it's because I'm now reading all these ghost stories and really

837
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,260
 looking at this paranormal stuff again.

838
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,220
 I'm able to see this stuff better."

839
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,460
 I think the most likely answer for that one is the stress I was going through because

840
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:30,260
 I'm launching, I've been doing this show for a couple months, but it can get a little stressful,

841
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:36,620
 but not overly stressful, but that daily schedule on top of other life stressors was actually

842
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:43,340
 stressing me out to the point where my mind was just letting off a little bit of steam.

843
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,140
 And that was the result of it.

844
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,860
 Because I was already feeling uncomfortable with what was going on with all these changes

845
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,380
 in my life, good and bad, that I was creating this image to represent that.

846
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:06,100
 So I mean, obviously the other option is that I was looking at a dead man, a ghost.

847
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:12,300
 The interesting thing about ghosts in particular, because sometimes with you have it in Big

848
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,460
 Foot and sometimes you have it in UFOs, but the most interesting thing about ghosts to

849
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:25,540
 me is that they almost always do things that can happen naturally.

850
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,220
 You will have people say, "Oh no, I had this bookshelf and it tipped over."

851
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,940
 Or, "I heard this loud noise in my room and a couple minutes later a light bulb burned

852
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,940
 out."

853
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,220
 Those things happen naturally.

854
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:44,100
 Doors opening, lights shutting off, faucets leaking water, moans in a house.

855
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,220
 These are all things that void of any paranormal explanation.

856
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,980
 Houses will settle, electricity will go out, faucets will be faulty.

857
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:59,100
 They never walk into a room and your refrigerator is hanging upside down.

858
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,580
 You may go sometimes my refrigerator works, sometimes it doesn't, it might be a ghost,

859
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,900
 but it's almost always stuff that can be explained.

860
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,820
 There are a few cases where people have run up walls or heads have twisted around or stuff

861
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,100
 that bones have broken in odd angles.

862
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,180
 I guess all those can probably be explained as well, except for the head twisting around.

863
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,140
 But you can run up a wall and stuff like that.

864
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,420
 Those generally are like it's a light in the sky or it's an alien aircraft, it could be

865
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,580
 one of those bigfoot, it's either bigfoot or another sort of animal.

866
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,660
 But when you talk about ghosts they're so varied.

867
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,980
 Sometimes it's a floating head down the hallway, sometimes it's voices, sometimes it's a sensation

868
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,860
 of being choked, sometimes it's an old man in the closet, purple man on your couch, noises

869
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,020
 and light bulbs going out.

870
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:52,460
 But they still all are things that can easily be explained and that's always the question

871
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,720
 for me with ghosts.

872
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,500
 Everything that I explained to you very likely has a rational explanation.

873
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:06,220
 Very very likely I was stressed out, I moved into a new place, I was watching a movie that

874
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,260
 was already creepy and there was two coincidences that happened and I woke up at some point

875
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,420
 and moved that book to the bookcase which is where a book should be in the first place.

876
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,740
 Those all have very rational explanations.

877
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,860
 But even with those rational explanations, I think I'm probably going to sleep with

878
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,260
 a light on tonight.
