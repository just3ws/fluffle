1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
 A bizarre and very unhygienic satanic ritual.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:11,600
 And then we take a look at the Octavius, a boat found floating all alone off the coast of Greenland.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,300
 What secrets did it hold?

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,400
 And was anyone alive on it after it had been missing for 13 years?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,900
 [Music]

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,100
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,600
 We're gonna slide right into it.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 Get on our surfboards and slide.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
 That's from now on. That's my new intro.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 That's my new character. His name's Johnny Surfer.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 And he'll be showing up at the beginning of each episode.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,100
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,600
 Totally tubular!

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
 So the other day I was on 4chan.

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,600
 Came across the post on the paranormal board.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
 Our buttholes paranormal.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 And people ask, "Hey man, how come you don't go?

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,100
 How come you don't cover stuff on 4chan anymore?"

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
 Because this is the best thing I could find.

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
 Up the past week.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,100
 Our buttholes paranormal.

26
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,100
 Oh, first off, my mom started listening to this podcast.

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,600
 Don't listen to this part.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,100
 Have a good weekend mom. Don't listen to this one.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,100
 So anyways, our buttholes paranormal.

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
 Now of course me, me, and me, I go.

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
 Well of course not. However, or better yet,

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
 of course not. But...

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,100
 And so of course I had to research it, right?

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,600
 Our buttholes paranormal. Now it's funny because I've actually covered that.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 Like an episode 60 or 70 or something like that a long time ago.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 Is the all-c and I on the back of money,

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 the dollar bill actually a butthole.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 Is the all-c and I actually a magical butthole.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 So I've covered buttholes before.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 And I'm looking into this.

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 Now I come across this thing called the

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
 the oscalume in fame.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 Oscalume in fame.

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
 Now I'm sure there's a big butthole kisser out there

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 who realizes I'm mispronouncing that.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
 He's like, "You're mispronouncing that, sir?"

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 Blah blah blah. He goes back to licking a butthole.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 But I'm most likely a mispronouncing that.

49
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
 What it is, it's a Latin.

50
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 And it's this old, timey thing.

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 So back when they're doing the witch trials in Europe, right?

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 They're grabbing a witch, beat her up, be like,

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 "Tell us about your magical powers."

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
 They don't have any puncher in the stomach,

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 tire hands up puncher in the stomach.

56
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
 Like a Rocky movie apparently.

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 They didn't actually murder these people.

58
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 I imagine that they were making them do musical montages

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 until they revealed their secrets.

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 But no, throughout this torture, as there were tortures

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 in these women, every single account of witches,

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 every single witch that was caught during the witch hunts

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 of the European--

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
 according to Wikipedia at least,

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
 every single witch trial talked about oscalume in fame.

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 And what that is, is kissing the devil's butthole.

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 So to get your magical powers,

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
 slash to become, like, loved by Satan,

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 or to fall in love with Satan?

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 I'm kind of confused on that.

71
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 Anyways, because according--

72
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
 in this sentence on Wikipedia it says,

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 "According to folklore, it was this kiss

74
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
 that allowed the devil to seduce women."

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 If you're already kissing my butthole,

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
 I think the seduction part is over.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 I think we're well past that.

78
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 You're never like, "Hey, can I buy you a drink?"

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 "Whoa, lady, what are you doing?"

80
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 You know, like, usually kisses the butthole later on.

81
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 But anyways, so I don't think this is how Satan seals the deal.

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 I think this is way after that sentence.

83
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
 Anyways, a witch had to kiss the devil's butthole.

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 Now it's funny, because again, on Wikipedia,

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 you're like, "Jason, you did a lot of research on this one,

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 didn't you?" I was like, "Thank you, I did."

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 There is a wood carving of a woman--

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 like, an old-timey wood carving from 1608

89
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 of a woman kissing the devil's butthole.

90
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 I was like, "That's--"

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 And it looks like she's grabbing something, actually.

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 Let me take another look at those here.

93
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 Well, she might be holding a really long stick

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 that happens to be right between the devil's legs,

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
 but yeah, she's holding a torch, actually,

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 because the other people are holding torches as well.

97
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 What's so funny, though, is she is kissing the devil's butthole

98
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
 in this old-- I'm gonna use this as the cover-up for this episode.

99
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 She's kissing the devil's butthole, right?

100
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 There's a bunch of townspeople standing behind her,

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 like, just kind of standing there,

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,600
 and the devil has just a hint of a smile on his face.

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
 The devil actually looks like-- did you ever see that movie

104
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
 about the girl who finds the Loch Ness monster

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 and she raises in her bathtub as like the legend of Lily Gup

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 or Puttlefoot or something like that?

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 That's what this devil looks like.

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 He has a weird-looking little devil face.

109
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
 But anyway, she's licking his butthole.

110
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 So, I'm reading that, and I was like, "Oh, that's really interesting.

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
 There's not a lot of stuff to it."

112
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 I mean, that's basically it.

113
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 Like, they would arrest a witch and they'd be like,

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 "Did you lick the butthole?"

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 Did you lick the butthole?

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 And she'd be like, "Yes, yes, I licked the butthole.

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry."

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 And then they're like, "Oh, then that was easy.

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 I could become a witch interrogator if it's that easy."

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 But anyways, gotta lick the butthole.

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
 And you get powers or the devil likes you more,

122
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 that's how the devil seals a deal.

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
 And then this kind of went on.

124
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
 And then some people say, "Well, of course I'm afraid of that."

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
 Wikipedia says that sometimes you'd have to kiss the buttholes

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 of just random demons.

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
 That's like when you go to sleep with Jay-Z,

128
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
 but you end up hooking up with Memphis Bleak instead.

129
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 Like, you're trying to get to the king,

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 but you know, you got a lieutenant, that's not too bad.

131
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
 Sometimes you're not gonna have to kiss the devil's butthole.

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 He'll turn into like a ram and you have to kiss the ram's butthole.

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 Or a frog's butthole. Which to be fair,

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 I wasn't 100% for sure that frogs have buttholes.

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
 I'm pretty sure everything does.

136
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 And like everything alive rocks don't.

137
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
 I guess a volcano is the earth's butthole.

138
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
 But everything has a butthole, so you kiss the frog's butthole.

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 I think that that was a fake.

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 I think that part was some guy who really liked kissing frog buttholes.

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 Goes, "Oh, no, no, sometimes the devil's this frog."

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 [Makes a sound of a frog]

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 See, look at him. Hail Satan.

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 So I think that he had...

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
 Why would Satan become a frog out of all the animals?

146
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 Like, I get it a ram, a cat, a black cat, a toad?

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 What?

148
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 Lame, dude. You think you'd be like a lion or something?

149
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
 Or an alligator.

150
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 Kiss an alligator's butthole.

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
 Show him what you love. How much you love Satan.

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
 So, reading that, I'm clicking on stuff.

153
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
 I'm on Wikipedia. I'm clicking on stuff, right?

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 And then I get to... This is where you really want to shut off, mom.

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 I know she's already shut off.

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 And actually, I should say anyone else who is eating anything

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 might want to shut it off.

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
 Fast forward a couple minutes.

159
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 Or if you're at work, if you work anywhere,

160
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 if anyone else can hear this next part, you might want to skip ahead.

161
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
 We're going to talk about anal lengas.

162
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 Now, I'm not a butt dude.

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 Like, I like the shape of a butt.

164
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 I like a butt in thighs. I like that.

165
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
 But I'm not down with the butthole.

166
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
 I don't do butthole stuff at all.

167
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 I never have. I'm not into it.

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
 Sorry. I'm not... Actually, no, I'm not sorry.

169
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 If you're doing it, that's totally cool.

170
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 But I want to guarantee you, after I read you parts of this,

171
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 you're probably not gonna... You're probably going to reconsider it.

172
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 First off, I did not know this.

173
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 This is related to butt... It's basically becoming butthole facts at this point.

174
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 If you have oral sex, because it's considered...

175
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
 Oh, sorry. We're not just talking about anal sex.

176
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 We're talking about oral sex on the butthole.

177
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,600
 I'm sorry, guys. Okay, let me get through this.

178
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 If you have oral sex with more than five people in your lifetime,

179
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 you have an increased 250% chance of getting throat cancer.

180
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
 That's worse than...

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 There needs to be... Like, when you're picking up someone,

182
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 everyone should have to wear underwear with the little surgeon general

183
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 warning on it, saying...

184
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 "Warning. If you go down on more than five people in..."

185
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 I did not know that. I did not know that at all.

186
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 More than five people in your lifetime?

187
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 That's ridiculous. That is absolutely ridiculous.

188
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
 Anyways, I'm a little concerned.

189
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 Five people in your life.

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
 But that's not what we're talking about.

191
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
 So we're gonna talk about this.

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
 So, going from licking the devil's butthole to just buttholes in general,

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 it's super, super, like, dirty.

194
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 Obviously, right? You're like, "Jason, what is the point of this segment?"

195
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 The point of this segment is, for one,

196
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 I think it's funny that people lick the devil's butthole,

197
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 but two, okay, I'm gonna skip all the other butthole facts.

198
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 I'm gonna get down to this one main thing,

199
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 'cause it's just hilarious to me, and then we'll move on to a story,

200
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 an actual story.

201
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 Apparently, yes, licking a butthole is bad for you.

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 I'm sure that you knew that.

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 You can get all sorts of parasites and diseases.

204
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 You can get HPV, which is what can cause throat cancer.

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 You can get a gastro...

206
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
 You know, it's one of those things.

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,600
 I've obviously, if you're with someone and they have a sexually transmitted disease,

208
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 my question always is, how did you get it?

209
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 Now, that sounds awfully rude,

210
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,600
 and to some of you, you may go, "It doesn't matter how they got it."

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
 But to me, it does. It's the same thing.

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
 If someone's in jail, you go, "What are you in jail for?"

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 They're like, "Robin of Bank." You're like, "Oh, that's cool."

214
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 If they're like, "Oh, I was like, ran a fight club where it was me versus a cat."

215
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 You'd be like, "Oh, that's kind of weird, bro."

216
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 So, if I'm with someone and she goes, "Well, you know, I have like HPV or something like that."

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 I'm gonna go, "How did you get it?"

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 Because they may go, "Oh, I was having like sex in a public restroom for like weeks on end.

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 I didn't sleep. I just stayed in there."

220
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
 I'd be like, "Oh, that's totally gross."

221
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 But if they're like, "Well, you know, I was part of like a research team

222
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 and we went to this continent. We went to the lost continent.

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 I was there with the rock in Kevin Hart.

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 It was at the journey to the center of the earth.

225
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 And there was a giant cat there that had HP infected claws.

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 "WOW!" And cut me. And then I'm cool with that.

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 Like, okay, we can sleep together. It depends.

228
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 I don't have HPV by the way, but I'm saying it depends on how you get it.

229
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 If you get any of these diseases, because you're looking at a butthole,

230
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
 that's a deal breaker. I'm sorry.

231
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 But this is the...

232
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 Hey, I'm almost done.

233
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
 I'm almost...

234
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 I'm almost done here. I'm sorry.

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 I just found this so funny.

236
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 Also, this is gross.

237
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 If you eat meat and it's undercooked and you get parasites,

238
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 then the person looking your butt will get parasites.

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 That's not the funny part. That's not the funny part though.

240
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 So, I've probably built it up so much.

241
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 I'm gonna read this to you.

242
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
 "If the receiving partner..."

243
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 Do not stop eating right now.

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 Stop eating right now. This is in the prevention section.

245
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 "If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on the genitals,

246
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 or if the giving partner, i.e. the person looking the butt hole,

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 has wounds or open sores on or in the mouth,

248
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 or bleeding gums..."

249
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 This poses an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections."

250
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
 Makes sense.

251
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 You got a bleeding butt hole?

252
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 I got bleeding gums. We're gonna have problems.

253
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 Then we go to this part.

254
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 "Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work..."

255
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 So, as you're having braces put in,

256
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 you see a hot butt hole walk by, you're like,

257
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 "Sorry, doc. Gotta go to business."

258
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 Undergoing dental work?

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 Like...

260
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 So, it's not just that you've had dental work.

261
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 You're in the process of having a bridge put in or something like that.

262
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 You're like, "Move out of the way, guys. Gotta lick that butt hole."

263
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 Knockin' over the antithesis.

264
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
 Okay. "Brushing the teeth, flossing..."

265
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 You're flossing...

266
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 Mmm, look at that butt hole.

267
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
 "Brushing the teeth, flossing, which is stuff you should do,

268
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 no matter how much you enjoy eating buttholes."

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 You need to do this stuff.

270
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Undergoing dental work.

271
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 And...

272
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 Eating crunchy foods.

273
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
 And then it has in parentheses.

274
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
 It has in parentheses.

275
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
 Such as potato chips.

276
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 Relatively soon, before or after performing analengus also increases the risk of transmission.

277
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 How did they figure out the potato chip part?

278
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 Like, there must have been at some point a laboratory study done,

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 where they're like, "Okay, we're gonna do a blind study. Everyone's gonna lick a butt hole."

280
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 And then everyone's going to eat...

281
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 You're not gonna eat anything. You're the control group.

282
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 And the guy's like, "What? You? You're gonna eat gummy bears."

283
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 They're like, "Well, can you go back to the part where I'm licking the butt hole?"

284
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 And they're like, "No, no, no. You, you're going to eat some soup."

285
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
 And they're like, "After eating a butt hole," and they go to the next guy,

286
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 "You're gonna eat some potato chips, and then you're gonna eat some peanut brittle."

287
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 And then they get like harder and coarser food.

288
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 And the scientists are sitting there looking there like,

289
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 "The study is, how crunchy does a food have to be before you shouldn't lick a butt hole?"

290
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 And the scientists are sitting there watching that.

291
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Everyone's just kind of confused in the laboratory.

292
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
 They're like, "Did they just say we gotta lick buttholes and then eat food?"

293
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 Taking notes. How do they figure that out? Why? Why potato chips?

294
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 That's so funny, because that's not... I do not believe...

295
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 I will not believe for one moment that that is some example someone pulled out of the air.

296
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 I believe someone says, you know, my cousin in college, he got HPV all up in his gum line.

297
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 They're like, "What?" He's like, "Yeah, ate a butt hole, then ate some potato chips shortly afterwards."

298
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 That's not a random example. That's not a random example.

299
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 We have an issue with people eating buttholes and then eating potato chips, and it's a national tragedy.

300
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 And it may even be a conspiracy.

301
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 So I can fit it into this episode.

302
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 So there you go, butthole eating facts.

303
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 The devil's butthole is... Don't kiss the devil's butthole is the moral of that story.

304
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 Two, don't eat potato chips shortly before or after eating a butthole.

305
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 I understand the after, because you can plan for it. You're like, "Hmm, all done."

306
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 Doing that disgusting sex act.

307
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 Oh, wait, and then you put the chips down.

308
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 But before, you have to... You basically don't ever eat potato chips again,

309
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 because you might be like eating some like Pringles and be like, "I can't eat just one."

310
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 And then like a hot butthole walks by, and you're like, "Ah, man's gotta do what a man's gotta do."

311
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 So anyway, or the moral of the story is to do what I do. Just stay away from butts.

312
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,600
 Stay away from butts. I don't like butts. I know people are really into buttholes and stuff like that.

313
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 I'm approved as far as that goes. I don't do the butt stuff.

314
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 Let's go ahead though. Let's do a boat. Let's do some boat stuff. How's that for a transition?

315
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,600
 So we're leaving behind the butts. We're hopping on some boats. One boat in particular.

316
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 We're gonna hop on a boat, and we're going to go sailing around Greenland.

317
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,600
 So let's hop. Do we have a... Do we have a galleon? I think we just have the Dead Ravaropa.

318
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
 So we're hopping into the Dead Ravaropa. You take some mores. I take some mores.

319
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,600
 Stroke. Stroke. I'm yelling. You go, "You shouldn't be saying that word."

320
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 After our last segment, I'm like, "Nah, nah, nah. I'm not into butt stuff. Don't worry about it."

321
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,600
 Plus, I love eating potato chips. Then you realize I'm on keto, and I haven't eaten potato chips in a long time.

322
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 You look over your shoulder at me, and I'm just staring straight ahead. Stroke.

323
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 We're going all the way up to Greenland. We're going back to the year 1775.

324
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 And we see another boat, another big actual boat, kind of sailing through the water.

325
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 And we're like, "Ahoy, mateys!" And the pirates are like, "Oh, yeah, we don't talk like that anymore."

326
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 In 1775, we talked like normal people. We're like, "Oh, okay."

327
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 So we climb up on their boat, and we jump on board, and we're like, "Nice to meet you. I'm Jason, and this is..."

328
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 You're supposed to say your name whenever I pause like that for new listeners.

329
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 And the captain goes, "Ah, it's nice to meet you guys." So, here's what's going on.

330
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 You see what's over there, sir. Now he sounds like a pirate for some reason. He's like, "Sorry, sorry."

331
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 And he goes, "You see what's over there, guys?" And we look. We see a boat kind of floating amongst the icebergs.

332
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 We're like, "Yeah, what is that?" He goes, "Ah, mateys, it's a boat!"

333
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 It is a boat. It's one of the Davy Jones' boats. This guy obviously has some sort of multiple personality issues.

334
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 So we're like, "We're gonna go over there." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, we'll go over there." So we sail over to this boat.

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 Now, let's jump on board of this abandoned boat. Well, you don't know it's abandoned yet. Sorry, spoiler alert.

336
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 We jump on board this boat, and I go, "Looks abandoned." And you're like, "Yeah, yeah, figured that, 'cause you already said that."

337
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 And we ruin the surprise we're walking around. Now, it's a boat, and it's in relatively good condition.

338
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 But there's no one on the deck. No swabbies, no landlubbers, nothing. So we walk underneath into the boat's hold.

339
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 And we see a little captain's chamber, a little room that has a door. There's multiple rooms and doors on this,

340
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,600
 and there's no one has a sign that says "Captain." So I go, "No, I'll let you open the door." So you grab the knob,

341
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 and you get a big old splinter, and I'm like, "I knew that was gonna happen." You turn the knob,

342
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 and the door opens up. Now, I'm assuming it's pretty dark in this room, 'cause there ain't no candles running.

343
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
 And there's no sun up in Greenland, so it's just super dark. So we're walking in this cabin. We have little flashlights.

344
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 The British call them. Walking around. And we see a man slumped at a desk, and we're like, "Oh, dope. Here's a dude.

345
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 Hey, sir, maybe you can tell us what happened here." We go up, we touch him on the shoulder. "Dude, dude, dude."

346
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 Do that for about seven, eight minutes? He doesn't respond, and then finally I'm like, "Ah, this guy's kinda rude.

347
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 Let's go find someone else." And you're like, "No, no, no, no, no. Jason." I think he's... I think he's dead.

348
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Not only do I think he's dead, I think he's frozen. Dun, dun, dun.

349
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,600
 So it's the captain. Does that make sense? He's in the captain's chambers. And he was writing in his log, and he froze in place while he was writing.

350
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,600
 This was his last entry. 11th November, 1762.

351
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 We have now been enclosed in the ice 70 days. The fire went out yesterday, and our master has been trying ever since to kindle it again.

352
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 Without success. Sorry, I forgot. I forgot there was more to that sentence.

353
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,600
 And our master has been trying ever since to kindle it again without success.

354
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 His wife died yesterday. There is not relief. Dot, dot, dot.

355
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 Now, that log was from 1762. We're now in the year 1775, so it's 13 years after this guy froze to death writing this book.

356
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 And we're looking at it, and we just hear the sounds of the ocean.

357
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 We're beating across this boat that has been sailing for 13 years.

358
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 So we're like, we better investigate this. This is now CSI, crime scene icebergs.

359
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 So we put on our glasses, whatever. We're not following that joke up at all. We just walked into the next room silently, because that was stupid.

360
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 Oh, no. Crag scene investigations, because like icebergs are all craggy.

361
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 Oh, yeah, see back on top now, like hitting you with my elbow. You like that one? Crag scene. You're like chasing that.

362
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 It's just, that might have been worse. Anyways, we go into the next room, as I'm still elbowing you to the side. Come on, man, that joke was funny.

363
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 Next cabin, body of a frozen woman. Blech, just dead. We're like, that must be the wife that was previously mentioned in the journal.

364
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 We see a man trying to light a fire, like mid, like little match. The fire wasn't frozen. It's not like it was blue fire frozen in time, but like you could tell he was trying to catch something on fire.

365
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 It's frozen, sitting on the floor. And then the rest of that we go, or like, I might as well check out the rest of this place.

366
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 Maybe we'll find something cool, eat some popsicles. We start walking through. Every person has, we go into everyone's bedroom. They're dead.

367
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 And then we see a little dog frozen in place at the bottom of the stairs. We're like, oh, okay, well that was a grim end to this boat.

368
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:50,600
 Now this boat was known as the Octavius. We go back up, we find that out at some point. We go back to the captain and we get the captain's log.

369
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 Now, because everything was frozen, some of the pages were frozen together, so it's not like we could go through, but we did have access to the first page and the last page.

370
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 So we're like, take it off the captain, break it out of his hands. We're like, this is our book now, captain. This is our book now.

371
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 We just walk away. I don't know. I can't think of anything. We just walk away.

372
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 And personally, what I would do is I would set the boat on fire in real life. I'd set the boat on fire and they just let everyone burn and melt.

373
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,600
 And be like, go to the sea, my friends, because if I was frozen for 13 years, I would want to be set on fire.

374
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 And if I was on fire for 13 years, I would enjoy a cool glass of ice water. So I figure it would work both ways. But anyways, that's not what they do.

375
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 Well, actually, this is where the story gets interesting. All that stuff is interesting, obviously, that I think so. But this is where it gets interesting.

376
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,600
 So you do have this boat. Now, do you salvage the boat? Do you throw a bunch of hooks on the boat? Actually, that's not what they do. That's not how they salvage a boat.

377
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 You put a crew on the boat and you have that boat be sailed back. Do you try towing it back? Whatever. Do you sink it? Scuttle it? Whatever.

378
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 We don't know because there's a lot of questions of whether or not this incident actually even happened.

379
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 Because this story had been going around since 1828. So we originally hear about it in 1775, or it takes place in 1775. The first time it gets reported to be telling.

380
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 So in publishing was 1828. And there was no ships listed as-- like there were no ships named. It was just like, this one ship found this other ship in the middle of nowhere.

381
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:41,600
 And that was in the magazine or the Gazette. It was called The Aerial, a literary and critical Gazette. It was just like this little section saying, "Once a boat was found--"

382
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 Oh, I guess I should say this too. The idea is that the boat was basically totally encased in an iceberg. Totally skip that detail.

383
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,600
 I was going to go back to after the journal part. The idea is this. The boat was sailing up in Greenland and it got completely frozen.

384
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 It got encased in ice. It got trapped in ice and then got frozen over somehow. And I don't think it was like if they were inside the iceberg.

385
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:17,600
 Like if someone went by-- no, actually, now that I think about it, that was supposedly what it was. Like an iceberg grew over them and they froze in place.

386
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 And then as the environment warmed, the iceberg started to melt and then the boat started sailing again.

387
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,600
 So you could have driven right by this iceberg and seen people frozen inside going like, "Help!" Frozen, except they were all asleep and dying in their beds.

388
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 But that's the idea that this boat was caught in an iceberg and it floated around for 13 years and that's why it wasn't all rotted and stuff like that.

389
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 It wasn't just like floating around. It was frozen in time.

390
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,600
 So this first appeared in 1828 in The Aerial, a literary and critical Gazette.

391
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 And it was like one day a boat ran into another boat and it was in the Greenland and don't go up north guys. It's really, really dangerous.

392
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,600
 And I actually read that short story-- and that's the thing. I don't know if it's a short story or not. I actually read that issue of The Aerial. I found it.

393
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:17,600
 And it's really hard to tell whether or not it is a fictional exercise or a news report or a news report of an old sea shanty story.

394
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 I was looking through and it was like, "There's no section like this is the editorial section, this is the fiction section."

395
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 And I had to really dig in on what the word literary means.

396
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 And modern times, literary tends to mean fiction, but it doesn't always mean fiction. It could also be a style of writing for nonfiction.

397
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 So I wasn't given a lot of clear guidance on if the story started off as a short story.

398
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 As time went on though, we started to see some things pop up.

399
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 Sometimes the ship that we were on that spotted the Octavius was the Herald. What's the name of that ship?

400
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 Later on we saw the ship that was frozen called the Triagon and the ship that we were on called the Gloriana.

401
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 But what's weird is in-- no matter if the story had different names of the boats, they always had the same name in the captain and the same dates.

402
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 It was always August 1775 and it was always the name of the captain which I neglected to write down.

403
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 So Captain Jason Carpenter, you'll find it.

404
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 So is the story true? I think the question goes, the story could be true.

405
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 The question is, is it possible for a boat to get encased in ice?

406
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 Like, I know boats, there have been a lot of times where boats are going up north and then ice appears around them, like sneaks up on them.

407
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 It doesn't, actually, that's not what happens. The water freezes around them and the boat basically gets trapped in the ice.

408
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,600
 But I think for like, ice to grow over a boat, they wouldn't first have to be underwater.

409
00:25:53,600 --> 00:26:04,600
 Like, I just can't be standing in the snow and then I'm an ice cube, like there has to be-- I have to be standing in the snow and then a water hit me, like a giant wave hit me and then I'm frozen.

410
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 And even then, I think it would have to keep hitting me over and over again.

411
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 If I was in a boat in the middle of the Atlantic or Pacific or whatever, anywhere where there's ice, if I'm in a boat and a giant wave hit me and I'm like, "Ah!" and I get cold,

412
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 it would have to not only keep hitting me until I froze, it would have to keep hitting the boat every day for 13 years, which is what happens in the ocean. I get that.

413
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:41,600
 But because the whole boat was frozen enough that it didn't decay or anything like that, wouldn't it have to constantly be getting wet, which again, I know happened in an ocean.

414
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 I'm talking about the whole boat. Every day, a boat is not covered in water. Like, the bottom is, but it's like their sails aren't soaking wet.

415
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 If your sails are soaking wet, something's wrong. Your sails should be dry.

416
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 This is from a lifetime sailor here, apparently. I've become all of a sudden.

417
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:15,600
 I think that you need to be completely covered in ice. The boat would have to sink down for a second, like a couple minutes, then bob up and it's a giant ice cube. I think. I think.

418
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,600
 So, but I think there's a more interesting part to this story. The story may or may not be true.

419
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 But we've covered a lot of stories recently, and I don't know why I've gotten on this topic, but we've covered a lot of stories recently about ghost boats or boats that are found in the middle of nowhere, stuff like that.

420
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 All of these stories that we're hearing, especially this story. I'll use this story, for example.

421
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 Our stories were going to be hearing 500 years from now, because this boat, the Octavius, was up in Greenland, which was fairly dangerous at the time.

422
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 And you go up there and you're not ready for it, and you just freeze and you become a lost ship, and then 13 years later, someone else stumbles across you.

423
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 These stories that we hear are going to 100% be replicated once mankind goes into space.

424
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 500 years from now, people are going to be reading, little kids are going to be reading books about, like, mysteries of the solar system.

425
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 They're going to be reading these books about a passenger ship that took off past Mars, and it was never seen again, or a ship that was moving cargo across the galaxy or whatever.

426
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:32,600
 Okay, maybe that's too big, but a ship that was moving cargo from Uranus to Pluto gets lost and then reappears around Mercury eight years later.

427
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 Obviously, that story's fake. That's not possible.

428
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 But the point is, is that all of these stories we hear about ghost boats and Bermuda Triangle and things missing, they will seem incredibly mundane once we are out in the reaches of space.

429
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:57,600
 But the same elements of those stories will still exist, because what the ocean and space have in common is they're both inhospitable to man.

430
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 They're both vast. They're both extremely dangerous to cross, especially in the beginning.

431
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 And they're both full of mysteries, both on the surface and what we imagine is going on underneath.

432
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 So you can shoot a rocket up into space and fly around and go to Mars and then come back to Earth, and it's a total trip.

433
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 But once we start going farther out, when we have these stories of missing ships, of Bermuda Triangle type thing and spaces that are black holes, at some sort of time warp,

434
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:39,600
 is it just fictional stories that are getting passed around from pilot to pilot, from crew to crew, that are eventually filtering back to Earth and some author writing it down?

435
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,600
 And then those stories getting twisted from being legend to being fact over the course of hundreds of years.

436
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 And I think that some of these stories are so mundane yet creepy that they'll just simply carry over. There will be a Bermuda Triangle in space.

437
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 Someone will say, "When we go through this area, ships tend to disappear."

438
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:16,600
 And I can almost guarantee you that 500 years from now, there will be a story about a ship that goes flying off, disappears, and then a decade later they find that ship encased in an icy asteroid.

439
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:30,600
 And there'll be a log saying, "We crashed into this iceberg, floating in space, and we froze. We died in our sleep. I'm the last one. There is no hope."

440
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 Pilots and space crews will be passing that story around. Don't go into that area of space. I heard of a ship once that got trapped there. It's dangerous.

441
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 These stories will just get passed around. The crews will be different. The ships will be different. But the childlike fears we have of nature will always remain the same.
