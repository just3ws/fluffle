1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 What would you do if one of your coworkers reeked of chemicals?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 You're like, "Jason, let's have to be what I work with now."

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 But this coworker not only smelled like a meth lab,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 he also never moved.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Like, are you sure it's not a dead guy?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Who knows?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 It's a paranormal story.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 It could be a ghost.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It could be a smelly ghost.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And then we meet a man who hosts a little girl's birthday party at his house.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 But when all the kids are gone and some of the cake is left,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Shawn is hoping to have a tasty slice until he hears a knock at the door.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [music]

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Doing whatever you're doing.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Everyone give it up for a long time, Patreon supporter.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Lula F.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Woohoo, yeah, wee!

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Come on in, Lula.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Lula is strutting on into Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Lula, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon and totally understand,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 That helps out so much.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Tell your friends, tell your family, those are ways you can help the show grow.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Also, I know I've been talking about it a lot, but it's pretty cool.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Oregon Ghost Conference, March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Yours truly will be giving a presentation on why are there no fat ghosts.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And I'm still surprised they haven't just thought, I'm joking.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 They haven't thought that this is some elaborate troll.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And, yeah, but they haven't figured that out yet.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 It's not a troll, it's not a troll.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I'm really looking forward to it.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It'll be a lot of fun.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And I hope to see some of you guys there.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 It's $15 and it's for three days.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It's not $15 just to see me.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And you get three days of speakers and vendors tables and all that stuff.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And it's spring break in Seaside, Oregon, apparently.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's a booming resort for college kids as well.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So if you're looking for love, or if you're a serial killer,

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 or if you're trying to emulate Ted Bundy, swing on by.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Actually, don't come by if you're going to murder anybody.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 But if you want to check out the Seaside,

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 if you want to check out the coast of Oregon,

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 if you want to listen to me talk about,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 you do it now for free, but I don't want you to pay $15 to do it.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I don't get the $15.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 It's not like I'm like, I saw some guy in the back.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 He didn't pay me.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I'm not going to start speaking until I get some money.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But guys, that'd be really cool if you could come out.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 It'd be a lot of fun.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Lula, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Jason Jalopy, we're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Drive us all the way out to an Air Force Base.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 [imitates air force]

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 It's a nice leisurely drive all the way out to this unnamed Air Force Base.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We don't know where this story actually took place.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 National Security and all, they don't want it to get out to where the smelliest airmen are,

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 but we're headed all the way out to this military base.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 We're going to meet a man named Jerry.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 When he tells us this story, he said it all started back in the year 2008.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He was in tech school.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 When you go into Air Force, I had to look this up on Wikipedia.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 You join the Air Force and they go, "You, you, you, you, you.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 All of you guys are going to be airplane mechanics."

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And then they're like, "And you five guys, you're going to...

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You're going to fold your arms out and fly around and pretend to be planes."

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 They're like, "Oh, okay."

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And then you guys, you're going to be the maintenance crew and everyone gets their jobs.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And then you go to tech school to learn how to do your job, which sounds super weird.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It really does.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 You show up and you're like, "Oh, I can't wait to be an airplane pilot."

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And they're like, "You'll be an airplane pilot?"

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 You're like, "Yes."

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Putting their socks on, you're like, "What? I didn't know it was a job."

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They're like, "Yeah." When they wear all the gloves and they got that really cool visor on,

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 that visor is cool, isn't it?

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 You're like, "Yeah."

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 They can't see their socks.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So you'll be the guy to put on the socks.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He's like, "Do I just put on the socks or do I put on the shoes too?"

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Oh, no, no, no.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 That's too technical for you.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You just put on their socks.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 You're going to work two hours a day and the rest of the time you're just going to steady socks.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 What the socks?

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Well, I'm going to tech school.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Anyways, he's in tech school and this guy, Jerry, says, "In my class was this other guy."

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Now, these names aren't real.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Jerry said that he knew this guy named Paul.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 He was also in this tech class.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And he goes, "Man, listen, Paul was a weirdo.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 First off, he looked weird."

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And you go, "Jason, that's kind of rude.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 You don't really talk about people's personal appearance on here.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Are you going to start listing off a bunch of different things?"

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 No.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 There wasn't anything like he had any noticeable, or at least that Jerry put down,

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 like noticeable physical issues.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 There was just something off about him.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's not like his ears or his nose or his mouth.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He just looked at him and something was weird.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So not definable weirdness.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 He also reaped of chemicals.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Probably, it's probably one of those situations where you couldn't put your finger on it.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Because otherwise you would say, "Yeah, man, I hate to work with Paul.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He smelled like formaldehyde."

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Or, "Woo-wee!"

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 The other day I was in sock school with Paul and he smelled like rubbing alcohol.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It wasn't any particular chemical.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He just smelled like chemicals are emanating from his body.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He's smelly.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He's weird.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 He didn't look right.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But he also, Jerry goes, "It was so weird because he would start these super weird conversations."

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 He would start these super weird conversations.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And that was odd enough.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But he almost went out of his way to be weird.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 He wakes up in the morning and he's like, "Ah, nothing like a good bath and gots to chemicals."

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 He's taking a chemical bath.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He's like, "Okay, now it's time to be weird."

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 He's making his eyeballs roll around.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 He would start weird conversations.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And not only would he start weird conversations, like, do you happen to like avocados or are you more of a peach person?

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Not only would he start weird conversations like that, he also, they came off very scripted.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It wasn't like he was actually curious.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Like, I may start an odd conversation.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 What was I thinking about the other day?

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Like, what happens to a rat when he gets too fat to walk out of a rat hole?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 What does he do? Does he just stay in there?

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Is that the life cycle of a rat?

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Did he just eat as much cheese and peanut butter as possible and then he just dies in his hole?

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And I may ask that question to an exterminator.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Exterminator comes over and says, "Oh my God, this place smells like a thousand rats who've died on the walls."

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I was like, "Yeah, I've been running some experiments. I wonder if you get it."

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I may ask weird questions, right?

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But I'm genuinely curious.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He said he goes, he asks weird questions and it was like he had the conversation scripted in his head already.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Everything seemed scripted about him.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Like, he had prepared to ask the weird question and he had prepared his responses no matter what you answered.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And he goes, it was like watching someone who was trying to pretend to be normal, but didn't know what normal was.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 That was the feeling that he gave Jerry. That's the feeling he gave everyone.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But the creepiest thing, this was the one thing that was kind of setting everyone off.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And this is where we go beyond just a weird lady playing in a court in 20 feet outside your apartment

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 to straight up paranormal or alien behavior because he goes, listen, I'll tell you,

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 in our base we had very, very sensitive motion detectors, which you would hope on a military base, right?

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They definitely splurge on that stuff.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He goes, we had motion detectors and our hallway lights were set up

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 that if no one walked in the hallway for 30 minutes or more, the lights shut off.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And you open your door and the lights turn on.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Right? Super sensitive. You see the dark hallway, you take a step into it, all the lights turn on.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's a well-lit hallway because that's another thing you want on a military base.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 You want a line of sight.

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You want to be able to see clearly in case any ninjas are lurking around.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He goes, you would walk into one of these hallways and it would be pitch black.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 You take a step and the lights start to light up the path in front of you, the entire hallway is illuminated.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And there, standing in the middle of the hallway was Paul.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Now, not like he had just stepped out of his dorm.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It's not like he was entering the hallway the same time you were.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 The implication was he was standing there perfectly still for more than 30 minutes.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Long enough he couldn't move at all until the lights shut off.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And then just stood there in the dark for who knows how long.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Until someone else stepped into the hallway and the lights came on and you would just see Paul standing there.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Now, listen man, this could be like an Air Force Urban Legend.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It could be like, you better watch out if you don't sleep.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 If you airman don't get to sleep tonight, Paul will show up at your room and he'll just be smelly.

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He's not scaring anyway.

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It could be some sort of Urban Legend.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But it's an interesting story.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 It's not finished.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Jerry goes on to say, Paul was not a smart guy either.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Could have had something to do with all those chemicals coming out of his pores.

182
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But Paul was not a smart man.

183
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 He actually was really struggling with his classes.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And as he was training and he was in the Air Force longer, I guess when they sign you up they do like a cursory examination.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 But I guess you have to depend on what job they were going to put you in.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 They start doing security clearances on him, more in-depth security clearances on him.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He's not able to pass any of them.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 His superiors are starting to realize they can't verify any of his background.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And because of his poor grades, his poor performance, and the fact that he can't really be qualified for the job that they need to put him in.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And he's a big weirdo who's super stinky.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Which I think, I don't think that you can get kicked out of the Army or Air Force because of that.

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But it was just the icing on the cake.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 The Air Force decided to let him go.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 The problem was they weren't even able to do that.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Because Jerry goes, the military training instructors on the base had told Jerry this part of the story.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He wasn't privy to this, but he found out later.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 He goes, "Yeah, we went to basically discharge him. He wasn't able to meet the standards of the Air Force."

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And we couldn't, we had nowhere to send him.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 The address he put down did not exist.

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And neither did any of his family members.

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 All the information he put down regarding his home and his family contacts and everything like that, it just was no record of anybody.

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And they would ask him about it, because they're trying to make phone calls.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 They're trying to get this guy out of here.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 "Hey, nice guy, he's a little stinky. You stay in the other room while we're making these phone calls."

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 They couldn't verify any of this stuff.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And when they would ask him, "Hey, Paul, we tried calling your mom, but this phone number you gave, it's not working."

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 "Do you have another phone number?" And he would look at him and be like, "No, that's my mom's phone number."

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And no matter what they did, he'd be like, "No, that's the address they live at. That's the address that I live at."

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 "This other address, that's where I live at."

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And none of it matched up.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 They could never verify any of it.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 But they did eventually kick him out. They just gave him a pointy stick and kicked him out into the wilderness surrounding the Air Force Base.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 They're like, "Find your way home, young man."

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 No, they were eventually able to discharge him from the military.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It's an interesting story. It's interesting because on the one hand it does feel almost like an urban legend, because it's so fantastical.

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I think the idea is that he is an alien or some sort of robot, some sort of clone.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Because the smell, right? That's what I was thinking.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 The motion, all of this stuff, it's definitely not human.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 People who kind of seem off and people who have conversations that are highly scripted in their heads, both of those are normal.

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Both of those I've met people who have done that.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Totally normal people.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Smell reasonable. They smell like a normal human should, and they haven't made up their entire past.

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So those two elements, even people who may look physically "normal," they have something off about them.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Those elements are totally normal.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It's being motionless for 30 minutes or more standing up.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's a feat. That is quite the feat.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And also, whether or not you could physically do it, why would you do it?

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Why would you stand in a...

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Why would you stand in this hallway just waiting for someone to walk into it?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You think alien spy or alien robot spy? Terrible.

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Or what if another human country made it and sent it over?

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's a terrible spy, though. Just the tip. Don't make your spies smelly.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We covered that a long time ago on Dead or Abra Radio about the story of Terare, the man who could eat anything.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I'll put that in some of the show notes. That's one of my favorites.

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I think we did that as a Classics episode, too.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Smelliest man possible. You could smell the food digesting in the stomach.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 People said you could see visible stink lines emanate around his body.

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 They turned him into a spy.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 They sent him over. I think they were... I think it was like French and German or something like that.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They sent him over enemy lines. He got caught instantly because he was disgusting.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And of course, if you're going to notice, they got stink lines, right? He can't blend in.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Anyways, it's an interesting story.

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I give the story a little bit of credence because when I looked through Jerry's posting history,

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 he goes online by the name Poop Smith 87.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And while generally people whose name involved fecal matter, they may not be the most trustworthy.

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Or I shouldn't say that, but jokesters, they may be tricksters.

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 What was interesting was I read this post and then everything else they posted on.

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's so funny because you might go, "Wow, this guy's more of a maniac than I thought."

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Then I go, "Oh, this guy's normal."

250
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Poop Smith 87, when I looked at the other stuff he posted on, he posted in Marshall Arts.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 He posted talking about Marshall Arts. He talked about knives. Totally normal. Totally normal.

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Those two go hand in hand.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And it was interesting because he talked about crawlers. That's that cryptid.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I've seen him. I'll put the episode on the show notes of walking around on all fours, long, white creatures.

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They're creepy. They're creepy.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I had an experience with them. I'll put them in the show notes.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He had an interesting theory I hadn't heard before. He says, "I think that crawlers are feral humans."

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I was like, "Oh, that's super interesting. I don't necessarily agree with that."

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But they do look like people walking on all fours.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The first time I saw one, I only saw the back hindquarters of it.

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 The way the back sloped down, like I could see it's from the bottom of the rib cage, right?

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Imagine a man walking on all fours and you block part of them by a Honda Civic.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So I see from the bottom of the rib cage, the kind of butt is angled up in the air with the long legs.

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And it walked by. I was walking up the street. I'd say clear as day. It was in the middle of the night.

265
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It was probably about five in the morning. I saw it walk by.

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And the way that back sloped down looked like it was somebody walking on all fours.

267
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And their arms were shorter, obviously, than your legs.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I thought it was a lunatic. I thought, like, I had to kind of... I still had to get to work.

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I had to walk by it, but a bunch of big foots are attacking me.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I was like, "Oh, it's just the day in the daily community, Jason."

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I kind of walked around the car to put some space between me and it.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I don't know what I was thinking. I kind of was like cutting it off almost.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I didn't really think anything at the time. I didn't go, "Oh, that's just... Because if I thought...

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 If I honestly thought in my head that is a naked hobo hiding behind that car, I would have stopped.

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I would have totally stopped. I didn't know what it was. I knew it was something.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I saw it clearly. I could count... I couldn't say I could count all the ribs, but I could count one rib.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Like, I was that close. I could see the bone and the skin attaching to the skeleton.

278
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And you're just in kind of... It's a moment. It's a moment.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Like, you don't think about it while you're there, but I was like, "Oh, something just walked behind this Honda Civic.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I'm going to have to walk into the street around it. I got off the sidewalk and I'm looking and I'm kind of ready.

281
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I had like this... I think I might have had my flashlight baseball bat. I don't know if I had it with me,

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 but I remember kind of walking around ready to something might attack me and nothing was there.

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 It wasn't a trigger light. I saw it as clearly as I can walk down the street and see someone walking on the street too.

284
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It was 100% a thing. And then maybe like a week or two later, I saw it again.

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And this time it was probably a good 100 yards, maybe farther away, and it was running through the...

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It was running through the Walmart parking lot. That might have been crazy.

287
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 That might have been a crazy homeless person, but just running through the Walmart parking lot is very quick.

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I actually thought I was at the top of the stairs that lead down to the Walmart parking lot.

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm seeing this thing run and I honestly thought it was a dog at that distance.

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I thought it was a dog with no hair.

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And then it got like... I'm at the top of the stairs. It's running. It's running. It's running as fast as it can.

292
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I'm pretty sure I had a weapon. I'm pretty sure I had a weapon at some point.

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So I think I had that flashlight little baseball bat that I carry.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And I had braced myself and I'm watching it run, run, run.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And there was something weird about the way that it ran too. It was almost like out of juice.

296
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 The way it was running, it wasn't super...

297
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Beastal. It wasn't like ready to... It would have eaten me if it had gotten to me.

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 But there seemed to be something a little desperate about the way it was running.

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But anyways, it was running and I'm at the top of the stairs and I watch it run.

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And it's through the bottom of the stairs and I lose sight of it because the way that, you know, the top of the stairs, I don't have that angled in.

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And I'm not moving. I'm waiting for it to come up the stairs so it's even more out of gas if I have to fight this thing.

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You know, running up stairs is going to kind of de-energize it.

303
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And nothing's down there.

304
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And the way that the stairs are situated, if it ran either direction, I would have seen it.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And then I never saw anything like it again. Now it's possible it was a bear with mange or dog with mange or a feral human.

306
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I really liked that scenario. Crawlers or something. I don't know what it is.

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Like, I didn't even know it was a thing until I saw it.

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 So I'm not going to be like, "No, it has to be this. It has to be an interdimensional creature. It has to be a real life."

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I don't know what in the world I saw.

310
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Saw it twice within maybe like a week or two and I never saw it again.

311
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So I like that theory and the reason why I wanted to point that out was because the fact that he's like debunked, he's like, I think crawlers are feral humans.

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 He's not married to the world of the paranormal. I couldn't find anything where he's like, "Oh, and then after the Air Force I got abducted by aliens."

313
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And they said, "Remember, Paul?" And then I turned around and Paul was actually a space captain.

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Because then you're like, "Okay, this is made up. This is made up. Sometimes the story is going to be too good."

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So is it possible that there was an alien infiltrator at this Air Force base? A bad one at that?

316
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Or was it just the smelly, awkward guy who could stand still for 30 minutes or more?

317
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Interesting, it's an interesting phenomenon and I honestly lean towards the alien.

318
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And you're like, "What the heck is that? Jason, you do do a paranormal vodgas. Who would have guessed that you would lean towards the most ridiculous one?"

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 We have run out of time. I actually thought we'd have more time.

320
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But I don't--the cake--you've been waiting on pins and needles. You're like, "Oh man, you actually made a cake for this episode?"

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 You're like, "Oh dude, he's going to talk about cake. Cake. Cake. Cake the whole episode."

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We're going to have to save the cake story till tomorrow. I think that's probably the smart play.

323
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I definitely can't play it and I think I have like 10 minutes left. I don't think I would do it justice.

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 But I do have one more story for you. I don't want to leave you totally unsatisfied.

325
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Lula, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the world famous Carbinder cop through where they're leaving behind this Air Force space.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Take us all the way out to Canada. I know a lot of you Canadian fans love this show.

327
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Everyone else shut it off. They're like, "Click. Oh great, it's a Canada story. Woo! So fun of their--what? No Canada. It's just as cool as any other country."

328
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I don't know why you guys are saying that.

329
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Fly us all the way out to beautiful Canada.

330
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Specifically, we're going to Ontario, Canada. The year is 1914 and we're walking around.

331
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's beautiful sunny days. Grass everywhere. We're just kind of sitting by the side of a lake.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We're in a place called the Georgian Bay. We're watching like ducks fly by.

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 [Ducks fly by]

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Little beavers building a dam. They're like, "This sure is awesome."

335
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 You go, "What year is it, Jason? Did you say what year the story takes place?" And I have a little haze seen in my mouth.

336
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I was like, "Well, it takes place in the year 1914."

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So look at this beautiful lake in front of us.

338
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Look at that duck. That duck's dead by the time we're telling the story in 2023.

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 That duck's entire bloodline has been wiped from the planet. I hope he enjoys eating whatever ducks eat today.

340
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 [Ducks fly by]

341
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Well, apparently, a day in 1914 on Georgian Bay, there were eight witnesses who were out just like us, hanging out, enjoying the sunlight.

342
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And they see a UFO floating on the water.

343
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They see a UFO floating on the water. They'd have no context for it. You probably think it was a boat.

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But on shore, there was a group of entities. That's how they describe them.

345
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Entities, little alien people holding a hose that was dipped into the water and then the hose was going into the UFO.

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 The implication is they're sucking up some of that sweet, sweet Georgian Bay.

347
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Well, when the aliens realized that they were being watched, the aliens realized they were being watched, they very quickly pulled the hose up out of the water,

348
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 jumped on board the UFO, pulled the hose back into the UFO and took off.

349
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But in their haste to leave, they left a little alien guy behind.

350
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And he's just standing out there on the shore. These eight witnesses are watching this little alien guy stand there.

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And he ran away.

352
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 This story, it's so funny because I came across this story just the other day and think about it, ducks.com.

353
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And to be fair, this is rare. This is actually the first time I've come across this.

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Think about it, ducks.com, for this story. This took place in 1914. There's no source.

355
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 They're really, really good at sourcing their stuff, even if it's some out of date or out of publication book.

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 They'll give you the title and the authors and all that stuff. No source for this story.

357
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 What I think is so interesting is this is another thing that I've talked about maybe three or four times on the show.

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I find it so evocative. We've done whole segments on it. And I've always thought, like, this must happen.

359
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 This must happen. I'll put the episodes on the show notes. It's the idea of aliens being left behind.

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Like, on accident. We have a lot of stories of UFOs crashing, right? Very dramatic crashes like the story of Roswell.

361
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But the idea of an alien being left behind, a castaway. And we know it has to happen because we do it.

362
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 At this point in UFO lore, you can say their technology is higher, but they have all of the same problems as humans.

363
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Not necessarily. You could say, well, they've cured all their diseases and they're all unified and blah, blah, blah, social order and stuff like that.

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But they still make mistakes and we make mistakes. They still build shoddy vehicles and we build shoddy vehicles.

365
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 We still get lost. And they get lost. It's a fascinating story.

366
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It's this idea of a little dude being left behind and what do you do in that situation?

367
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Like, how terrifying would that be?

368
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Imagine it was just you on a road trip with your friends and when you got out to use the restroom at a local gas station, you come out.

369
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 They're pumping the car full of water. All of a sudden they bring this hose out of your car and they're pumping it full of water from a local leg.

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 People are like, "What? You can't steal our water? Get out of here." And they drove off and now you're stuck at this gas station.

371
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I guess your life takes it. It's 2023. I would be like, "Can I use your phone? My friends are idiots. Can I call for another ride?"

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But I remember they were also stealing water. So they may be like, "We don't like people around here stealing our water."

373
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 You're like, "What?"

374
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 It's raining right now. There's more water coming down. You have an umbrella. Why are you so upset about it?

375
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Get them! Get them! They're taking our water.

376
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 It wasn't that they were just... It's not just that you were left behind. I brought the people probably 1914. They're like, "What? Oh no, they're still in our water. I don't think they probably cared about that."

377
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I don't think that was the highlight of their day. They're like, "Guys, you won't believe it. We were down at the bay earlier and someone was stealing our water."

378
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 People are like, "What?" And they're like, "Yes." And then they flew away. Like, "What? You should start with that part. That's the word you're interested in.

379
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Some guys came down from the sky and stole your water. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I wanted to get to the water stealing part as soon as possible.

380
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 It would be the same thing if your friends left you behind. You're all at Coachella.

381
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And you're like, "I hate this music. I love violin garbage." And you're like, "Oh, okay. Well, come to Coachella anyways. There will be no violins. You'll hate it."

382
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And then they mess up the Tupac hologram. And then all of a sudden it's you on stage trying to be Tupac. People are like, "What? That's not Tupac?"

383
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And they leave you there. And you're like, "Ah, I feel just like an alien in 1914." It would be awful. It would be absolutely terrible to be left behind in any situation.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So imagine now that you're a tiny alien at Coachella. People are like, "What? That's definitely not Tupac. He's not an alien. He's not doing these alien dances."

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 He's like, "Oh, no. I'm better than Tupac." What? People are like, "Ah, you're not only left behind, but you're just not suited for this world."

386
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 How sad. How terrifying. Did they ever come back for him? Did he befriend some wildlife and spend his last couple days on earth like riding on the back of a moose going on some sort of adventure?

387
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Was he eaten by a bear? Did he immediately run into the woods and a Canadian bear pounce upon him and just eat him to bits? Who knows?

388
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 It's a crazy story. It's a sad story, or maybe it's an adventurous story. Maybe he did go on all these adventures. Maybe he lived a very long life as this little alien dude in the Canadian woods.

389
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 One can hope. One can hope that right now in the darkness of the woods there's an old grizzled alien with his half-alien, half-moose children.

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 There are these great aliens with big antlers and they're sitting in the woods and he's like, "They're like, "Grandpa, Grandpa, tell us the story again."

391
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And when those jerks left you on earth, then he goes, "Oh, I don't want to tell that story again." Plus, I don't know if I'd really call them jerks nowadays.

392
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 If they hadn't left me on this beautiful blue orb, I wouldn't have you freaks of nature surrounding me.

393
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So go to sleep, kids. Go to sleep and dream of a better world, which actually turned out to be this world all along.

394
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And then he puts a hose and then he sucks, he's sucking water out of the door to me.

395
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 With a giant straw, he's like, "Goodnight, kids. Time for a drink for good old grandpa."

396
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 This show's getting ridiculous. This show's just getting ridiculous at this point. It's the end of the season.

397
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 There's generally a meltdown as we get close to the end, but I'm still having so much fun.

398
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Still having so much fun.
