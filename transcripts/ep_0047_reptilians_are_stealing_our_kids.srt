00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 Apple sensors Alex Jones and child molestine reptilians have taken over

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,640
 Antarctica today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,920
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,840
 host Jason Carpenter I'm having a great day I hope you're having a great day. Got

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,880
 a lot of good stories for you today. Today's actually the first day of my

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,480
 vacation so that's pretty awesome. Took a long nap. Don't really have much planned.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,760
 Napping, working on the podcast, hanging out with my family, stuff like that would be pretty cool.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,520
 You know this is a weird thing I don't know how many of my audience does drugs.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,600
 I assume it's probably like a 50/50 split maybe a little bit more and when I

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,080
 say drugs I mean like basic drugs like marijuana. I'm not talking like how much

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,500
 of my audience is heroin which I'm sure is an insignificant amount but what I

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,440
 think is interesting have you ever done drugs in your dreams? Every show often

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,100
 I'll have a dream where I smoke weed. I don't smoke weed anymore because I get

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,840
 drug tested all the time but I I've had dreams where I've done drugs in my

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,280
 dreams and the dream like your dream state becomes incredible. It becomes

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,840
 basically what you think drugs do to you when you're a kid like when you're a kid

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,400
 you think drugs make Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck dance around in front of

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
 you and it's not the case. Spoiler alert for anyone who hasn't smoked marijuana

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,000
 it's not that cool. It does make television incredibly amazing but it

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,840
 doesn't make you hallucinate. Well I did hallucinate a couple times but anyway

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,320
 that's beside the point. The point is is that in dreams or I've done drugs it's

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,600
 totally tripped me out. It's been the most intense experience. So my question I

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
 wonder why I've actually heard other people say that too when they do drugs

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,640
 in their dreams it's like the most intense possible experience and I'm

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,000
 wondering if because the brain is trying to simulate the effect of the drug it

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,480
 just goes overboard or actually I just thought of this maybe when you do drugs

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,800
 you do have this totally intense impact on your brain but you can only perceive

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,920
 so much information while that's going on. So you may actually your brain to your

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,640
 brain it could be like some sort of cataclysmic slash orgasmic event but

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,320
 because your ego couldn't handle that it kind of just makes you want to eat

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,480
 Taco Bell and watch The Sweet Life on Deck. So I don't know but yeah whenever

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,440
 I've done drugs in my dreams it's the most intense drug experience ever. So let's

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,880
 talk about the big news of the day. Again I'm recording this on Monday but you'll

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,720
 be hearing it on Friday because we're doing the pre-recording so I don't have

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,480
 much of a gap while I'm on vacation. But the big news of the day Monday is that

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,760
 Alex Jones was taken off of iTunes. His podcast four of his five podcasts were

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,080
 taken off of iTunes. He was I believe taken completely off of Spotify. Facebook

38
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,640
 has shut down some of his pages. YouTube I think as of now may still have one or

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
 two of it like they were taking down individual videos. iTunes announced that

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640
 they were taking down his podcast at three in the morning local time which is

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,400
 unusual. I think they knew that these other sites were going to take him down

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 and iTunes wanted to be first they wanted to set the benchmark. Here's my

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,600
 thing about Alex Jones. So when I first I used to be a 9/11 truth or I used to be

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,440
 more believing in these conspiracy theories and that's when people go do

45
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
 your research do your research. I was reading about Osama bin Laden when he

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
 gave an interview I think it was with Time Magazine or Newsweek back in 2000. I

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,240
 was researching 9/11 on 9/12 like I was into that truth or movement and into

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,440
 those conspiracy theories conspiracy theories and spent years and

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,240
 years and years looking into it and I always say generally you fall down the

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,320
 rabbit hole and eventually you end up back on the surface and you go out of

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,640
 everything's fake that's all nonsense. If you keep an open mind you fall through

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,600
 the rabbit hole you come back and you're like yeah it wasn't a waste of time I

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,480
 enjoyed the journey but most of the conspiracies out there are complete and

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,680
 utter garbage entertaining garbage but garbage nonetheless so I used to go to

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,220
 Info Wars and Prison Planet back in 2001-2002. It was amazing it was this huge

56
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,760
 treasure trove of conspiracy thought. I've always seen Alex Jones as an

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:26,360
 entertainer first and a quote-unquote journalist second and for lack of a

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,120
 better term. I think Alex Jones had a character I think he might have originally

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,080
 believed some of the stuff he says but I don't think he actually believes most of

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,340
 it. I think you would have to be a lunatic to believe every every single

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,620
 thing that he's talked about over the years. It would drive you mad so I

62
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,180
 believe it's an act during his divorce with his wife his defense lawyer said

63
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,820
 as much he doesn't act like this around his kids this is a performance that he

64
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,380
 puts on and he lost that case by the way his wife is getting a ton of money

65
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,860
 through alimony because he cheated on her apparently I don't know allegedly I

66
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,840
 guess I should say. Now if you are a journalist and you are stating facts and

67
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
 you can show your work basically is a term I like to use a lot with the

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,400
 conspiracy theory community you can say what you want you can say reptilians are

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,680
 taken over the planet but show your work show me documents show me proof and

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,760
 I'll believe you I'll be on your side but if you can't show your work then

71
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,600
 you're no different than someone telling me that China is making fake cabbage

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,640
 you're using undisclosed surface sources you're using people that are easily

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,380
 disputed and so on and so forth. Alex Jones can't show his work if Alex Jones

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,740
 could actually show his work and say Sandy Hook was fake which is one of the

75
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,100
 big lawsuits he's facing now by two families of Sandy Hook victims if he

76
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,140
 could prove that if a journalist or a researcher can prove that you have that

77
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,820
 as your defense but when you're just acting when you're just making it up

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,260
 and then people say what you're saying is hateful you have no defense well you

79
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,560
 have one which is the First Amendment but that one covers you from the

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,720
 government and two it only covers you in the United States and what iTunes and

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,760
 Google and Spotify and YouTube and all these groups can say is one we're a

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,040
 private company so we can choose what's on our platform and we feel you are

83
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,760
 being hateful Mr. Jones or yes you are protected by the First Amendment in the

84
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,560
 United States but because we are a global company we have to follow basically

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,300
 the strictest laws the way America works is that generally the strictest law is

86
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,140
 what you fall under if California has very strict gun control laws but the

87
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,300
 this nation has more lax gun control laws generally fall under the purview of

88
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,740
 the strictest law and I think that's what's happening to Alex Jones. Alex

89
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,420
 Jones what they are saying is that he makes hateful content towards

90
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,500
 gays, transgendered people, and Muslims in particular so they took his shows off.

91
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,560
 Do I think that causes a problem for the conspiracy community in large? Do I

92
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,880
 think that the fact that these outlets are banning Alex Jones do I think it

93
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,040
 makes an impact on the conspiracy theory community at large? I do. I think it may

94
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,720
 make a positive impact. I think Alex Jones has been such a magnet of attention

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,760
 that if he's no longer the most visible voice in the conspiracy community I

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,260
 think it may be taken a little more seriously. I think generally when you

97
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,940
 start talking about conspiracies or something like that and someone can

98
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,660
 immediately just go "Water's turning the frogs gay!" it dismisses it all. Now to be

99
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,380
 fair most conspiracy theories deserve to get dismissed but I think you know what

100
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,700
 I'm saying he is so bombastic and so such a caricature of a conspiracy

101
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,260
 theorist I think that it may help. I think it'll make room for other people to

102
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,900
 kind of move up in that conspiracy theory realm. Do I think that as society at

103
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,960
 large it is beneficial to have Alex Jones removed? No, I don't. I don't. Now to be

104
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,120
 fair on that the comments that he makes that some would consider hateful and to

105
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,160
 be honest I don't watch the show. I went to the website a lot but that was

106
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,160
 before he did his show. I've only seen the clips most people have seen so when

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,920
 they say that he's hateful towards gays or transgendered or Muslim people I

108
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,740
 don't know. So they're making that claim and I don't know. I haven't seen any

109
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,700
 clips or anything like that but I think for society at large for some of the

110
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,060
 biggest content providers to shut someone down because they say they're

111
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,660
 producing hate speech when in general he's not known for producing hate

112
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,020
 speech in general he's known for saying crazy things about Sandy Hook and 9/11

113
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,460
 and say Tannock pedophile, Stake on the World and stuff like that. He's not

114
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,800
 Richard Spencer where that's all he's saying. He generally makes these wacky

115
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,340
 conspiracy theories and I think what the problem is is that we have him deep

116
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,200
 platforms from some of the major major platforms. I've heard the term this is

117
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,400
 basically digital book burning because he will be gone. It costs a lot to host

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,920
 the podcast or especially video on your own site. The upload download the bandwidth

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,840
 is insane so you get deep platform from these major major platforms. There's

120
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,220
 nothing else for him to really distribute his content and you know keep his

121
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,660
 company going. And I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a

122
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,180
 Roseanne James Gunn situation where the left takes out Roseanne for her tweet

123
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,460
 about a black woman look like a monkey which I can't believe that she still

124
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,180
 wrote that. And then the right takes out James Gunn for tweeting jokes about

125
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,740
 pedophilia and it just becomes this tit for tat this back-and-forth thing. I

126
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,220
 think that's what we're going to see. What the next big push will be to get

127
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,760
 young Turks de-platformed or something like that. And I don't think that type

128
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,560
 of tribal warfare is good for society. I don't think that it's good for the

129
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,640
 culture. So yeah it'll be interesting. I have and I have a feeling that this isn't

130
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,720
 going to last very long. I have a feeling that this is going to be revoked.

131
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,060
 So that they are going to allow him back on the platforms. Because I just don't.

132
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,760
 I don't see it sticking. I think he could if he can prove that I never made those

133
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,580
 hateful comments or those that video that I supposedly made a hateful comment

134
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,100
 had been up for two years on iTunes. So it'll be interesting to see how this

135
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,100
 plays out. But again I think for the community for the conspiracy theory

136
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,780
 community it's nice to have one of the biggest most laughable characters in it

137
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,200
 removed is beneficial because then more more thought-provoking or more well

138
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,300
 thought-out conspiracy theorists can move to the top. But I think as society at

139
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,780
 large I don't think it's a good thing. So we'll see how this plays out. Okay last

140
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,460
 story of the day we're going out there. And when I say out there we're going from

141
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,980
 outer space to ice in your face. I don't know I couldn't come up with anything for

142
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,420
 that. So apparently this again this seems to be a political episode but it just

143
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,380
 happened to be that way. So what's going on according to this truth seeker this

144
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:26,580
 man above men this fear bean. Fear bean? That's his website. So there's this guy

145
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,140
 named Corey Good. So quick info on Corey Good. Corey Good has been kidnapped

146
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,940
 multiple times by the United States Air Force. I mean just like they've come in

147
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,900
 and they've taken him and they're like how are you revealing all of our secrets

148
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,900
 and Corey Good's like I can't tell you and the Air Force is like tell us who's

149
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,620
 the leak and Corey Good's like I won't tell you the Air Force lets him go.

150
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,380
 Because what you know that's what military is known for. They're known for

151
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,780
 taking people prisoner and then letting them go when they don't get what they

152
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,300
 want. This happened multiple times. Poor Corey Good being abducted. Where are you

153
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,820
 getting your secrets? Who is leaking our info to you and Corey Good's like I will

154
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:15,820
 not tell you. And then one day Corey Good is taken in by a secret U.S. Air Force

155
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,260
 agent who works for special space command named Sigmund and the agent goes

156
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,620
 who's giving you this information and Corey Good goes aliens are talking on my

157
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,860
 brain and the agent goes yes you are right aliens are talking to your brain

158
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,340
 here's even more secret documents for you to leak. Together we can destroy the

159
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,540
 pedophiles who are taking over the planet. So now Corey Good is no longer

160
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,420
 being kidnapped by the U.S. Air Force. He's working for them along with his

161
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,020
 telepathic alien baby in his brain and what he has to report this time is that

162
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:03,660
 special teams of soldiers from around the world is like a straight-up GI Joe are

163
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:12,020
 capturing high-level world powerful pedophiles. Get down on the ground pedophile.

164
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,620
 No I own eight banks in Europe stay down. Watch I'm gonna get flagged for hate

165
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,700
 speech because of that accent. The pedophile anti-pedophile special forces

166
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,220
 teams have been raiding groups across the United States and they're shocked

167
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,100
 shocked at how deeply these people are in the U.S. government. This team has been

168
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,140
 in effect by the way in the middle since the middle of the election but since

169
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,740
 Donald Trump's become president it's become totally ramped up and at this

170
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,660
 point a special forces some of them have actually been fired unfortunately from

171
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,300
 this made-up job. They're having to collect made-up unemployment. They've

172
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,060
 been fired from this made-up job for killing low-level pedophiles. That has

173
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,300
 to be the worst description ever. That not only are you a pedophile you're a

174
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,460
 low-level pedophile. That's like you only have sex with baby ducks. Like you

175
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,100
 don't even qualify to be as gross as a regular pedophile you're just a low-level

176
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,340
 pedophile. Other pedophiles look down on you. Anyway so these special forces

177
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,060
 squads a couple of these guys have been fired from this made-up job because

178
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,860
 they've been killing these low-level pedophiles because they're just so angry.

179
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,620
 Now before we get into the weird part let me just do an aside. Yes there are we

180
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:33,460
 do have a pedophile problem. It's everywhere and it's super gross. Before I

181
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,060
 go any further I think I need to make this clear. I'm not making fun of

182
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,540
 pedophilia and yes there are powerful people out there who are pedophiles.

183
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:48,060
 What I have a problem with is the idea that a pedophilic network is running

184
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,620
 the planet. I think that idea is laughable. I think that there are private

185
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,820
 groups of people who want to have their vision of the world put onto everyone

186
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,020
 else. I think that is such a basic description of the illuminati or

187
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,260
 conspiracies. I think that's fair. I think that if I had a billion dollars I

188
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,020
 would want people I would want to leave my impact on the world and I would want

189
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,020
 the world to see the world as I see it because I think I know what I'm doing

190
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,540
 is right. So when you have George Soros or you have the what is it the Koch

191
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,100
 brothers the Koch brothers they're both the same thing. They're opposing forces

192
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,940
 but they're both the same thing. They both have massive amounts of money and

193
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,300
 they use that money to reshape the world and how they see it. I do not think that

194
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,820
 they're both pedophiles that know a million other pedophiles that are

195
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,700
 running the planet and if the Koch brothers knew that George Soros was a

196
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,060
 pedophile or vice versa that'd be the first attack line every single day.

197
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,780
 One of them goes, you know, my opponent believes that climate change is not

198
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,460
 man-made and the other people would be like he's a pedophile. That would be the

199
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,180
 only conversation ever. So either they're both pedophiles and in that case it

200
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,180
 doesn't matter because everyone's a pedophile or one is and one isn't and

201
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,300
 that would be the only line of attack ever. This person believes that taxes on

202
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,380
 corporations should be 10% that person's a pedophile. That would be every single

203
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,380
 conversation and all of these stories would be buried 100% of the time

204
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,260
 because if everyone in the power structure even let's say 10% or 2% of

205
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,940
 the world's power structure was powerful enough to not only hide their own

206
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,300
 crimes but initiate other people into their group. We would never hear about

207
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,860
 any of these stories. Corey Goode would be a smudge at the bottom of the

208
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,500
 Empire State Building. So that's my problem with these stories about these

209
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 worldwide groups of super powerful people that are doing this Illuminati

210
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,020
 Satanic pedophilia group. There are powerful people who are pedophiles

211
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,060
 absolutely. There are networks of pedophiles absolutely. Those are facts. We

212
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,300
 catch them. We bust them not as often as we should but we do. But this idea like

213
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,660
 Corey Goode's putting forth that local police are in on it. Local reporters are

214
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,380
 in on it. Low level politicians are in on it.

215
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,580
 Entertainment industry is in on it. Politicians like if the local cop is in

216
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,540
 on it then he's the weakest link. Why is he part of your global? Why is he

217
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,300
 banging kids with George Soros in Vienna? It doesn't make sense. Think about this

218
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,020
 stuff for one second please. It gets me... you know the reason why these stories

219
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:42,140
 get me so upset is this is a problem and it makes it into this wacky

220
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,940
 conspiracy and like I said it only gets weird. And when I say it's a problem I

221
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,940
 mean pedophilia is a problem. The story gets even weirder so not only are there

222
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,220
 special forces squads going around kicking down the doors of the local

223
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,940
 ombudsman for the newspaper being like get on the ground get on the ground show

224
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,980
 me your hands. There's another there's another level to it. Sometimes these

225
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,100
 kids that are taken by the Podunk Sheriff of Nebraska they're taken to

226
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,940
 Antarctica and given to draconian reptiles to beat up and get even more

227
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,300
 molested. So apparently in Antarctica there are... oh and I'm not supposed to

228
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,620
 talk about this either. According to Corey Goode this is not supposed to be

229
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,540
 information that is revealed in any way shape or form even though he reveals it

230
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,260
 on his totally public website and he's still alive and charging $110 if you

231
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,740
 want to watch a webinar with him. Anyways in Antarctica there are these huge

232
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,340
 research and development bases to build these giant spaceships the draconians

233
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,460
 which the reptilians live in. They live... Aunt why Antarctica? Why are lizard

234
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,620
 people in the ice? I don't know. Why aren't they in Brazil which is like equally dense?

235
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,180
 But anyways they're in Antarctica for some reason lizards in the ice because

236
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,300
 those things go so well together and they're building these giant spaceships

237
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,580
 and sometimes they bring kids they ship kids all the way from you know Iowa

238
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,900
 that's where all those missing kids are going they're putting them on planes and

239
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,300
 flying would probably releasing chemtrails as they fly across the globe

240
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:18,940
 to land in Antarctica to be disembarked and then aliens beat them up and make

241
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,860
 them slaves I don't know. I like to think at some point the special forces are

242
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,940
 going to be here and they're gonna say if you want to kill a serpent cut off its

243
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,820
 head and then they like go to Antarctica and assault these huge bases but I mean

244
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,620
 it's not going to because it's all made up you know I just it boggles my mind

245
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,660
 sometimes like I can get when someone who has a blog and they write something

246
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,660
 completely ridiculous and you're like okay you know whatever when someone has

247
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:56,780
 an entire organization dedicated to spreading arguably false ideas it's

248
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,860
 just mind-boggling and to end the cap this I think that's that's the same way

249
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,580
 I look at Alex Jones I think he's just an entertainer I think this core good

250
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,740
 guy is an entertainer I don't think he was ever captured by the US Air Force I

251
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,140
 don't think he ever had telepathic visions from an alien I don't think that

252
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,820
 there's top-secret kill squads moving through the United States shooting

253
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:23,300
 pedophiles I think that there are if hard-working investigators shutting down

254
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,100
 pedophile rings constantly and more pop-up and I think the government this

255
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,580
 government is doing a good-faith effort in shutting down human trafficking I do

256
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,940
 think those things are true and those are interesting stories don't add

257
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,580
 reptilians into it just tell me I think the story itself that we've had massive

258
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,340
 human trafficking arrests in the past year and we're making a good-faith effort

259
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,740
 and we're changing the laws that if you are involved in this we are going to

260
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,100
 hurt you legally and financially we will shut you down I think that's

261
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:02,300
 interesting you don't have to add space aliens into it or hit squads that are

262
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,340
 killing low-level pedophiles and other people like Barry what a Junies like I

263
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,140
 just couldn't stand looking at that son of a bitch one more time like I don't

264
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,100
 know I I think the I think the story of Sandy Hook is interesting in and of

265
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,700
 itself it's tragic you don't have to add this conspiracy stuff to it I just

266
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,900
 think that this idea that the world is not already completely messed up and

267
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,300
 has a bunch of evil in it and I have to add space aliens and telepathy and

268
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:41,500
 starships and stargates and all of that stuff I think it's just a little I I

269
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,020
 think it's disingenuous because I honestly think that if Corey Good wrote

270
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,220
 a book about America has a pedophile problem here are the stats here are some

271
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,420
 witness accounts here are some victim accounts here's a couple of words from

272
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,660
 the perpetrators and you know why they did it or how they feel now here's some

273
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,620
 you know we'll talk to these investigators that book is not going to

274
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,780
 sell as well as book after book after book of aliens are in my brain and

275
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,300
 they're eating your children you're not going to be able to pay a hundred and

276
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,820
 ten dollars for a webinar with Corey Good talking about real-life events so he

277
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,740
 just makes stuff up and I think that's the trap that Alex Jones fell into I

278
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,940
 think he probably did honestly believe that 9/11 was an inside job and as time

279
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,940
 progressed the theories got even weirder and weirder and eventually it catches up

280
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,460
 with you because you're stopped being a journalist and you start becoming an

281
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,500
 entertainer and you become a caricature of yourself so yeah I mean I think that

282
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,100
 is the same thing with what happened with Alex Jones I think that it's easier

283
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:56,100
 to sell a fantastic story you may believe in it at first or you may not but

284
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,780
 what happens is it starts to sell very well if I start doing videos let's say

285
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,460
 I do a video series where I talk about how cryptids are invading the national

286
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,660
 parks and those videos and those podcasts get download multiple multiple times my

287
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,260
 first inclination is going to make more of those and eventually as content starts

288
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,380
 to dry up I'm gonna start making it up because that's how I make money I don't

289
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,820
 make any money off the show but you get where I'm coming from you start off with

290
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:34,500
 a conspiracy that you genuinely believe in and people respond to it you make

291
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,540
 money and you get used to that money and you got to start making more money I

292
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,140
 don't think I personally again don't know much about Alex Jones other than what

293
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,260
 I've read I don't he doesn't cross me from what I read back in the day

294
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,420
 especially he doesn't cross me someone who's genuinely a racist person or a

295
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,540
 homophobic person but if during the time when people were talking a lot about the

296
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,020
 invasion of Europe and refugees and all of that coming in the West he starts

297
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,320
 making more videos because he's getting more views because he's supporting that

298
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,060
 viewpoint and eventually he just started saying stuff that maybe he didn't even

299
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,500
 believe in but it was getting him views I don't think Corey Good actually believes

300
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,780
 reptiles are living in Antarctica I mean if he does I guess more power to him

301
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,980
 but that's nutty and my question is if he's revealing this information that's

302
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,980
 never supposed to be revealed why was I able to find his website on Google which

303
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:35,780
 is controlled as we all know by the pedophile draconian Illuminati Alliance
