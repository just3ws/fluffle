1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 We've all heard the saying snitches get stitches, but in the country of Malta, snitches get

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,780
 a monument built to them.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,340
 And then we travel to Ohio to meet a haunted VW bug that has one mission.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:37,020
 Not teenagers from having sex today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:52,460
 And before we get into that, let's go ahead and introduce our Thanksgiving livestream

6
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,260
 show financially I totally understand just helps spread the word about the show

7
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,820
 that also really really helps out a lot now Allison's wake is bringing us in

8
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,160
 Ally sat down this big giant box of beef jerky and I'm gonna eat it all I

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,480
 actually just broke fast I took a 48 our fast that I just broke before doing

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,760
 the podcast I wanted to do 72 hours but the other part of my crazy days I got

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,980
 prescribed all of these steroids for this tooth issue I'm having so I don't

12
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,940
 know a ton about steroids but I do know you can't take them on an empty

13
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,300
 stomach so I did break fast at 48 hours and the reason why I'm telling you guys

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,020
 about this I'm flexing on you guys it's a little bit of a brag but I would like

15
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,100
 you guys to try fasting now there's a lot of health benefits to it and stuff

16
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,220
 on you know you guys know me I'm not a big health nut that's probably why he

17
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,740
 constantly needs steroids for my body to keep functioning and I'm not a big

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,520
 health nut this is the reason why I fast one I figure it is personal

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,080
 endurance and I like being able to brag I can go two days without eating but

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,600
 secondly that's what you brag about you have a hit podcast you have a hit

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
 podcast and that's what you're going around telling people I think about it

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,920
 this way alien drop ships appear in the sky people are blowing up world leaders

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
 please please kill the populace not me I'm famous all these like alien foot

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,820
 soldiers are walking through the streets just blasted dudes I will not have to

25
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,940
 eat for two days like I can go at least two days I was out walking I did all my

26
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,020
 normal stuff I was going to work I'm walking everywhere I walked down to the

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,340
 Walmart to get my prescription all that stuff if I would be able to go two days

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,860
 without eating and I think most people wouldn't and when I say most people I

29
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,820
 mean most people are like the modern world I know there's a lot of parts of

30
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,780
 the planet where they don't eat every day but you need to be prepared you need

31
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,920
 to be prepared when President Joe Biden begs for the aliens not to kill him that

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,520
 may happen so if you're not this is actually like I think Alex Jones is

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,880
 always trying to sell you supplements I'm trying to sell you nothing literally

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,120
 don't do anything if your diet allows it obviously I don't want to be get

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,000
 accused of killing a bunch of people a diabetes people or something if you can't

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,160
 go two days without fasting medically don't don't don't die please but if you

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,660
 won't kill you try it I always think it's interesting to see what the human

38
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,180
 body can do what your human body can do there's my tummy rumbling so I don't

39
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,580
 know if the microphone picked it up the microphone is sensitive if you hear lots

40
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,540
 of noises that's probably what it is but let's see if you can do it maybe start

41
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,540
 off with just a 24-hour fast but dude because when those aliens start coming

42
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,020
 when the zombies invade or maybe it'll just be something lame like a civil war

43
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,300
 or something and the tornado boo think about it right now if something bad

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,400
 happened I wouldn't be immediately looking for food which is a good thing

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
 because I've stated several times on this podcast pretty much from like episode

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,600
 seven I'm willing to eat other humans if my back is to the wall so now knowing

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,480
 that I can go at least two days to active days to new in my normal routine

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,080
 days when no food means if you and I are ever trapped in a scenario I will not

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,280
 eat you for two days

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,580
 Allison's is super nervous they're bringing in even more beef jerky I don't know

51
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,060
 Allison's you're looking pretty good Ali I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,300
 to the dead rabbit robot we're gonna leave behind dead rabbit command we're

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,860
 gonna row all the way out to Malta splash splash rowing all the way out

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,780
 there long-time listeners of dead rabbit radio know that dead rabbit radio is the

55
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,780
 number one science podcast in El Salvador from time to time someone else

56
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,680
 some real science podcast gets rid of us not just up the top but generally we're

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
 at least on the top five but a lot of times we're the number one science

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,760
 podcast in El Salvador another bizarre flex but I'll take it well recently the

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,120
 country of Malta has jumped up and for a while I was the number one science

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,600
 podcast in Malta so I was like okay I already gave my El Salvador bros some

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 respect by doing a story about a man who had sex with a donkey making a little

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,980
 donkey baby what can I give to my Malta minions what can I give them is there

63
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,540
 anything going on in Malta that fits the theme of this show we are now in Malta

64
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,300
 specifically we're in the town of Saint Julian's and it's about like the mid

65
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,620
 1700s so get on your old timey clothes like your pantaloons and like your big

66
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,620
 old hat everything super rule and like itchy and stuff and we're walking down

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,860
 the streets of Saint Julian's and take my shirt off because I'm itching too much

68
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,060
 we're walking around and in between San Juan not San Juan San Juan and a place

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,600
 called Berquerara there's there's a two different neighborhoods there's like

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
 this road going in between those two places and one day there's this dude

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,560
 just sitting on the street kind of just hanging out reading a newspaper where

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,000
 newspapers around at 1700 and there's like wood carvings of like people like

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,440
 herding cows and eating wheat whatever made the news back in the 1700s and this

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,620
 dude where so this guy reading the newspaper we're gonna call him Tommy so

75
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,180
 Tommy's sitting there and he's reading this newspaper and a guy comes running

76
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:08,060
 by oh no oh no oh no oh no and Tommy's like what what in the world was that and

77
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,020
 he sees this guy kind of running and he ducks down an alley Tommy goes on it's

78
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,900
 kind of weird but let me go back to reading this giant wood carving and then a

79
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,220
 couple minutes later this other guy's kind of like jogging jogging down the

80
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,120
 road and he sees Tommy reading these wood carvings and he goes hey pardon me sir

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,480
 pardon me sorry to interrupt your your news reading but did you happen to see

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,680
 some dude run by and Tommy thinks about it he looks down the street and he goes

83
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,320
 yeah yeah yeah there was some guy like just kind of like distraught look like

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,480
 he was in a lot of trouble and the dude standing up his eyes go from side to

85
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,720
 side he's like trouble I don't know what you're talking about you know where he

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 went you know where this man went Tommy goes yeah yeah he went down the street

87
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,940
 a bit and then he turned left going down that alleyway the gentleman goes well

88
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,820
 thank you very much for your service sir I will let you get back to reading the

89
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,300
 paper the next day Tommy wakes up oh he's milking cows and eating wheat and

90
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,860
 then he gets his picture carved into the newspaper the most exciting man in

91
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,380
 Malta that day and he's reading the newspaper and he turns and it says

92
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:17,740
 murder he's like ah and it says a man was murdered in between San Juan in

93
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,040
 Burkara down this alleyway and he's like oh my god oh my god I can't believe what

94
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,760
 happened any pieces it together he realized which you realized he snitched

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,200
 the dude out this guy was running for his life and he's told this other dude

96
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,560
 where he's at and and the dude got stabbed to death in this alleyway and he's

97
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,880
 like bleeding out and stuff like that he's like any time now why Tommy didn't

98
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,280
 hear the man getting brutally murdered down the street I don't know there's

99
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,180
 some questions I have about the story but this story is so famous in Malta

100
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,420
 that not only did they build a giant monument you know in America at least

101
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,140
 when there's a car accident they'll put like a little cross in the road a little

102
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,140
 wooden cross and teddy bears bite and stuff like that it's like that but it's

103
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,060
 it's made of stone it's permanent it's about 15 feet tall at the top is a

104
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,120
 crucifix is this giant pillar and even today people put like flowers by people

105
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,120
 stop and use it as this monument it's called Ratch Mock Ratch you smash Mott

106
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,040
 smash now if you are one of my listeners from Malta you can go ahead and

107
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,480
 correct me because I can guarantee there's some weird letters in there

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,520
 there's some X's in there I don't know if the X is silent but what this means in

109
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,500
 English is this this pillar is called I saw I didn't see and I heard I didn't

110
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,740
 hear so basically keep your mouth shut if you see something say nothing the

111
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,620
 month the story is very famous the monuments very famous and at one point

112
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,340
 you kind of think maybe this is an urban legend maybe this pillar was here and

113
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,580
 someone made up the story behind it no this is very well known in Malta

114
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,720
 culture there's actually a pop song about it written by a dude named Tony

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,320
 Camilleri and the name of the song was I don't see I don't hear and it just

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,040
 basically is like here let me read you some of the lyrics I live in punishment

117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,560
 I live because I did not control my tongue I didn't see it I didn't hear it

118
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,760
 this is the warning written on the wall I didn't see it I didn't hear it see what

119
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,580
 you see hear what you hear don't talk to anyone don't talk to anyone I don't

120
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,860
 think a rapper could write stronger snitches get stitches there and he

121
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,980
 didn't get the stitches the other dude got stitches it's weird because the

122
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,420
 moral of the story is keep your mouth shut which generally in societies like

123
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,860
 in America and Britain they have that whole if you see something say something

124
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,380
 this is the opposite right but it is ingrained into that culture if you see

125
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,680
 something maybe just maybe just don't tell anyone really fascinating story and

126
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,240
 it's what I was looking up like true crime in Malta this was one of the ones

127
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,080
 that popped up a lot the murder of this man and the lesson is keep your keep your

128
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,760
 mouth shut for me I grew up in bad neighborhoods right snitches get stitches

129
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
 wasn't just a phrase it was an actual thing you have to worry about and I

130
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,280
 always saw it like this because it was so funny because my friends are like dude

131
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,960
 we just can't tell when you can tell what your view is on law enforcement my

132
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,800
 view always was there been time ever once this dude took this little girl

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,900
 hostage and they were doing this hostage situation it was up where was this

134
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,680
 it was in art and fair I think out in Sacramento and the cops had surrounded

135
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,520
 the apartment complex they were there for two days everyone was watching it on

136
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,120
 the news and I go you know what those cops must be awfully thirsty so I went

137
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,740
 and got like two or three 24 packs of soda I got two 24 packs of soda and a

138
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,680
 24 pack of water and I pulled up to the line of where all the police were and I

139
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
 went to go give them the sodas and the officer goes oh I appreciate that he I

140
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,480
 think he took some waters because I appreciate that but it's we we solved

141
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,320
 it everything's good and I was like okay and then as I'm driving home the radio

142
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,040
 was like the police what they did was they got a sniper and they were able to

143
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,880
 have all the infrared stuff to see through the wall I mean he was holding

144
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,680
 like a three-year-old girl hostage for like two days and the sniper shot a

145
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,360
 bullet right through the wall and blew his head off right in front of the kid I

146
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,740
 mean the kid was gonna be traumatized either way but they shot him through the

147
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,500
 wall they could see him through the wall and so yeah they didn't need sodas

148
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,380
 they're all going home to their families so on that like nobody's pro holding

149
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,180
 three-year-old kids hostage but there's other I had other interactions with the

150
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,940
 police that in we're far less friendly overall so my my goal my always goal is

151
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,420
 this is that I think it's wrong to snitch if you're part of a criminal

152
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,020
 enterprise and you get caught and snitching reduces your sentence you're

153
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,080
 gonna get stitches if you're part of a criminal enterprise and you're making

154
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,320
 money off of that criminal enterprise but they start blowing you off or they

155
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,640
 start sleeping with your girlfriend or something dumb and you snitch on them

156
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,600
 snitches get stitches that's on you if you're a civilian if you're outside of

157
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,400
 an organization or you have nothing to do with the money making you're driving

158
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,560
 home and you see a crime that to me was never snitches get stitches now that

159
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,280
 depended on the dependent on the particular gangster who was involved in

160
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,020
 that situation for me snitches get stitches is that's where you're working

161
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,820
 with them there are other times I've obviously dealt with law enforcement

162
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,460
 because I see someone doing this someone doing that the web is a probably a couple

163
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,540
 weeks ago some dudes are beating some woman up and some dude some random guy

164
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,900
 outside of bar I called the cops I'm 45 years old I'm not gonna go out there and

165
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,900
 and tussle with a bunch of 19 year olds a bunch of drunk 19 year olds in the

166
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,820
 middle of the street I'm not gonna do that I walk outside these guys are beating

167
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,860
 up this dude and this girl the dude and the girl are holding their own honestly

168
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,880
 and I just do hello yeah this is me know me the cops know me as Jason hey I got

169
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
 a fight under my name was getting in their car but I don't know and then I

170
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,480
 talked to the girls for a bit and that was that so I don't consider that snitches

171
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,680
 get stitches that's something where I think you could easily say you see

172
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,760
 something say something like that it's always a tricky thing though I also know

173
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,440
 I've never been this has never happened to me but I also know of people who have

174
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,740
 snitched and they did not work out well for him I actually know of people I got

175
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,940
 to be careful how much they talk about this but I actually know of people whose

176
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,460
 family members snitched and they had to like quit their job and move away like

177
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,840
 I'm hanging out with this dude and a relative of his snitched and this dude

178
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,220
 was like hey dude I'll see you later or never again like I have to leave the

179
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,240
 state I was like hey what's going on and he told me this crazy story about how

180
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,480
 his buddy or how his relative did this and then went to the police about this

181
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,480
 and then him and his family were in danger to the point that they had to

182
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,920
 leave people were trying to actively kill them like actively kill them because

183
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
 something that is really so it's always an interesting I mean when you're on the

184
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,040
 outside is interesting I hope that friend of mine is doing fine but yeah that was

185
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,260
 years ago that was years ago so yes niches get stitches is a famous famous

186
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,740
 phrase and Malta it's the opposite keep your mouth shut it's just an

187
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,860
 interesting story it's keep your mouth shut and that's that's not what your

188
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,340
 government would want I'm surprised this story is still around it seems counter

189
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,420
 intuitive that the government would want to keep this story around but

190
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,620
 Allison's I'm gonna give you the keys of the carbonic copter we're leaving

191
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,460
 behind Malta we're headed all the way out to Ohio

192
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,440
 and as we're headed out there I want to do a really really quick dead rabbit

193
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,840
 recommends speaking of alien evasions this is what kind of why I'm singing about

194
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,440
 alien evasions I watched the dopest movie the I've watched a lot of great

195
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,240
 movies recently this one I just watched like two days ago and it jumped to the

196
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,600
 top of my list of movies I wanted to talk about it's a Netflix exclusive it's a

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,840
 Netflix exclusive movie starring Michael Pina who's been in like everything he's

198
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,280
 he's just this great character actor he's been in a ton of movies it's called

199
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,220
 extinction and it's I love alien invasion movies when they're done right

200
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,500
 same thing I love about zombie movies or pandemic movies because it's about the

201
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,020
 end of the world asteroids coming down all this type of stuff and how people

202
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,360
 are dealing with the end of the world and it's a great alien invasion movie with

203
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,460
 a twist Michael Pina is kind of like a dad on the cusp of a failing marriage

204
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,940
 his kids don't like him he works at like some CERN type laboratory as like an

205
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:39,120
 engineer and he begins to have dreams visions of an alien invasion he keeps

206
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,940
 seeing people just getting shot in the streets and all these drop ships coming

207
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,760
 down in the cities and people just getting gunned down and he's at work and

208
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,960
 he has a vision of himself like beating someone to death with his hands he's

209
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 having these horrible visions about the future and his wife is just like listen

210
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,340
 you're just going crazy please please get this treated me and the kids can't

211
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,260
 deal with this anymore so he goes to the psychiatrist's office and while he's in

212
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,700
 the office there's another patient sitting next to him there and like in

213
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,140
 the waiting room and the other dude turns to Michael Pina and goes you're not

214
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:19,780
 crazy I see the aliens - I've seen the visions and they're coming and you're

215
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,580
 like oh dude this movie's really dope because not only is it a really tight

216
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,320
 alien invasion movie it goes it's like an hour and a half long but it moves so

217
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,200
 quickly not only is it a really good alien invasion movie you have the

218
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,760
 mystery is how does he know the future and I'll tell you right now as I was

219
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,040
 watching I was like oh I hope it's not that this is also a vision and he's gonna

220
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,120
 wake up and he's like oh now I know what's going to happen like invasion from

221
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,600
 Mars or something like that no it's not a twist that it's all a dream you have

222
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,480
 this really cool alien invasion movie where they are gunning people down on

223
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,260
 the streets it is like block by block alien invasion mixed with the mystery

224
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,740
 how does he know how did he know this was going to happen really really tight

225
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,460
 movie reminded me of a short science fiction story that I would have read

226
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,380
 some Saturday afternoon when I was a teenager like I it's such a good sci-fi

227
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,980
 adventure it's actually quite grim I don't know if I'd call it an adventure

228
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,660
 but Dead Rabbit recommends extinction on Netflix really really recommend that

229
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,200
 movie I said recently that the exports been putting out a lot of quality stuff

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,560
 and they have the guy who's writing the story had an uncle when he was growing up

231
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:33,040
 he had a great uncle who would always tell him about local urban legends and

232
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,320
 where we're at is in Buckeye Lake Ohio and he goes Michael tell me stuff like

233
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,680
 Crybaby bridge you know that's very typical story we've covered stuff like

234
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,280
 that on the show before the grass man of Ohio which is basically like a big foot

235
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,740
 a type of creature all these all these local urban legends and there was one

236
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:58,140
 story that this poster had heard that intrigued him for years and he actually

237
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,280
 tried finding more information on it he could never get any more info on it he

238
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,540
 goes I kind of think that my great uncle might have made it up but I don't know he

239
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,060
 goes it's so weird that it I can't find any proof of any of it so maybe my uncle

240
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,680
 made it up but he also knew all about all these other urban legends why would he

241
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,760
 make this one up if all the other ones can be traced to something back in the

242
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,600
 late 1950s in the town of mountain Vernon a bright blue Volkswagen Beetle

243
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:37,160
 comes driving into town and inside this beetle was a father will call him Jake

244
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,280
 and his daughter will call her Alyssa and they're driving down the road the

245
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,780
 relationship between Jake and Alyssa was so stereotypical is so cliche but it is

246
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,220
 realistic he was a devout Christian man who ruled the house right a man's home

247
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,460
 is his castle and everyone has to do what he says and he follows the one boss

248
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,740
 the big boss in the sky he is a devout Christian she is a rebellious teenager

249
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 she wants to dress how she dresses and listen to the music what she wants to

250
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,560
 listen to he's like I want to listen to checkberry he's like oh that's so

251
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,440
 rebellious and she wants to date who she wants to date now the one person that

252
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,880
 united this family is passed away this is like a real life the righteous

253
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,360
 gemstones they no longer have this unifying force you just have two people

254
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,600
 that are on different paths but the rebellious girl is living with her dad

255
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:34,040
 and my house my rules Jake always said so they would constantly fight

256
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,140
 she was gonna follow the rules but she also couldn't afford to get her own

257
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,100
 place they're constantly fighting it was a house full of torment and it came to

258
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:49,380
 a head when the father one day found out that Alyssa was dating a 20-something

259
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,420
 year-old man he flips out Jake totally flips out because listen you know this

260
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,420
 is a recipe for disaster the dude's not gonna stick around at best he's just

261
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,420
 gonna break your heart at worst he's gonna knock you up it's gonna be this

262
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,480
 huge thing so Jake forbids his daughter from ever seeing this guy again and

263
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,360
 Alyssa in the throes of teenage love doesn't care doesn't listen to the dad

264
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,840
 she needs to keep being with this dude right which is the dumb decision but

265
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,960
 again very very cliche because it happens all the time Jake actually thinks

266
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,040
 that it's solved though he think he actually got through to his daughter but

267
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,400
 one day when he was rummaging through her room apparently he finds a pair of

268
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,980
 men's boxers kind of stuffed away in the back of her closet so Alyssa's at

269
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,460
 school and and Jake is enraged he can't believe that this is a crime even in the

270
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,020
 1950s I'm pretty sure you weren't allowed to be 25 years old dating a 15-year-old

271
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,380
 I'm not for sure but I hope it was against the law he decides to confront

272
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,220
 this boyfriend so while Alyssa's at school he jumps in his bright blue beetle

273
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,280
 and Jake is driving through town going to this boy's house he's going to

274
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,960
 probably kill this guy for sleeping with his teenage daughter but he doesn't get

275
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,720
 the opportunity to he doesn't get the sweet sweet satisfaction of strangling

276
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,040
 a man who did you wrong on his way to this boyfriend's house he blows through

277
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:24,240
 a stoplight the truck slams into him and he dies at the scene

278
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:32,520
 police show up taking reports ambulance shows up they're like what was

279
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,400
 supposed to do he's dead I don't know we're throwing the gurney so they put

280
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,180
 him in the gurney and then the tow truck shows up eat eat eat and they take their

281
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,700
 wreckage of the blue beetle to like a holding area and then eventually to a

282
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,380
 scrapyard where they're like put it in the box thing it's not really good

283
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,380
 people who work at the scrapyard they don't know what anything's called the

284
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,120
 workers are like what is the box thing they just tumble the car around till

285
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,840
 they get to the compactor that's what I meant that makes more sense and the blue

286
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,600
 beetle is getting crushed until it's now like a little cube and hoisted up put

287
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,040
 the cube put the cube on the box they're like dude quick calling stuff boxes

288
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,240
 everything's a box stuff gets turned into boxes here you're fired you can't work

289
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,540
 here anymore so the blue beetle is crushed to bits and the story of Alyssa

290
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,820
 we never really know what happens to her did she stay with her boyfriend was

291
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,300
 she she overcome with emotion at the loss of her father does she decide to

292
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,180
 dedicate her life to Christ we don't know any of this stuff because that would

293
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,180
 be an involved character development and human interest instead the story goes

294
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,380
 like this a couple weeks later these two teenagers are making out in the woods

295
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:53,800
 near Mount Vernon mm-hmm oh Terry you're so sexy oh thank you Bruce I'm they're

296
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,640
 kissing and they see some headlights in the distance now like oh maybe that's

297
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
 the cops coming to break us up and then they go wait a second no because unless

298
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,080
 the cops started driving Volkswagen bugs there's not the cops and they were

299
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,920
 looking at this blue Volkswagen Beetle sitting on the road and then it starts

300
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,580
 going and it starts driving on the road towards them now I used to have a

301
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,780
 Volkswagen bug they're very iconic cars so they're very fuel efficient they are

302
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,900
 not they are not knowing for their speediness though but these teenagers

303
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,220
 claim that they were chased through the forest through the forest no paved road

304
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:37,100
 the car begins to chase them through the forest yeah this Volkswagen bug is like

305
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,660
 going like driving over roots and it's a little goalies and stuff like that but

306
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,480
 they report to the police we were making out and a car chased us through the

307
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,000
 woods and the police are like okay that's weird we'll put that down on our

308
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,880
 paperwork but hope that doesn't happen to you again I'm trying to get it a little

309
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,040
 bit more than that they're like what attempted kidnapping will all write that

310
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,640
 down but hopefully it doesn't happen again stories start to spread around town

311
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,880
 of teenagers in their bedroom oh my parents are out of town Johnny you want

312
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,340
 to get to third base he's like well that's really aggressive do you know what

313
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,640
 third base actually means she's like I do I do and she starts undressing do you

314
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,860
 guys you guys know what third base is it's it's up there called third base

315
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,500
 for a reason as she begins undressing she begins taking off her bra and then she's

316
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,780
 trying to show off her headlights but instead headlights illuminate the room

317
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,540
 from outside ah it's blinding and the guy would look out the window and there

318
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,640
 would be a bright blue Volkswagen bug sitting in the street it's headlights

319
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,000
 shining on the teenagers ah cut it out man cut it out I'm trying to have sex

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,960
 with this chick it starts happening all over town teenagers start saying whenever

321
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,720
 I start taking my clothes off before I'm about to make some whoopee headlights

322
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,600
 appear through the window and I look outside and there's this bright blue

323
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,680
 Volkswagen bug teenagers start reporting the blue bug following them around

324
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,380
 town whether they're driving with their snuggle bunny or just walking down the

325
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,440
 street holding hands

326
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,940
 bright blue Volkswagen bug behind them and then there are some that say that this

327
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,620
 car is not a simple voyeur it's not just tracking down these people or slowly

328
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,780
 pursuing them through the forest as fast as a Volkswagen bug can drive through a

329
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,620
 forest people start to realize that teens are going missing in the town of

330
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,640
 mountain Vernon now some of them you could chalk up to runaway some of them

331
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,840
 you could chalk up to them just going on getting tired of their home joining the

332
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,680
 military whatever but there are some who say that the blue beetle itself was

333
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:52,040
 kidnapping and killing young teenage lovers the story is known as the sex

334
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,240
 hating Volkswagen of Mount Vernon Ohio it's interesting because the way that

335
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,340
 the story was presented to us again was I don't know if this story is true but

336
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,420
 all these other stories my great uncle told me I was able to find verification

337
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,420
 of it would be one thing if he was like and that was the time I stopped the

338
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,580
 leprechaun from ending World War two if he was making stuff up you think you'd

339
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,980
 have more made-up stuff so the legend may be true in the sense that the great

340
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,060
 uncle didn't make it up but they that he had simply heard it as an urban legend

341
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,800
 himself but even going one step further in the world of the paranormal this

342
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,320
 makes sense this is something that could happen in the world of the paranormal

343
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,480
 because it's really fascinating because what we have is a vengeful spirit the

344
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,600
 father who was trying really what he was trying to do yeah he was probably a

345
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,200
 little overbearing but at the end of the day he was trying to save his daughter

346
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,880
 she was in a relationship with a much much older man who was taking advantage

347
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,620
 of her right so despite that he might have come down a little little heavy

348
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,660
 and he wasn't gonna murder the guy we have a man who feels like he has to do

349
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,220
 this to take care of his family and he dies in that rage he dies in that moment

350
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:12,180
 so a vengeful spirit a wraith totally fits with ghost lore as we know it and

351
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,740
 if the car itself the mechanical structure of the car was possessed by a

352
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,840
 ghost we see that as well not necessarily with cars but we see dolls possessed by

353
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 ghost and paintings possessed by ghost I have a friend who says that her lamp is

354
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,800
 possessed by a ghost it's not really her lamp she bought it from a thrift store

355
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 but the point is is that the idea of a ghost possessing an inanimate object is

356
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,240
 very very accepted within the paranormal lore but remember this car was

357
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,840
 destroyed this is a really interesting story because we have a vengeful spirit

358
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,020
 taking the form of the car it was almost like he had infused the physical

359
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:56,660
 being of this vehicle with his rage so when he returned to earth as the spirit

360
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,420
 it wasn't him just walking around town which to be honest wouldn't be super

361
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,340
 intimidating I mean okay if I was trying to have sex in the woods with some hot

362
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,060
 chick and some dude starts walking towards me I'm gonna run I'm gonna get

363
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,100
 her take her take her and I run away but it'd be far more scary right to be

364
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:20,000
 chased by a car remember that old movie Wraith was kind of about that was

365
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,940
 about the guy who died in the car accident and then drove around running

366
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,840
 people over it's really a movie who was in it like Richard Greco or Robert Downey

367
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,600
 Jr. or somebody anyways you did have recommends Wraith I saw it when I was

368
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,900
 12 maybe it's the holds up the idea of a ghost taking the form of a car chasing

369
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,720
 people down this all fits with the lore so while the story may have been made up

370
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,420
 it's possible that it was real and when we go back to the 1950s if this was

371
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:51,140
 something that teenagers were reporting obviously it sounds really really dumb

372
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,380
 so no parent is going to take this seriously and actually now they think

373
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,900
 about it they wouldn't be reporting this right like the couple in the woods

374
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,740
 would have told the authorities because they were almost killed but no one's

375
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,540
 gonna be like mom mom you won't believe what happened when me and Johnny were

376
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,820
 trying to have sex last night she's like wait wait what you wouldn't you would

377
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,400
 this would be spreading from teenager to teenager that's how the story would be

378
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,360
 being told so it's possible that this poster is great uncle was a teenager at

379
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,040
 this time and was hearing these stories it wouldn't be something you would

380
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,920
 announce to the world because all of these kids are doing something that they

381
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,880
 shouldn't be doing right trying to have sex I mean I'm not saying sex is bad

382
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,400
 but obviously teenagers the longer you can postpone having sex the better off

383
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,360
 you're going to be especially if there's a killer car on the loose so the point is

384
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,900
 is that you could have this phantom in this form of this car stalking the city

385
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,380
 of Mount Vernon trying to stop teenagers from having sex and if we accept the

386
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,060
 story as true and it does fit into Ghost Lore it's possible the VW bug is still

387
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:02,100
 out there Roman these streets if this is a super obscure story it would be one of

388
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,220
 those things it's kind of the plot of it's kind of the plot of Nightmare on Elm

389
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,280
 Street right they erased all knowledge of Freddy Kruger and that was fine for

390
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,000
 about 30 years but then the kids started having dreams about this guy and asking

391
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,200
 who's Freddy Kruger the parents are like oh so it's possible that this legend did

392
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,560
 happen and people just forgot about it it was whispered among teens and then they

393
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,760
 grew up and then they go oh maybe that wasn't real I always do wonder what

394
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,160
 happened to Tiffany she went missing that one day but I don't know go about me

395
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,120
 that's the cop investigating the crime I don't know someone else will figure it

396
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,340
 out everyone moves on with their life but this Volkswagen bug is still out there

397
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:44,620
 looking for teenagers about to have sex trying to scare them off but when that

398
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,580
 fails trying to chase them off and when that fails killing them so next time

399
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,380
 you're driving down the road on the way to your special loved ones house you got

400
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:00,260
 a box of condoms you're very very optimistic you have a box of condoms in

401
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,620
 your glove compartment you're driving over to your special ladies house make

402
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,420
 sure to check in that rear view mirror see if you're being followed look in

403
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,060
 that rear view mirror because there might be a set of headlights behind you but

404
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,360
 it's just the mailman for some reason he's delivering mail see real late a

405
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,440
 night you know he passes you and go whoo and then you get to her house and you

406
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,980
 bring in a shopping bag full of condoms and you set him down on the table honey

407
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,460
 I'm home and she's like ooh and then you see some headlights outside your window

408
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,660
 and you're like ah you look out and it's it's old farmer John on his tractor just

409
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:43,440
 going by you're like what that's weird tractor noises and then you go to the

410
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,820
 bedroom with your lovely lady and you're like hey you know what third basis I

411
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,460
 heard on her podcast and run entirely for sure and she goes take me and she

412
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,100
 throws herself down on the bed and right when you get on top of your lovely

413
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,740
 lady to make sweet sweet passionate love to her you hear the closet door creak

414
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:10,140
 open you turn and the cat walks out of the closet you're like stop listening to

415
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,140
 this paranormal podcast before I have sex with my girlfriend obviously I'm very

416
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,460
 very paranoid and you were able to make sweet love with your girlfriend and

417
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,300
 everything's great and you go through the bag and then you go to the store to buy

418
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,100
 some more condoms and then you run out of those and then eventually it's Dawn

419
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,020
 is three weeks later and you've been late for work you've been fired and you're

420
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,500
 walking out to your car and you're driving home with a big smile on your

421
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,540
 face and you see another set of headlights behind you and you're like oh

422
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:42,140
 that's probably just the mailman or the tractor or the cat but instead it's a

423
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:49,020
 bright blue Volkswagen bug you might not be a teenager you might not be having

424
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,700
 illicit sex with someone you shouldn't be with but to a vengeful spirit from

425
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,420
 beyond the grave those are just trivialities you have now run afoul of

426
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:07,260
 the sex-hating Volkswagen bug there's nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide

427
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:14,580
 it will get you it will take you away to the bad place soon you find yourself

428
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,660
 freezing cold in a junkyard made out of desiccated human remains you're like

429
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,620
 wow this escalated fast and as the compactor starts to press in on you

430
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:33,500
 no no I want to live longer let me get laid at least 10 more times and as the

431
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,820
 very last thing that pops is your eyeball you have one eyeball and right

432
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,940
 before it pops you see a Volkswagen bug it's like Lightning McQueen it's

433
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,580
 operating the gears of the compactor with its wheel hands it's like gotta go

434
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,540
 fast and then the eyeball gets squished and you're totally dead you became the

435
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,700
 latest victim of the sex-hating Volkswagen bug if it existed it still

436
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,300
 exists if it was a vengeful ghost trying to prevent people from having sex

437
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,740
 it's still continuing that mission to this day the only question is will you

438
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:17,380
 become its next victim or will you or will you have stayed from sex forever
