1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 A mysterious videotape is delivered to the US Department of Defense, and after they watch

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,560
 it, they know the truth.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,560
 And then we take a look at a new conspiracy theory that's just popped up in the last

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:20,000
 few months, who is taking children's movie trailers and editing in acts of violence.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
 And then we meet a farmer who's been dealing with a rash of cattle mutilations.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,720
 He is intent on finding the culprit and punishing them, but nothing could prepare him when he

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,400
 comes face to face with the beast responsible today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun doing whatever you're doing.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,480
 I hope you guys are on the right path making the right decisions.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,920
 First off, let's go ahead and meet today's legacy Patreon, a man who always makes the

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,480
 best decisions.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,800
 Everyone give a round of applause to Nathan, he's all walking in that braggart.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,960
 He's talking about all his good decisions.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,240
 Nathan, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it, it's fine.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,120
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,360
 Now Nathan, you heard that we have a slam, bam and episode today.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
 Nathan, I'm going to go and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,440
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed all the way out to the 38th

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 parallel.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:37,560
 In 1996, the US Department of Defense is presented with a VHS tape.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,040
 They're looking at this and they go, who wants to put it in?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,680
 Now the ring wasn't invented, right?

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
 Nobody knew about spooky video cassettes, so they actually had no problem.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,840
 They weren't finding some intern to watch this video tape.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
 They're looking at this video tape and it's written in Korean unsung heroes.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
 I'm like, what?

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 I didn't order this.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
 This wasn't part of my Netflix queue.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 What's this doing here?

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,920
 And the guy who brought it in goes, oh no, no, no, no, no, I probably should have introduced

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 it.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,320
 I probably shouldn't have brought in this tape and just sat down and just go, guess,

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,920
 he goes unsung heroes is a North Korean crime drama, spy thriller.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,800
 And the department of defense is like, okay, I mean, it doesn't, it still doesn't give

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
 us any remation.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
 We know the genre now and the guy's like, oh yeah, I don't know why I paused there.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,000
 I was, I was distracted.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,600
 I should have, he's a really bad agent.

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,440
 They're getting ready to fire him.

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,000
 He goes, this tape, oh, you know what, watch it.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,600
 I don't even think I can figure out the best way to say it.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,960
 Obviously, I can tell you guys are about to fire me.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,640
 So they put in the VHS tape and it's this 20 hour long soap opera slash spy thriller.

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
 They're watching it.

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 He's all eating popcorn.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,240
 He's like, oh, this is my favorite part.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
 No, no, no.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,320
 And the department of defense is like, oh my God, 20 hours.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,280
 This is taking so long.

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
 Wait what?

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,200
 Willis, Willis, get the president on the phone.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,680
 We found them.

57
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,560
 Now let's go back in time, May 28th, 1962.

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
 We're at the 38th parallel.

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,400
 The Korean War had been over since, well, it's not over, but basically the conflict

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
 ceased in 1953.

61
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,800
 So it had been nine years since anything had really popped off.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,920
 On May 28th, 1962, private first class Larry Abshire, he's a 19 year old kid.

63
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,000
 He's getting corn marshals for smoke and weed and you're not supposed to be able to do that,

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 right?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,280
 So he's thinking, oh man, what, I'm probably going to get thrown in the brig and get kicked

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,400
 out of the military and they'll probably wag their fingers at me.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,560
 Or, I mean, all that stuff, I can do all that stuff, slap on the wrist.

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
 Or, and he looks across the 38th parallel.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
 Larry is stationed in South Korea.

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,560
 He's very close to the 38th parallel and he looks wistfully across this landmine-struin

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,120
 area or it could defect to North Korea.

72
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,280
 I mean, how bad could they be?

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
 So he runs through the minefield.

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
 No one chased him.

75
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
 No Americans chased him.

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,080
 They were shocked.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
 They just let him go.

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
 What are you going to do?

79
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,920
 You're like, no, stop, wait for me.

80
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,040
 I want to be thrown into that totalitarian hellhole.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 You just let him go.

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 Well, not even that.

83
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
 They probably knew he was going to step on a landmine at any given point.

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,720
 They watch him run across the DMZ and he disappeared.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,360
 He was the first US soldier to defect to North Korea since the end of the war, which

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
 is interesting.

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,840
 He kept seeing that sentence and I thought, well, who was doing it during the war?

88
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 I mean, I get it.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,040
 A lot of times your government will run propaganda against the enemy, but I think now, 60 years

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,840
 later, we still have a pretty clear picture of how North Korea is.

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,240
 It's not a very fun place to be.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,360
 He was the first soldier to defect after the end of the war, but he wasn't the last.

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,120
 Three other dudes did it.

94
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,000
 One of them was worried about their father-in-law beating them up.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So again, I'm going to run across the minefield.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 One of them was in trouble for forging documents.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,640
 These weren't huge issues, but for whatever reason, they thought, I'm going to try my

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,960
 luck in North Korea.

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,840
 Now they do get across all four of these guys.

100
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,800
 You had James Dresnok, Jerry Wayne Parrish, Charles Robert Jenkins, and then we had Larry,

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,320
 the first one to do it.

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 They all successfully get across the minefield.

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,720
 What happens is, after a couple days, they start broadcasting on the live speakers.

104
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,880
 "Hey guys, it's me.

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
 It's me.

106
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 Good old Jerry Parrish.

107
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
 And you know what?

108
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,360
 I know that I was your favorite.

109
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,160
 People are like, "Who the hell's Jerry Parrish?

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
 We don't know this guy.

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,000
 We used to hang out all the time.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You guys should come over here too and hang out more, man."

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's dope.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 They got like Orange Fanta over here, and they got like, he turns over to his North Korean

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 handlers.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
 He's like, "What else do you have?"

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
 And they're like, "We have cars.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
 They have cars.

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
 You like cars, right?"

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,640
 They got beautiful babes from all over the world.

121
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,960
 They might be slaves.

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,800
 They might be kidnapped victims, but they're from all over the world.

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,760
 Why don't you come across this minefield and join us?

124
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,280
 And these broadcasts are constantly being done.

125
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
 And of course, no one knows.

126
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
 This is like the dumbest thing, right?

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,760
 Everyone knows that this is pure propaganda.

128
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,000
 No one falls for this.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,120
 These broadcasts keep going on for a while, right?

130
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,840
 They're on and they're being used in North Korea to be like, "Look it.

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,000
 That's how bad America is.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,880
 These Yankees were willing to run across these landmines to get here."

133
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,320
 That shows how awful it was.

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,800
 They're like these celebrities in North Korea.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,280
 They're on magazine covers and all this stuff.

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,880
 And that's all true, but after like the glamorous shoot, after they're like, "Jee, jee, jee,"

137
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,080
 the guy's taking pictures and stuff like that.

138
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,680
 And they're like, "Okay, get in your limo."

139
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,560
 And then they walk out and the limo is just a guy with a machine gun and he's pushing

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
 them down the street.

141
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,600
 They're like, "Ah, this is the worst limo I've never been in."

142
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,360
 They all four had to live in a shack.

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,280
 And when they weren't having their pictures taken or at the DMZ doing like recruitment

144
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,600
 tapes, which actually they probably just recorded them, right?

145
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,400
 They probably got super bored, they had to sit in a shack, all four of them.

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
 They didn't know each other before they came over.

147
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
 They did not like each other.

148
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,760
 They're constantly fighting.

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,000
 Which is not something you should do if you're prisoners of war, right?

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,040
 You should try to assemble together, maybe.

151
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,160
 Because the guards are also beating them up and they're like, "Oh man, I haven't gone

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
 beat up that much since this morning when one of my fellow countrymen beat me up."

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,600
 When they weren't getting beaten or doing magazine covers or both at the same time,

154
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,400
 they're like five fashions to wear when you're brutally bruised.

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,000
 When they weren't doing that stuff, they had to constantly study the writings of Kim Il-sung,

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
 the country's founder.

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,600
 They had to do the struggle sessions, which is where they confessed their wrongs.

158
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,880
 And all this stuff, the stuff that we see come out of these dystopian communist governments.

159
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,560
 This captivity goes on and on.

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,040
 And the government doesn't really know what to do with these guys because they are prisoners

161
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,720
 and they are propaganda tools and maybe they'll be useful in the future.

162
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
 So they're trying to keep them happy.

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,920
 They're supplying them with women and then they steal women from other countries and

164
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,720
 supply them with them.

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,120
 It's a pretty horrible story overall when you have women getting kidnapped from Morocco,

166
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,280
 kidnapped from Japan just to be these dudes' wives.

167
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,480
 But what happened is in 1978, North Korea, we talked about this before, we did a whole

168
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,960
 week on North Korea, they loved their film industry.

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,440
 And in 1978, the government decided to make this 20-hour long series about spies in Korea

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,520
 called Unsung Heroes.

171
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,360
 And they go, "Well, we have all these great actors to be the North Koreans and the South

172
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,840
 Koreans because it's about who started the war and the ideas the Americans did.

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,880
 We have all these great actors, but we need some bad guys."

174
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,760
 Just happen to be any Americans around.

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,440
 And they got two of these POWs to be in the movie.

176
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,760
 Charles Jenkins played a devious American who actually masterminded the Korean War.

177
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,640
 And then James Dresnok played a guy named Arthur Cockstudd.

178
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,360
 This is not a forno.

179
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,720
 I don't know why they chose that name.

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
 They had to have known what it meant.

181
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
 Or maybe they didn't.

182
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,600
 Arthur's like, "Oh no, this means bad guy."

183
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,280
 And they're like, "Oh, that's cool."

184
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,960
 He plays a POW camp commander.

185
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,600
 And his role is so popular, like people love the character of Arthur Cockstudd so much

186
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,440
 that when he's walking around town, because he is allowed at this point, like what, 15

187
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,800
 years have passed, he knows all the stuff about Kim O Sung's philosophies.

188
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,440
 They totally believe he's one of them.

189
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
 They're allowed to walk around town.

190
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,800
 People just call him Arthur.

191
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
 People just call him Arthur, which happens over here.

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,640
 I mean, I'm sure Dustin Diamond got called Screech at his funeral.

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,720
 Like at a certain point, everyone's just going to know you by the name of your character.

194
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,360
 But from the time that they escaped over the border, and those broadcasts started being

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,640
 done, which were recorded at a certain point, the US government figured these dudes were

196
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
 dead.

197
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,720
 No idea that they were alive at all.

198
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
 North Korea is a really, really hard country to spy on.

199
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,560
 They had no way to know until 1996 a VHS copy of Unsung Heroes is smuggled out of North

200
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,160
 Korea and the US Department of Defense goes, "Oh, at least two of these guys are still

201
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,660
 alive."

202
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,000
 The story ends depending on your point of view in a pretty depressing way.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
 I mean, if you're a North Korean, it's a happy ending.

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,080
 In 1983, Larry Abshir, he dies of a heart attack.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,320
 And he was buried in North Korea and his tombstone says he was born in Yongyang, which is the

206
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,640
 capital of North Korea.

207
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,680
 In 1998, Jerry Parish dies and he had a wife and kids.

208
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,100
 They are still in North Korea.

209
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,320
 They weren't allowed to leave.

210
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,720
 In 2016, James Dresnok died.

211
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,960
 He also had kids that are in North Korea.

212
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,920
 And this is brilliant, right?

213
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,360
 Jerry Dresnok died.

214
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
 Arthur Kochstead, I wonder if that's on his gravestone.

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,440
 Arthur Kochstead died.

216
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,560
 His children also entered the film industry to play villainous Americans.

217
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,600
 So keeping in the family, Charles Robert Jenkins had the most interesting ending.

218
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,000
 He died in 2017, but before that, his wife was one of the kidnapped Japanese women.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,560
 The North Koreans were constantly kidnapping Japanese women for usually sexual purposes.

220
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,040
 His wife was one of them.

221
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,440
 And the Japanese government found out about this.

222
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
 The North Korea denied it, denied it, denied it.

223
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,640
 But in 2002, they confirmed that they had done it and that they said, okay, we'll give

224
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
 you the Japanese citizens back.

225
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,040
 And because he was married to a Japanese citizen, he actually also got to leave.

226
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,000
 He was the only person who died outside of the country.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,360
 The reason why I want to talk about that story, it went a little longer than I wanted to,

228
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,080
 but I love the idea of lost media.

229
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
 It's what this is.

230
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,960
 You don't even know this show existed.

231
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,440
 And it was proof that these men were still alive.

232
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,000
 And how often, when you talk about lost media, a lot of times you're like, oh, Nickelodeon

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,040
 produced a scary show and everyone who watched it that night thought it was too spooky.

234
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,320
 So they never aired it again.

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,800
 I mean, that's interesting.

236
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
 We're not discounting that.

237
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
 That's very interesting.

238
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,860
 But imagine Nickelodeon made a show, Nickelodeon made a show and had four real life missing

239
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,560
 kids in it.

240
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,640
 The casting director turned out to be a big old pervo who was kidnapping kids off the

241
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,960
 street and making them be Nickelodeon shows.

242
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
 That would be, you know what I mean?

243
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
 It's a different level.

244
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
 It's a different level of things.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
 It's a different, so I really like that.

246
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,160
 You have the lost media thing and you have the real world impact.

247
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,960
 And we know if we ever have to go undercover as spies in North Korea, you know what our

248
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,520
 codename is going to be?

249
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 Cock stud.

250
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,840
 And that is enough to get the episode with an explicit tag.

251
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,360
 And it's also the end of that segment.

252
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,880
 Nathan, I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

253
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
 We're leaving behind a 30H parallel.

254
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
 We're driving all the way out to an internet cafe.

255
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
 Oh, it's South Korea.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
 We'll just go down South Korea.

257
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,280
 The place is wired for all internet.

258
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,680
 This second one's really short.

259
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,280
 It's one of those mysteries I don't even really know what is going on.

260
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
 Is it a mystery?

261
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
 I don't know.

262
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,640
 But it was brought to my attention again recently and I was like, I got to cover this

263
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
 because it is really weird.

264
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,720
 First off, I did a segment a long time ago.

265
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
 It was episode 594.

266
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,320
 Is IMDb a gateway to a parallel universe?

267
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,920
 And we talked about stuff being found on IMDb.

268
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
 That just doesn't make sense.

269
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,360
 Now, I know that it's user driven and a lot of you guys emailed me.

270
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,480
 I was like, oh, you know, people can put in whatever they want.

271
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,400
 And apparently there's a joke where you put in the angry video game nerd as mass murderers

272
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,880
 and psychopaths into movies.

273
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,840
 So it'll be like a movie.

274
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,440
 It'll be the peanut butter solution about the guy who eats too much peanut butter and

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
 he can grow hair forever.

276
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
 It's a real movie.

277
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 I saw as a kid.

278
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,920
 You'll be looking at the cast list and it'll say angry video game nerd, whatever the guy's

279
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,840
 name is, as Benito Mussolini.

280
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,800
 And you're like, well, he wasn't in that movie.

281
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,240
 So that's like a running joke.

282
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,720
 And that was explained to me after the fact.

283
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,160
 And I know what's user generated, but sometimes there's just these weird tidbits that you...

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,480
 Who does this?

285
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,160
 So there was a Reddit post from a deleted name.

286
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
 I hate it.

287
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,600
 Reddit is constantly just deleting stuff.

288
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,160
 I have to archive all this stuff.

289
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,080
 Basically they were saying there's this mysterious show in Mexico and I don't know what it could

290
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 be.

291
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,240
 And they said I was watching this movie called The Frame.

292
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,400
 I wanted to know more about it.

293
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,920
 So went time to be and this popped up.

294
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,640
 This television show called The Frame.

295
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,520
 And the description of it is, quote, a haunted picture frame that show this stuff.

296
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 Okay.

297
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,240
 This is where grammar is super important.

298
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,120
 Quote, a haunted picture frame that shows all your inner sexual fantasies in 1876.

299
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
 Unquote.

300
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,720
 That's the synopsis for the show.

301
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,760
 And you go, so does it show your fantasies?

302
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,840
 If they were in 1876?

303
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,200
 Like, is it your creepy sexual fantasies but everyone's wearing like old timey clothes?

304
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 Does it project whatever your sexual fantasies are back in time?

305
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,880
 So someone in 1876 is walking by a picture frame and they're like, oh, not this again.

306
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,000
 Ah, they're looking at some horribly disgusting thing.

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,840
 I'm not accusing you of having disgusting fetishes.

308
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
 Let me be clear.

309
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
 But this other person, the other listener, not you, the person sitting next to you, they

310
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
 have disgusting fetishes.

311
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,320
 Like, is it your fantasies being projected into 1876?

312
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,720
 Is it your fantasies turning into 1876 fantasies?

313
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:52,200
 So if I had a fantasy for blondes, right, would it be a blonde in like 1876 dress?

314
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
 I don't know.

315
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
 I don't know.

316
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,320
 So anyways, and also my sexual fantasies are pretty bland, surprisingly.

317
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,280
 So when you look into it a little bit more, it appears to be, there appears to be a Mexican

318
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:12,040
 television show called The Frame and it's hosted by Sofia Alvarado and it's a, like,

319
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,160
 entertainment program.

320
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,960
 Like if you look at it, they like did an episode on The Matrix and they did an episode on like

321
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,960
 horror movies and one on superheroes and one about Lost and so on and so forth.

322
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,680
 So who, what is that?

323
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
 Like, I get it.

324
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,640
 It's user generated and someone probably, but even like putting that together as a joke,

325
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,560
 what's the joke?

326
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
 I don't get it.

327
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,760
 So I think just because I don't get the joke doesn't mean it's a mystery, but it is quite

328
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,960
 bizarre.

329
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,520
 But I had that locked and loaded ready to go and I never covered it because I just thought,

330
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,840
 it's just kind of a weird thing, whatever.

331
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,160
 But I wanted to package it with this one because this is another one I had ready to go months

332
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,480
 ago and I thought, well, it's just kind of a weird quirky thing.

333
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,640
 I don't know where to go with it, but it's popped back into my field of view.

334
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,680
 There is a YouTube channel called New Trailers and a long time ago I watched this movie called

335
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,000
 A Christmas Cancellation and I almost did a Dead Rabbit Recommends on it with a hard

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,760
 asterisk because A Christmas Cancellation is an almost good movie.

337
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,360
 It's not a bad movie, but you watch the movie and you're like, oh, it's such a good idea.

338
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,760
 If they had a bigger budget, if the actors had more rehearsal time, if they had a better

339
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,120
 set, they had all this other stuff would have been really good.

340
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,920
 Really been super interesting movie.

341
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,600
 I've seen a lot of movies like that.

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
 Miranda Vale is the same way.

343
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,000
 Miranda Vale, amazing concept and if they had just had some more time to work on it,

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
 they could have got it.

345
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,520
 Miranda Vale is about a woman who finds out she's immortal after a serial killer puts a

346
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,200
 knife in her heart.

347
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 It's really, Miranda Vale is a really, really good movie, but it's raw.

348
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,280
 Like you're just like, if you only had an extra $50,000, you could only afford a little

349
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 more rehearsal.

350
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,160
 The actors work, but Miranda Vale, it was a super interesting movie.

351
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,800
 She can't die and it's about the serial killer and this victim trying to figure out why.

352
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,520
 I love stuff like that.

353
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 Very, very small sets.

354
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 I love that.

355
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,560
 Christmas cancellations about a group of characters, one by one television characters

356
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,680
 who find out their show's about to be canceled and when it's canceled, they'll cease to exist.

357
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,080
 Very, very interesting premise and no one believes the other person until they bring

358
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,800
 them into the bathroom because they go, you've never seen the bathroom, right?

359
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,280
 And they're like, no, because bathrooms don't appear on sitcoms.

360
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,680
 They go in the bathroom and the lighting changes and they're like, oh my God, you're right.

361
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,360
 What is reality?

362
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,000
 Really, really interesting movie, but it just wasn't there yet.

363
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,720
 But anyways, I was prepping it for a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

364
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 I was really debating on whether or not to cover it.

365
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,400
 So I went to go get the trailer like I normally do.

366
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,680
 When I looked through the Christmas cancellation trailer, it starts off with a news report

367
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,960
 about a guilty plea in a Westfield double murder.

368
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,560
 And it talks about a mother and a daughter being murdered during home robbery and you're

369
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,920
 like, what?

370
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,520
 And then it shows the trailer completely uninterrupted.

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:15,120
 And then at the very ending, it cuts to a segment from True Crime Daily, which talks

372
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
 about an eight month old pregnant woman who's murdered, shot or something like that.

373
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,480
 And then the emergency C-section, the baby dies and they cut to a shot of a baby in a

374
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,400
 coffin.

375
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,880
 And then that's the end of the YouTube video.

376
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
 And I was like, what?

377
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,440
 Now those incidents really did happen.

378
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
 Like I looked them up, those incidents are real and I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

379
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
 that's weird.

380
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
 That in and of itself is weird.

381
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,840
 And I thought, the movie is not, I don't think there's even any cussing in the movie, if

382
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,480
 I remember correctly, because it's supposed to be a sitcom.

383
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 But I had a hunch.

384
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,840
 I went to another video on that same channel, a baby reindeer's first Christmas.

385
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,520
 It came out the same year, 2020 as Christmas cancellation.

386
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,960
 And you go to start the video and the first thing you see is a man kicking a kitten, full,

387
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,240
 full, you know, full, the kitten's flying, animal abuse, punting it across the parking

388
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
 line.

389
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,000
 Then it shows the trailer and then ends with the report of a man shoplifting a bird.

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,040
 It's interesting because I saw that and it was shocking.

391
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,120
 Obviously, no one likes to see animals getting abused or really anyone getting abused.

392
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,720
 And I just go, that's weird.

393
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,160
 I thought it wasn't a bot.

394
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,200
 Like did something get messed up in the algorithm?

395
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,080
 Was someone, someone couldn't be doing this intentionally?

396
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,280
 What would be the purpose of that?

397
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,680
 I built my notes on it though and then just never covered it and went into my maybe folder.

398
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,800
 A couple of days ago, again on Reddit, a username Axelflunk popped up and they go, hey, I just

399
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,400
 found this super weird YouTube channel.

400
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,720
 This is deleted as well.

401
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 Stupid.

402
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 I hate Reddit.

403
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
 I hate Reddit.

404
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 They just delete stuff for no reason.

405
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,120
 But anyways, this guy posted and he goes, I found this really weird YouTube channel

406
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,760
 and his idea, and I didn't think about this, his idea was to be racist.

407
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,000
 You go to watch these trailers and you're hit with these images.

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,040
 He said that the images were black people committing crimes against white people.

409
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,320
 I don't remember who was, I don't remember those details.

410
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,200
 I do remember the guy who was kicking the kitten was black.

411
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
 I do remember that.

412
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,760
 I don't remember if the victims were white or black.

413
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,520
 I don't remember that.

414
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
 The kitten was just a cat.

415
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,200
 The kitten was neither.

416
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,520
 But the point is, I couldn't say who the perpetrators were, who the victims were, how racial it

417
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,320
 was, so I don't know about that.

418
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,640
 But, and I guess I could have went and double checked before I started doing the segment.

419
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
 I didn't think about that until just now.

420
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,160
 It's possible, right?

421
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
 It's possible.

422
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,920
 Maybe a racist influence behind this to show these crimes and then intersperse them with

423
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 children.

424
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,520
 But it seems like when he posted that, I thought, it reminded me of a Christmas cancellation,

425
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,720
 but I thought, what a small target, right?

426
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,880
 Like, how, what a small, I mean, hey honey, let's go watch a Christmas cancellation trailer.

427
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,120
 And I'm also, I'm also borderline racist.

428
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,040
 I haven't gone all the way yet, but maybe one or two more news segments will push me

429
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
 over the edge.

430
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,600
 Like, it's such a weird target.

431
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,800
 I think the video, the children's video and the dude kicking the cat, that's the most

432
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,320
 egregious that I saw.

433
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,200
 Like, because that's the most shocking.

434
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,520
 There's no context, there's no like news report context on that if I recall.

435
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,320
 It's just a guy kicking a cat.

436
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,720
 And paired up with a children's video, that's horrifying.

437
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,920
 So it's just so weird, I have no answer for it.

438
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,480
 Or is it bots?

439
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,200
 Is it someone picking these news stories to inflame racial tensions?

440
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 What?

441
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,240
 It's, again, they're not putting them on Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings trailers.

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,760
 They're not putting them on trailers that anyone actually wants to watch.

443
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,880
 They're putting them on, if I had never seen a Christmas cancellation and had wanted to

444
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,120
 recommend it, I would have never checked that trailer out.

445
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,880
 It's just to my new target audience, that if it's a troll, it's really bizarre.

446
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,120
 It could be the lead up to something.

447
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,400
 It could be building up to something bigger, but for right now, it's just a bizarre internet

448
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 mystery.

449
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,320
 Nathan, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbonercopter.

450
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
 We are leaving behind South Korea.

451
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,200
 We are headed all the way out to the Saga Prefecture in Japan.

452
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:36,240
 It's January 4th, 1992, and it's late at night.

453
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,640
 There's a farmer here, we don't have his name so we'll call him Toby.

454
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,280
 Toby has been having an issue with some cattle mutilations.

455
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,600
 Cattle mutilations are super interesting because it is the one paranormal phenomenon that everyone

456
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,880
 believes happens.

457
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,440
 The question is what causes it.

458
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,360
 I guess crop circles kind of falls into it, but cattle mutilations, there's not anyone

459
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,160
 going no, there's no such thing as cattle with their blood missing in their eye.

460
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,320
 Even people who don't believe in the aliens or the satanic cult or anything like that,

461
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,440
 they just think it's natural predation.

462
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,560
 But with ghosts people go "no that's just people being crazy, there are no ghosts."

463
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,760
 Or UFOs "oh no it's just swampcasts."

464
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,080
 Cattle mutilations is one of those things that you agree that it's happening.

465
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,120
 The question is what is going on.

466
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,200
 What is something that physically is happening, but what is causing it.

467
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,640
 But to Toby, he doesn't really care about the big picture right?

468
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,760
 Cows are his livelihood.

469
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,440
 A cattle mutilation would be the equivalent of someone wasting thousands of dollars of

470
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
 food at your local restaurant.

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,420
 Like it's very very impactful.

472
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:49,680
 So he is looking for the perpetrator and he's going to take care of it.

473
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,460
 So one night he hears his dog barking.

474
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:05,360
 So he heads out into the darkness to investigate and he enters his cow shed and he sees inside

475
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,000
 the cow shed.

476
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 A jellyfish.

477
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,280
 Long tentacles coming out of its jellyfish body.

478
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,480
 Now if you walked into your cow shed and there was just a jellyfish laying on the ground,

479
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
 that would be a mystery.

480
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,640
 You'd wonder how did that jellyfish get here.

481
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,280
 But this jellyfish, I should have said this earlier, this jellyfish is floating.

482
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,400
 You're like "why is he making the sound effects?"

483
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
 There's just a dead jellyfish on some hay.

484
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 This jellyfish is floating.

485
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,160
 So the tentacles are like hanging down and it's this jellyfish thing just kind of floating

486
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,960
 through the shed.

487
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,560
 And he's freaking out as you would.

488
00:25:53,560 --> 00:26:04,360
 This jellyfish is floating around your shed and he looks and his cow.

489
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,560
 His leg is broken.

490
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,600
 That poor little cow is a broken leg and the jellyfish is just kind of floating there.

491
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,280
 And Toby is watching this bizarre scene.

492
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:21,240
 And all of a sudden the jellyfish continues to float and just floats outside the shed

493
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,080
 window and then vanishes.

494
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
 That's the end of the story, right?

495
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,000
 That's the end of the story.

496
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,680
 And it's interesting because obviously, we don't know for sure, but obviously the idea

497
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,600
 is that the jellyfish was killing the cows, was causing the catamethylation.

498
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,960
 Now this story, I got it from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

499
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,800
 They got it from Jenny Randalls and Peter Ho in the book "World's Best True UFO Stories."

500
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,600
 And Jenny Randalls, we've covered her a lot.

501
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,920
 I have a lot of respect for her.

502
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,360
 I haven't come across anything that's been out and out, fraudful.

503
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,800
 And ThinkAbout@Docs.com has treated us very well.

504
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,000
 As absurd as this story is, you kind of have to look at the pedigree of it.

505
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,560
 Because catamethylation is something that happens wherever there's cattle.

506
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,600
 And that's the big question, what is doing it?

507
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,800
 I've always leaned towards the idea that it's humans doing it.

508
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,280
 If it's not natural, because we've talked about that before, predation will attack the

509
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,240
 soft parts of the body.

510
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,800
 And I'll tell you right now, there is a big difference between completely devoid of blood,

511
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,400
 completely suck drain of blood, or having nearly all its blood sucked out.

512
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,200
 There's a huge difference between that, and really there's no scientific difference between

513
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 that.

514
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 What's nearly all their blood?

515
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 More than half?

516
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,560
 Yeah, technically.

517
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,120
 Whenever you look at these stories, a lot of times they'll say nearly all the blood is

518
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,400
 removed.

519
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,560
 And then when the story is repeated, it will be said "devoid of all blood."

520
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,520
 There's a huge difference between the two.

521
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,240
 There's a huge difference between the two.

522
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,280
 But predation makes sense.

523
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,320
 But outside of that, I don't see a reason why aliens would be doing it.

524
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,560
 I think it's human action.

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,840
 I think it's cultists.

526
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
 I think it's cultists.

527
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,000
 Now, it could be all three, or really all four.

528
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,280
 Could be the jellyfish scenario as well.

529
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,200
 I don't think you can ever really say all of it is one thing when you're looking at the

530
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,240
 paranormal, but the thing I love about the jellyfish is it adds such an interesting wrinkle.

531
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,920
 And it would be something you're not looking for.

532
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,040
 We're looking up in the sky for spaceships, or we're looking up in the sky for black helicopters,

533
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,000
 or we're looking for the candles, the monks, and the robes walking around with their sacrificial

534
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,920
 daggers and things like that.

535
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,240
 But a jellyfish floating through a farm?

536
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,680
 I mean, unless it was a super well-lit area, would you be able to see a translucent jellyfish?

537
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,920
 This guy was kind of a white, a whitish color.

538
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,360
 We've talked about creatures in the sky as well, sky beans, giant jellyfishes in the

539
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,160
 sky.

540
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,440
 So would it make sense that some of them are smaller and feed on cows, or are just animals

541
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,720
 in general?

542
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,320
 It just, again, adds another level to the mystery.

543
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,680
 There's nothing we can definitively say that this story is true, or that this is the cause

544
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,960
 of more than just this guy's catamethylations.

545
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,040
 But why not?

546
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,680
 And that's one thing that I love about the paranormal community, but also kind of bugs

547
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,720
 me and we'll finish it up like this.

548
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,920
 Some people always want to say, like, let's take Missing 411, for example, the idea that

549
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,360
 people go missing in the national parks.

550
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,200
 People will try to give one paranormal answer to all of it, being like, oh, it's secret

551
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,800
 agents, super soldiers in the woods who can cloak themselves that accounts for all of

552
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 it.

553
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,960
 But maybe not all of them.

554
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,160
 Maybe some of them are natural, maybe some of them are super soldiers, maybe some of

555
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,360
 them are bigfoot.

556
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,640
 We seem to get locked into these categories.

557
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,760
 And it's no fun.

558
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,680
 Couldn't some crop circles be made by UFOs, some crop circles made by pranksters, but

559
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,920
 some crop circles made by ghosts?

560
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,320
 Why not?

561
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,000
 Couldn't some catamethylations be done by these?

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,640
 See these creatures, like honestly, if you went to a skeptic, they would think this was

563
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,120
 the most unbelievable out of all of them, because you're introducing this new creature

564
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
 into the food chain.

565
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,280
 They'd go, yeah, maybe UFOs, probably not, maybe cultists, that's a little more likely,

566
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
 but what?

567
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,440
 They've got floating jellyfish that's even dumber than aliens.

568
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,920
 But why not?

569
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,840
 And this to me is scarier.

570
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,440
 This to me honestly can be a little bit scarier than the cultists going after the cows or

571
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,240
 the UFOs abducting the cows and skinning them and then dropping them back off.

572
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,920
 That just doesn't make any sense to me.

573
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
 Why would they, they just dropped them in the middle of the ocean.

574
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,360
 Why would they drop them back off?

575
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
 Why would they want?

576
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,160
 Something that kind of makes, the cultists want to breed fear, right?

577
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,320
 They worship the dark ones, they love fear, but aliens, you know, whatever, they may not

578
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
 even believe in God.

579
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,520
 We've had a lot of different discussions about aliens on the issue, but they just get rid

580
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,840
 of it or vaporize it or dump it in the ocean or whatever, you would never find it, you

581
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,160
 would just find cattle missing.

582
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,120
 The jellyfish wouldn't have any motive, it would just kill it there, drink its blood

583
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,560
 and eat its eyeballs there.

584
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,920
 It's just like most animals don't try to hide their prey, they just kill it and eat

585
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,760
 it and then leave.

586
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,360
 And if this thing exists, would it ever stop at cows?

587
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,280
 Like when I read this story, I thought, dude, could you imagine being attacked by something

588
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,840
 like this?

589
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,440
 Being attacked by something that you didn't even know existed before its tendrils wrapped

590
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,280
 around your neck.

591
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:43,240
 You had no idea that this was part of the ecosystem until you felt acid against your

592
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,720
 skin and you're trying to struggle, you're trying to grab at tendrils that just seem

593
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
 supernaturally strong.

594
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:00,280
 It was designed to hunt and kill large mammals and it's sucking out your blood.

595
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:07,600
 It attaches a suction cup to your left eye socket and before the same thing happens to

596
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,920
 your right eye, you see your left eye get sucked up into the tendril, slowly being dissolved.

597
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:25,640
 Soon, both eyeballs are gone, the acid pours through your system as you try to struggle,

598
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,440
 as you try to get away and you fail.

599
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:41,200
 You are now a lifeless husk, nearly drained of all your blood, all the soft organs dissolved

600
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,520
 away.

601
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,360
 If it happened to your house, it would be a huge mystery, but if you were out camping,

602
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,600
 out farming, in the middle of nowhere enjoying nature.

603
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,880
 And this happened to you and your body wasn't found, maybe they'd think it was natural causes,

604
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,560
 because it does appear that you suffered a heart attack and the predators just came

605
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,480
 and ate away the softest parts of you until your body was found.

606
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,720
 But what the autopsy can't show is that your heart attack was brought on by pure fear.

607
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,800
 You always wanted to know the truth, is the world of the paranormal real, do cryptids

608
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,680
 exist, is there something more than what the skeptics say, but you always figured you'd

609
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,000
 live to tell the tale.

610
00:33:38,000 --> 00:34:03,960
 Instead you just became another piece of evidence, in an ever growing mystery.

611
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:32,360
 And that's what you're going to find out.
