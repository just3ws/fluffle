1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Is a killer planet headed towards Earth?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 And is it possible, even in the slightest,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 that using methamphetamines can make you immortal?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. We got a great episode today.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We got two great stories. We're going to do a Dead Rabbit Recommends in the middle of them.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I just saw a great movie. I wanted to let all of you guys know about it.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And our start off here is going to kind of relate to the movie we're going to be talking about.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 As I was watching it, so when I was a kid, there was an episode of the new Twilight Zone.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 So they had the old Twilight Zone and then they brought it back in the 80s.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 There was an episode where a man, a scientist was trying to figure out this equation

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 and he's just looking at the board and he goes, "Man, I would sell my soul to have the answer to this equation."

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And a demon appears and says, "Okay, here's the answer."

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And now your soul's mine unless you can give me a task I can't complete.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And the whole episode was kind of just like this debate between the two characters.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It was really interesting and they're constantly having this debate.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And the scientist is trying to come up with something that a task the demon cannot fulfill.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 If he can't come up with one, then the demon takes his soul.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And the whole episode, the guy's just thinking about, you know, like, could I send him back in time?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Could I send him to the edge of the universe?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Could I send him inside of a black hole?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And the demon's like, "I can do all of that stuff."

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Like, no matter what you say, I can do.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 There's nothing I can't do.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I've been in the future. I've been to the end of time.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I've been to the beginning of time. I've been to every corner of the universe.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I've been at the microscopic level.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The macroscopic level. Well, we're at the macroscopic level.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 But you know what I mean? He's inhabited every single thing.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 He knows every single thing about the universe.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 There's not a question he can't answer.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And at the end of the episode, the scientist goes, "Okay, I want you to get lost."

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And the demon's like, "No, no, no."

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Because somebody who knows everything can't, can never be lost.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And then the scientist goes about his business.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm assuming that he goes, takes a smoke break.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So the question of whether or not you can outwit a demon is most likely no,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 because they are like this infinitely existing being.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 But here's my question. Can you outsmart a ghost?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Like, technically, a ghost is just the spirit of a human.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So you think it would have the natural learning capabilities of a human.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It would be able to maybe understand.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Let's say that if you were a game show host in life, and then you died and became a ghost,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 you're not going to automatically know about astrophysics or know about, you know,

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 how a car engine works or the best play during baseball.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You're going to, I think, be limited to what your earthly knowledge was,

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 and stuff like, you obviously know what it's like to be dead.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And you know about, you know, astral realms, maybe.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Can you outwit a ghost? Can you outthink a ghost?

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Would it be that simple if my house was being haunted?

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Could I build some sort of home alone style trap, and the ghost wouldn't see it coming?

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Or are ghosts also just like demons where they're like ultimately perceptible?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I don't know. And you know, it's funny because when you watch,

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 generally in movies that involve ghosts, they are, do have kind of a limited human intelligence.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 They're not hyper intelligent. They can't really read minds and kind of give you like spooky dreams and stuff like that.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But yeah, I think it would be interesting.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 If I was a ghost, would you simply be trying to outwit my intelligence now,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 or would I be some sort of hyper intelligent malevolent creature watching you while you sleep?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I don't know.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Actually, I think that just answered the question honestly,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 because ghosts can do stuff like turn your electrical, you know, turn lights on,

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 or make it in cold room, or like open a cabinet, and spoiler alert,

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 that's all stuff that also happens accidentally.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Like if you come home and your cabinets open, doesn't mean you have a ghost.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It could be a whole host of other things.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 If you walk in and all your plates are piled up and it says help me on the mirror,

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 you probably have a ghost.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 If you walk in your house and there's like a portal and there's tendrils coming out of it,

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 you might have a demon.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So I think that's kind of the difference.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Ghosts tend to do stuff, manipulate stuff in houses that are things that a human would do.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 They're not going to, you know, like rearrange the physics.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So you fall through a portal each time you walk into your shower.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 That's more of a demonic thing.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Assuming any of that stuff actually exists, which I believe it does, but there's a lot of people who don't.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I've never walked into a portal.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I've talked about that. That's one of my fears.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I would never take a shower again.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And I barely take showers now.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So, so this first story actually comes from a listener.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 They emailed me.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 This goes out to, I'm assuming this is a fake name, Shakira Shakira.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I don't think that's your real name.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 This is the story of a killer planet, one of many.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And a lot of times people go, well, it's the same planet as this.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So this is Shakira Shakira was walking around downtown and saw this sticker.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I don't know where they're at, but they saw this sticker on a light pole that said, so this planet is called her colubus, her colubus.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I'm assuming that's how it's pronounced.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And it's also gone by other names like planet X or Nibiru, but her colubus is the name given to this killer planet by the author slash esoteric genius in their own words.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 VM Rabulu.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 VM Rabulu.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Now this is a Colombian channeler, a Colombian mystic who had the visions of this coming planet.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And they believe that her colubus is, comes around every so often, every 100,000 years or 15,000 years or whatever really suits the fancy of the writer.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And as it comes within Earth's orbit, it begins to upset the planet, which is obvious.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's what would happen.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Huge tattle waves, earthquakes, volcanoes, things like that.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And they point to things that this has been going on for basically since the beginning of time.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And that's why we have stories like Atlantis and all these civilizations being destroyed.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And I'm like, okay, that's possible.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Like obviously planetary bodies, we're just kind of all floating around in the universe.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There's comets of crash in OS, meteorites of crash in OS, things have come close.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 There is a possibility that a giant planet is on a 100,000 year rotation and it comes by every 100,000 years and messes stuff up.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The thing is, is that we don't really see any evidence of that.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 We're not seeing any sort of like, whoa, whoa, whoa, gravity effects.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 We're not entirely sure on it, but something that's supposed to be five or six times the mass of Jupiter, even if it was cycling around.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And to see it was supposed to come back around 2012, 2013.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 If it was that close, if it's supposed to come in within the next 10, 20 years, we would start to detect gravity wobbles.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But I'm on board with that. That's definitely possible.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That this planet is floating around and it causes these disasters because we can look back in Legends and see these disasters.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 What I am not on board with is his solution.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So what it is is that as the planet gets closer, it's going to cause all these disasters.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So we're doomed, right? There's nothing we can do to stop it.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But the way to avoid it, so you can't avoid it, like not like Earth goes, puts on the brakes and like skits past us.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 You meditate and your spirit goes into the astral.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You know what I mean? Like that's where a lot of these stories lose me.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Like I'm like, okay, I'm on board. There could be a planet coming along and then they're like, find your fifth chakra and move to the light.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And then you will go and you will find eight Huckleberries, but only eat the sixth one.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 No, come on, man. Like you lose me.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 A lot of people do this. A lot of these conspiracy theories do that.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 They just get a little too esoteric for me.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Funny point, this guy doesn't like white people either.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 He says, and this is from one of the websites here,

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 "The encounter of the Earth with Hercalubus takes place every side real year," whatever that means,

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 "and is thus a natural cosmic event. The first few races were not afraid of the disasters since they had not degenerated.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 They still had extraordinary powers and used them to escape the catastrophes.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 The protoplasmic and Hyborian races, for example, simply submerged themselves into the fourth dimension when the catastrophes began multiplying.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The portion of the Lemurian civilization that had not degenerated did the same while the rest perished.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 The vast majority of the Atlanteans died during the submersion of Atlantis, but a small minority was able to escape.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Unfortunately, due to the extreme degeneration of the Arian race, there will be few who will survive the upcoming claticisms."

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Thanks, man.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And everyone else can do this meditation and eat the Sixth Huckleberry and so on and go forth to this planet.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 You lose me. Not the racism thing, whatever. That's whatever floats your boat. I don't care about that.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Other than I'm gonna die in this cataclysm.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 What loses me is the spiritual side of it.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 If a giant planet's coming, there's really no dimension I can sneak in or out of to avoid getting just melted by this volcano.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 What's interesting about this story?

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Because that's pretty much it. I did a bunch of research on it and everything just kind of says the same thing.

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Killer planet, killer planet, killer planet.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 What's interesting about this story is there are parallels to it that are real.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 The idea that we have these ancient stories and legends and it being linked to something that's coming up.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So, I live in the Pacific Northwest. I'm out in Hood River in Oregon.

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And they found out fairly recently that there's a massive fault line up here.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And they're talking about if it ever goes off, it will be one of the biggest earthquakes ever.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It will just--everything west of the I-5 will be covered in a tsunami.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We're not prepared for it in any sort of way.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 What isn't killed in the earthquake is just going to get flattened out there.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 The New Yorker did an amazing article on it a while back.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And I'm going to link it to you. I really recommend reading it.

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It's a great article about the Pacific Northwest fault line.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I think it's called the Cascadia fault line.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And just earthquakes in general.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 They're talking numbers in the tens of thousands.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Massive earthquake.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And I've come from California where everything was earthquake-proof.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And up here, it's not really.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Hood River is probably going to be affected by it.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We'd obviously be affected by the refugees coming in from it.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And our freeways are going to be down, food supplies, things like that.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 What's interesting--so they discovered this fault line.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 But there was this old Native American legend about a guide.

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Some hunters went out from their tribe and there was a great shaking.

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And when they went back, the entire tribe was under water.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And explorers had heard that story and they're like,

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "Oh, you know, Native Americans are just telling this story."

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 It was an old story.

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So they were saying, you know, like, my grandparent went through this.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Like, you know, there are these stories.

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They also found in the area, they found a forest of dead trees.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And they look at them and they go,

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 "Well, those trees were killed by saltwater.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 We know those trees were killed by saltwater just from testing them and things like that."

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And they figured that the water table was just a little bit different and they got flooded.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And then over time, the water receded and the trees just died from saltwater.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 There was no written history of the area back, say, in the 1700s.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 The Native Americans had no written history, so we didn't have anything to compare it against.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But in Japan at the time, their written history is impeccable.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Their civilization was full bore back in the 1700s.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They'd been around for thousands of thousands of years, had written languages and paper, documentation, all that stuff.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So in their history, they talk about a 600-mile-long wave hit Japan.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And they didn't know where it came from.

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 They just...

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Just hit some, smashes them.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And so the people who survived wrote it down in their legends and wrote it down in their history books

187
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and said, "This happened and all these people died and so on and so forth."

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 What happened was American scientists and Japanese scientists got together and they started comparing notes.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And they realized that that tsunami, that 600-mile-long tsunami that hit Japan,

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 matched up with the timeline for those trees in that area to be dead by saltwater.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And so that's when they started thinking, because this research was back in the 80s,

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 that's when they started thinking what probably happened, because they had suffered no earthquake in Japan,

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 this tsunami came out of nowhere, and the cascades are part of the Ring of Fire.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 The scientists go, "Maybe we should start looking for a fault line here,

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because maybe an earthquake happened here and sent that tidal wave."

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And sure enough, that's what they found.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So using these old Native American legends, these Japanese records,

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 they can actually find the causes of these disasters.

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I think that is far more fascinating than the planet flying by, blowing stuff up.

200
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But that's just the way it is, that's the way history is.

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Oh, let me just say, so no.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Again, there's a chance that a planet's going to come by and swing by,

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 or it can smash and stuff like that.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 It's astronomically small, but it's possible.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I think that if it does come by, whether or not you meditate or float around or stop being an Aryan,

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 you're doomed anyways, it's a giant planet and it's interfering with their gravity,

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 that's just living in the cosmos as scary as that is, as dark and as scary and as infinite as that is.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 We're going to do a quick Dead Rabbit Recommend here.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I just watched a movie.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 It just came out, it's on DVD, video on demand, I think it's in some theaters.

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It's awesome.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It's called The Toy Box.

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I'm going to tell you the premise and you're going to laugh, and like I did,

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 and then you're going to be intrigued, hopefully.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The movie is about a haunted RV.

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And I was like, "What? Okay, I got to watch that."

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 What it is, is there is an RV that was used by a serial killer to kill his victims.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It kind of just drove around America.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And a family gets ownership of it.

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And that's pretty much all I'm going to tell you about the plot.

221
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It's kind of an ensemble cast.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Misha Barton's in it, who I just absolutely love.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I think she's super hot.

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 I never watched her on the OC because I don't watch shows like that.

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 She's been doing a lot of horror the past couple of years, so that's really cool.

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 There was a really hot actress in it, and I was like, "She kind of looks like Denise Richards,

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 like a younger Denise Richards."

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 "It's Denise Richards. How is she not aging? She looks like she's 25."

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I don't know who the guys were.

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But anyways, the director of the movie is this director named Tom Nagel.

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 He did a movie I previously watched called Clown Town.

232
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I wasn't a fan of that.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I watched maybe half of it.

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It's cut to the ending.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I wasn't a fan of that.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 However, if he needs to make Clown Town to make this movie, it's totally worth it.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 This movie is gross.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 They do have some gross depths, but it feels dirty, and it feels sweaty.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Very, very well done movie.

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 The whole movie takes place in the RV or around the RV.

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's trapped in the middle of the wilderness.

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The kills come out of nowhere.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I'll say this, too.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 The reason why I'm recommending this is that it's other than just being a well-made movie,

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 it has one of the most powerful ghosts I've seen in a movie.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It can do pretty much what it wants.

247
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It can possess the RV.

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It can possess people.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 It's victims will show up to haunt people.

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 It can communicate in a way, but it doesn't.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 It's just primal.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It's this very primal ghost/demon character.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 That's why I was saying, when you talk about outwitting demons,

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 you wouldn't be able to outwit this one.

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Because he already spent his life hunting humans.

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 He knows how to make people suffer and make people his prey.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And now he's just a force of nature, or a force of super nature.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Is that a word? Super nature? Like supernatural?

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It's a very primal enemy, which definitely raises the stakes over something.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 That's just like, "La la la la la la."

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And you're like, "What was over there?"

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 The movie is not what I expected.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 The RV to be haunted and the family was going to have to band together to figure out it.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 No.

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 No.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 The movie starts throwing the curveballs right away.

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It's very, very well done.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The toy box starring Misha Barton, who's super hot,

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and Denise Richards, who is amazingly attractive.

270
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I don't know.

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And yeah, toy box. Check it out.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Highly recommend it.

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Dead Rabbit recommends the toy box.

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 We're going to go ahead and move on to our next story.

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 A story I was like, "Oh man, it's on the conspiracy."

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You know, it's on the iceberg conspiracy list.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 So anyways, meth immortality was on the iceberg list.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And I went and I did some research assuming it was true.

279
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Like I always do.

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I'm not going to let my personal biases towards meth, you know, stop me from doing that.

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I found some interesting things.

282
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Most of it's nonsense, but I did find an interesting key to the component.

283
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So the first thing is, are there health benefits to meth and phenomine use?

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 There are people who claim there are health benefits.

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Sometimes they're meth users, so that shouldn't shock you too much.

286
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Here is a quote.

287
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 I'm going to try to read this as a meth addict would.

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 We'll see if this works.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "We have weight loss here. Good for obese people. It can treat ADHD.

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It has high motivation to achieve skills.

291
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 That is good for students who are like four grades ahead of their grade.

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 You can even go without sleeping for days or even a few weeks.

293
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 The record holder was a 17-year-old high school guy

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 who went for 11 days without sleeping to complete a science project.

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 With ICE, those records can be easily broken.

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You might even be called a real-life superhuman,

297
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 but even a superhuman needs to recharge.

298
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 So to recharge, after a superhuman show of no sleep and no effects,

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 he would oversleep for a day.

300
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The average person would sleep for eight hours and can go for at least 24-48 hours

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 without sleeping until he/she needed to sleep.

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But this superhuman just needs to oversleep for just four hours,

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 for weeks of no sleep. Wow."

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You will regenerate even after being -30 degrees Celsius temperature,

305
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 with shirt and pants or even nude, like in January 1942 for 500 Nazi German soldiers.

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Users will become more self-confident and with impressive productivity,

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 let's just say, if you have 15 criminals with steel rods attacking you alone,

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 even an all-around boss like me would eventually lose to the gang.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So ICE is just what you need, unless you are stronger than Big Z.

310
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 One time in my elementary school, two of my heaviest friends went crazy

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 and just kept attacking me. They were 90 kilograms in total.

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 One of them tried to push me out of the school building,

313
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 but got back a very hard kick to the stomach.

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 One of my friends got crazy two weeks later,

315
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 knocking out four adult men in the process.

316
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 So it's basically grade 5 me fighting against nine normal men.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Surprisingly, my crazy friend didn't give up after a hard pinch to the neck.

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 If I used crystal meth, I would beat them very easily.

319
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 There was no winner because the teachers eventually saw it.

320
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 If it were to continue on, I might win with huge losses,

321
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 but for arm wrestling, they're very strong.

322
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Just seeing Nazi German soldiers how they benefited.

323
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I think meth should have a new name of Superman pill,

324
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 even though there are some side effects like excessive aging and stuff like that.

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 We can also name it "merical pills."

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Just, you... drugs aren't so bad at all.

327
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 The benefits are the same as consequences, at least, or somewhat more.

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I think you should take it if you want to beat records.

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Otherwise, no. No.

330
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 My hands cramped halfway through doing that.

331
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I wish you could see it. I was clutching my fingers and occasionally picking at my face.

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I hate meth. I've never used it.

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I've seen people use it.

334
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I've never had a friend die from it, but I've had friends throw their lives away for it.

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It should not be called Superman pills.

336
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 It doesn't turn into Superman. You'll think you're Superman.

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I couldn't find any confirmation of the...

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 This is my job now. I hope you guys realize.

339
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 When a guy makes a claim that in January 1942,

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 500 Nazi German soldiers were able to be nude in -30 degrees Celsius,

341
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I had to research that, because that's my job.

342
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 The ravines of a meth addict now become something I have to look into.

343
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I couldn't find anything of it.

344
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No. It should not be called Superman pills or the "merical pills."

345
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 It does. It will help you lose weight because you stop eating and it boosts your metabolism,

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 and it can keep you up.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That young kid who did the high school, the 17-year-old high school kid who went 11 days without sleep,

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 did it without meth. I think I mentioned him on another story.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I may have cut it out on our story about "Can't Sleep Kill You."

350
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I did mention it. It was for a science project.

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 This guy's saying, "Just do meth. Just do meth. Kid, you could have done way better.

352
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 You would have gotten like 10 As on your test. 10 As. 10 As."

353
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 There was quite a few comments like this where people are like,

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 "Oh, no. It's really beneficial if you just do it on the weekends,

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 or if you just do it in your morning."

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Or nurses put it in their coffee and truck drivers use it and stuff like that.

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And yes, people do use meth less occasionally than the meth user.

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Meth causes things like meth mouth.

359
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 It causes you to age prematurely. It can cause brain damage over time.

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 It makes you depressed once you stop taking it because your dopamine levels are all messed up.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You don't eat. You don't sleep.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 You'll start to get psychosis from not sleeping.

363
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It can cause you to be violent, not necessarily the meth of the psychosis.

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I will say the main problem with meth is that it makes you incredibly irritating to be around.

365
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The one thing I found that you could possibly say that meth can make you immortal

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 is when we look at crystal meth.

367
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's crystals.

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And there are a lot of people who believe that you can charge a crystal like quartz or things like that.

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You can charge these crystals with healing energy and then use them.

370
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And you can find countless resources where align your chakras with crystals, heal yourself with crystals,

371
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 and cleanse your house with crystals.

372
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Very, very common. It's all about charging the crystal with the positive energy, getting a crystal that can hold.

373
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 They're like batteries basically, crystals in the purest form when we're getting into the spiritual now.

374
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I don't necessarily believe all of this, but I'm going to present it to you as they would.

375
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 So the crystals you can charge with your own emotional energy, they're basically batteries, and then you can use that.

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And I have a few crystals around my house, but I'm not like, "Oh no, where's my crystal?"

377
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I think they're nice to look at.

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I found cool rocks on the ground and go, "This is my lucky rock, and I'll keep it in my pocket for a while."

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But people, this is the thing.

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So if you accept that's true, if you accept that a crystal, a crystalline form can be used to charge energy,

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 why can't you charge crystal meth?

382
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Why wouldn't you be able to take, I just heard a hundred listeners reaching for their meth bag to hold while they listen to the rest of this episode.

383
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 If I'm holding my meth and I'm charging it with positive healing energy, I'm making this meth,

384
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I'm putting all of my positive and joyful emotions into this meth, into these crystals,

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 and then I put them into my body, I'm breaking them down into the purest form of healing power.

386
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What is more personal? What is more intimate than breathing the crystals in,

387
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 versus if you have a quartz crystal and you set it on your chest and this is putting healing energy into your third chakra,

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 this is you actually taking the crystals into your bloodstream.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Have you ever smelt crystal meth? It's gross.

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I remember once I came into possession of a very large chunk of crystal meth. It's a long story.

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I'll tell you the story because otherwise you're going to think I'm using crystal meth.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 A cop's were looking for somebody, they asked me to do him a favor.

393
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Anyways, it smells like every household chemical poured into a ball. It was disgusting.

394
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 It was so gross. It smelled like a little bit of chlorine and a little bit of formaldehyde.

395
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 It just smelled toxic and I remember looking at this going, why would someone put this in their body?

396
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 At least marijuana smells natural.

397
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 You smell marijuana. You may not like the smell, but it smells like something you would smell in the forest.

398
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Anyways, you charge those crystals and you breathe them into your body or you inject them into your body.

399
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I got all these meth stories. I knew a guy who's all of his veins collapsed from doing meth

400
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 and he was trying to inject meth into his eyeball and his friends had to stop him.

401
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 See now you, I know these people. These aren't stories I read on the internet.

402
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 This is why I'm so hardcore on not doing meth because I've seen otherwise reasonable people try to do horrible stuff.

403
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I wasn't there when he tried to put the needle in his eyeball, but the guy told me the story and his friend was there

404
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 and she was like, yeah, we have to stop him because he was about to inject meth into his eye.

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He wanted it so bad. I don't know how long this episode is going to run, but the point is that,

406
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I know I keep telling these horror stories and I go back to the story because again, I'm absolutely against this,

407
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 but I got to report it. I don't have to report it, but you charge the meth crystals and you put them in your body.

408
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It was interesting because as I was researching this, I came across a little nugget.

409
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 You can even imbue the meth with positive emotions while they're forming while you're cooking it.

410
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I found this little thing here. I'm not going to read this as a crank addict because I really like that.

411
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It really took a lot out of my hands. The next variety we avoid is that which we term an anger batch.

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 This strange alchemical mixture, whether embedded into the final product by differing neurotoxins

413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 employed during the various refining processes or by vibe level,

414
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 impartation by the very cooks or subsequent handlers themselves for the blessed shards of the gods or themselves

415
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 quartz-like crystals, fully capable of retaining imparted energies we know not,

416
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 is responsible. This makes no sense because the guy who wrote this is a meth addict, by the way.

417
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I'm reading this word for word.

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Is responsible for the artificial and in our case utterly undesired evocation of unwarranted rage.

419
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Sadly, it is a trick of the substance itself to trap the unwary participant into remaining oblivious

420
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 as to the cause of the instantaneous substance-induced anger, a pitfall which has snared all too many

421
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 who employ the substance for merely profane reasons.

422
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Add to this the danger involved in stimulating the so-called reptilian subbrain of the human neurophysiology

423
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 without sufficient preliminary preparation, not unlike raising the cundalini without adequate preparation.

424
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And you can clearly see how this aspect as well can pernaciously exa-ab-erate the onslaught of inappropriate rage

425
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 brought on by a tainted anger batch."

426
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Again, hanging out with meth heads is irritating. Reading what they're writing is ten times worse.

427
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So, he's saying that if the cook's angry and they're going under a lot of stress, it can affect the crystals being constructed

428
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 and the people handling it if they're also putting all their rage and anger into the batch.

429
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 So, if you're just loaded full of those negative energies, but if everyone's positive in the meth supply line,

430
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 you will create good meth, not in the sense that it's like, "Oh man, this is the best meth I've ever had.

431
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Oh my god, I totally need to get some more."

432
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 That it actually instills you with good feelings rather than the negative and the paranoia and the angry and all that stuff.

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 If you accept the possibility that crystals can store energy and can store emotions and you can use them for healing,

434
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 you would, in a sense, have to accept that meth is a crystal, crystal meth, and it would have the same effect.

435
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 If a crystal is a crystal is a crystal, and one can store energy, the meth can store energy, and in a sense, this guy's correct.

436
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Ah, you...

437
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I think if you accepted the possibility of everything that I said that a crystal is a crystal is a crystal

438
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 and you can charge crystals with healing energy and then you can inject those crystals into you constantly

439
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and you are constantly charging your crystals and constantly injecting them into you in some sort of a weird way if you believed all of that.

440
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So, I do believe you can charge crystals and I do believe you can charge items.

441
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I think it's more of a mental thing though.

442
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I don't think they actually have any sort of power.

443
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 You can have your favorite teddy bear, but that teddy bear doesn't actually have any real power.

444
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 You just have a good emotional attachment to it.

445
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 However, there are people who do believe that you charge things with positive or negative energy and then it is spiritually charged or emotionally charged.

446
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 It's just not something mental, but it's something that you can then charge a crystal and give it to someone else and then they will feel that charge and that healing energy.

447
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 If you accept that, you accept that a crystal is a crystal is a crystal.

448
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 If you accept that crystals can be charged with positive or negative energy.

449
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 If you believe that that energy is not just a mental trick, but it is actually a metaphysical energy, you are charging with that.

450
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 If you injected that healing light metaphysical supernatural energy into your body or smoked it and did it over and over again and only did meth that was charged by positive people all the way down,

451
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 you could, if you believe that, in theory live forever because you're getting that healing energy into your body.

452
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Do I believe that? Absolutely not.

453
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 That's meth immortality for you.

454
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 You charge the crystals positively, but you have to do it the whole chain down.

455
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 No one can ever touch it who has any negative thoughts.

456
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 It has to be pure and holy and healing all the way down.

457
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And then instead of getting the healing power from putting the chakra under your pillow or in your pocket or on your chest or whatever you smoke it or injected in your bloodstream, you're getting 100% pure, uncut healing metaphysical energy.

458
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I don't believe it. I think meth is incredibly harmful and I would never do it and I hope no one ever does it again and if it disappeared from planet earth, I would be happy.

459
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So that's meth immortality for you.

460
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 It's on the iceberg list. I gotta cover it. It was interesting to look up.

461
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 I was just like, "Ah man, I hope no one listens to this who's in recovery."

462
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And they were like, "Ugh."

463
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 You know, so I apologize for that.

464
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 It's a struggle to get off of drugs, so that wasn't my intention and again, it's not real unless you believe it, unless you believe in all that healing crystal stuff and it has to be real, I guess.
