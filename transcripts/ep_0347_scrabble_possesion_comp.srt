1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Can a cold blooded killer also be a hero?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we take a look at a story about a man who was lonely.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Recently divorced, didn't know where his life was going.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 So he begins playing a game he played in college, a way to contact the spirits using a scrabble board.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 He wanted answers.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Instead he got possessed.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 The snow has fully moved into Hood River.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 It actually isn't snowing right now, but the streets still have my white enemy,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 my powdery nemesis, my flaky anti-friend.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's everywhere, but it'll be gone soon, hopefully.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Every so often you might hear the sound of a snow plow driving by, so we hear a "brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Every so often you might hear the sound of a snowplow driving by, so we hear a "brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 21 years old.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 A couple months later, I guess in Europe, Scotland, this area, they have a thing called the Samaritans.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I think it's mostly based in Scotland, but I don't think if you called from England, they're like,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 "No mate, just kill yourself!" Click, hang up.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Samaritans is like an anti-suicide hotline.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And they're also sworn to confidentiality.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 That way people can call up and say,

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 "I've done some horrible stuff and I'm thinking about killing myself and you'd feel comfortable talking to these people."

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So they're sworn to confidentiality.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 If the police want the information, they can subpoena the organization, but as a Samaritan yourself,

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 you promise to never reveal any information about the callers.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 There's a guy who's been calling in to the Samaritans,

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 and apparently he called multiple times, but on one of the phone calls,

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 click, "Hello, this is the Samaritans. What's going on?" And this guy goes, "I've killed a girl."

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 "I killed a girl. Left her body in the woods."

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Kind of tells this story.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So this Samaritan working that night, or day, I don't know,

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 it's not stated in the article, could have been in the middle of the afternoon.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 The Samaritan working that shift thought, "Hmm, okay."

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Now, I did sign a piece of paper saying I would never reveal what I heard,

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 but this guy is submitting to murdering a young woman, and how would I feel if he did it again?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 He got fired for that. He actually got fired from the Samaritans for revealing this information to the police.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And that's a touchy thing, because on one hand you want people to be able to trust the Samaritans,

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 but I mean, there's a line, obviously, if a guy's like, "I've killed and I'm gonna kill again,"

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 and you're like, "Hmm, I'd rather keep my job than report this dude."

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And this guy went to the cops and said, "Listen, I know I'm not supposed to reveal this information. It's fine.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I'll go get a job at Denny's for a while."

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Denny's in Scotland is actually a premier banking firm and not a delicious restaurant.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 The cops go, "Okay, they end up, long story short, arresting this guy. His name was James Ford."

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So Amanda Champion was 21 years old. James Ford's 26.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So pretty close. They begin, they arrest him, do the whole trial.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 He's found guilty, sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for this crime.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And the police have been like, "Listen, why'd you do it?" And he's like, "I don't know."

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Which is really the worst answer you can give. It's the most troubling answer.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 "I don't know." Just kind of shrugging his shoulders.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And so the police and the judge and everything was like, "This is such a heinous crime,

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and you don't know why you did it. That's more troubling than being like, 'Well, this X, Y, and Z happened.'

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Now they did, so, but apparently this guy had some fascination with people getting their throat slit.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 He never said why he did it. He just did it. He's just kind of something that happened.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 So he is found guilty. He goes to prison. 15 years to life.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 That'll happen, like I said, in about 2004, 2003, 2004.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So we're around 15 years at this point.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So now we're in the year 2019. It's November 2019.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Earlier last week, that doesn't make sense. Late last week.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Ousman Kahn.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Ousman Kahn is a convicted member of a terrorist group.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He was convicted in 2012 for plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange, the House of Parliament, US Embassy.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Convicted of these things, he's let out after eight years.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So 2012, he gets convicted of all this stuff. He just gets released earlier this year.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And he goes, 'Hmm, well, I did try blowing up those buildings, and that didn't work. Got caught.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So I could either change my worldview and accept other people as being equal to me, or tape knives to my hands.'

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Which he had a knife taped to each hand.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Which the first knife that you grab, you tape it to your hand, that's going to be pretty easy.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 How do you tape the second knife to your hand?

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And he's wearing a suicide vest. This was all over the news. You guys probably heard the story from this point on.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 This guy goes running into a fishmonger's hall in London.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 He starts trying to stab people, cut people, and trying to. He actually does.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He actually kills two people and slashes up a bunch of other people.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 In that building, in the fishmonger's hall at that moment, is a prison release program.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So they get the day off to go walk around the fishmonger's hall and be like, 'Lookit, fish! Remember the last time you guys ate fish?

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Oh wait, no you don't. You're in prison for murder.'

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he's like, 'Aww.' They're like, 'Look, this is a net. Just like the net the cops used to catch you. They're all, 'Aww.'

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So these prisoners are on day release. James Ford is there as well.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And a guy comes running in with knives taped to his hands, starts slashing people.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 James, murderer. I don't know whether or not he's repented to this, because this is all fairly new news.

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 New news, but he definitely just murdered a girl in cold blood.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's littered through in the middle of the forest and left her there to die.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 He is one of the first responders to this, helping fight the guy off, push him out of the--

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 because what the prisoners did was they pushed him-- this is kind of funny--

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 they pushed him out of the fishmonger's building.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And-- because he was trying to get upstairs. And then they just kind of let him be outside for a second.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But we'll get to that in a second, so anyways, they're fighting him.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And they-- I keep trying to say they were beating him off, but I'm trying to avoid saying that.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 That's why they keep these little pauses there.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 They're fighting him off. They push him out of the fishmonger's hall. They barricade him out.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So they can treat the people who have been attacked in there.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And James Ford gets down and starts trying to save a young woman's life.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Now, outside the fishmonger's hall, Usman Khan is like, "Well, that didn't go too well."

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But look at all of these other citizens of London. I will attack them as well.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So now he's running down the street. He's running down the bridge, actually.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And I thought this was probably my favorite part of this story, because now we're going to leave James Ford in the fishmonger's hall.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We're going to talk about this total piece of scum getting taken down, getting just wasted.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 This guy named Thomas Gray is driving down the road.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And he sees people running away from something, and then he sees a couple of people running towards a man who just seems to be like flailing wildly.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He's driving down the road with his buddy, and him and his buddy jump out of the car and they begin to rush this terrorist to take this terrorist out.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And he had this awesome quote, "I was brought up on rugby, and the rule is one in, all in.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I did what any Londoner would do and tried to put a stop to it."

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And that's what people just moshed this guy.

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Can't cut us all. Now, footage came out.

106
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Some dude hopped out from a local business, came out with a fire extinguisher, started blasting the dude in the face.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Another guy ended up leaving the fishmonger's hall.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So they've secured the fishmonger hall. They're treating the people who have been attacking there.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 He comes running out of the fishmonger hall, wielding a five foot long narwhal horn.

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So those magical mythical, they're not mythical, they're real, but those magical sea creatures that have the giant horn.

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They look like whales with giant horns sticking out of their head.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 This dude begins chasing this terrorist down the street. That's not a knife. This is a knife.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Perfect type moment. Begins like poking him. They're trying to contain this guy.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 They're spraying him in the face. People start jumping on top of him.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 They begin stepping on his hands to get the knives out, and that's when they realize the knives were taped.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And at that point, they don't know, at least as far when I was reading about this, there was some police driving down the street.

117
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And the question was, were they police responding to the scene who had been called in, or were they just on their random patrol just coming out of the street?

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Because people started waving them down, waving them down. The cops pull out, jump out with their guns.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 The terrorist, at this point, pulls his vest open, which again, I think would be difficult, with two knives taped to you.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Revealing a suicide vest, a bomb. And the cops say he has a bomb. People start scattering.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 There's a thing between being a hero and being an idiot.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So yeah, you can step on this guy's hands and poke him with a narwhal, but when he reveals a suicide vest, the best thing to do is to run away.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And as the people are running away, the cops shoot him. Dad, he dies. Huge news story, obviously.

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And right now, London's kind of afraid that there's going to be some copycat attacks because this guy was a martyr and all sorts of nonsense.

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He did end up killing two people, and he injured, I think, seven to nine people on top of that as well.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And the whole story, I think, is interesting. I love stories of citizens banding together to defeat evil.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I love stories of citizens banding together to help people, like, get cancer treatment or cats out of trees.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I love stories of communities coming together. But there's an odd footnote to this one, because obviously, there are people who are doing profiles on this,

129
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and they're like, "Look at this man. He murdered a girl 15 years ago, and now he saved or tried saving a girl's life. The girl actually died."

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But there's one group of people that aren't too impressed by his heroic actions. The family members have a man to champion,

131
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and they are coming out in the media, and they're like, "He is not a hero."

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And you have this family who still has this really raw wound of losing their daughter to a senseless murder.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And a man who still has never really revealed why he murdered this girl.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 So maybe it could have been some sort of fetish thing. Might want to see what it was like to take a human life, that type of nonsense we don't know.

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So is he a hero? Is he a convict who happened to be in the right place at the right time?

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Has he reformed and decided, "I took a life once, and now that I'm given the opportunity, I want to save a life"?

137
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Or did he enjoy watching another woman die? Who knows?

138
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 It's probably not the last one. That's a little dark. That's a little dark.

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But it's a debate going on right now. Who is a hero? Can you...

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I believe you can have a redemption arc, obviously, but for someone to senselessly murder someone with no rhyme or reason,

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 15 years later, can they be hailed a hero? Interesting question. Interesting question.

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Let's go ahead, though. We're going to leave behind those interesting questions, and we're going to move on to the Scrabble story.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 We're headed to France. In France, there's a guy named Michael Chiron, which is interesting, because this story is pretty much a first-person story.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And it's nice to have a real name. It's nice to have a real name. This guy's written a book about this.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 So there's no anonymity. This guy put it all on the line to tell the story.

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So that's always a nice change of pace. And he wrote a book. He wrote a book in French.

147
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm sure it's been translated to a real language by now, but it was called "I Was Possessed."

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 "I Was Possessed," and this is Michael Chiron's story.

149
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 In the 80s, he was a teacher for a group of mentally disabled kids.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 So he comes to work each day and does the Lord's work.

151
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Because you have these kids that are having a hard time just interacting in society.

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 He shows up very patient, takes the time to teach these kids how to learn.

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 At this point, he is no longer a Catholic. So in the 80s, he goes, "You know what?

154
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 That Catholicism, eating the brad, drinking the wine, praying all the time.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Lame. I am a child." And he actually talked about this.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 He said, like, in the 60s, it was like the revolution, like the cultural revolution.

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 He made him realize how square religion was, how lame it was.

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I'm an atheist. I'm an atheist now. I don't believe in the Sky Fairy God, all that nonsense.

159
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And he is more into spiritualism. Not even into spiritualism.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 He's just open to fun ideas. And his friends go, "Hey, man. Hey, you want to do something groovy?"

161
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And he's like, "Dude, it's the 1980s. Why are you talking about that?"

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 "Because we're stuck in the past, man."

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Let's do something awesome.

164
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 We have a Scrabble. We're going to lay out the Scrabble stuff.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And he's like, "Scrabble? Awesome. My favorite game."

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Here's a word, Toblerone. And they're like, "No, we're not playing Scrabble."

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And I don't think Toblerone counts. But we're going to put out these Scrabble pieces.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And we have a Pendulum. And we're going to hang it over.

169
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 We're going to ask questions like, "What should I put on my spaghetti saucer?"

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Or actual real questions like, "Should I continue dating my husband?"

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Or, "Should I go out and date you?"

172
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And he's like, "Oh, he's blowing on the Pendulum. He's making it go, 'Yes, yes, date me.'"

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 But anyway, so the friends get together and they're just asking stupid questions.

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 There is such a... It's funny because fortune telling is so stupid, but so many people fall for it.

175
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I think people want answers. I think it plays into a deep-seated need of wanting to know answers and the truth and all that sort of stuff.

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So anyways, it's just funny that I get at like kids play with cootie catchers, you know, like pick three.

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Okay, pick one, four, eight, or nine. Nine.

178
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You know, those little pieces of paper. And then you open it up and it says, "You stink."

179
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You're like, "That's not the future. That's right now. I totally know I stink."

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I can get kids doing that, but when you have adults, when you have college educated people with a bunch of scrabble pieces and a Pendulum, it's quite ridiculous.

181
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 But anyway, so he's doing this. Michael is doing this.

182
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And he said, "Yeah, you know, it was fun. Didn't really get much from it."

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So now we're in 1993. He's divorced at this point. He doesn't have anyone.

184
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 He's lonely, which is probably the worst mental state a human can be in.

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And so, yeah, it's like crippling almost. And it's, I'm actually fine, personally fine with it, but I know for a lot of people, it's really hard for them to not have somebody.

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 For me, it's the opposite. I'd rather not have somebody so I can do whatever I want.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 That's the way you got to look at it. But anyways, he was the other 99% of humanity who needs like that soulmate and he doesn't know what to do.

188
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So he goes, and that's clue number one. Let's see if I remember these clues.

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 He goes, "You know what? I'm going to try that scrabble thing again."

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I remember it was kind of fun and I don't got anything else to do.

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So I'll just grab some red wine. In France, it comes out of the water tap.

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You just turn on the faucet. Red wine comes out.

193
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Now I'm going to get out my scrabble pieces. I wonder if he had a game of scrabble.

194
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I wonder if he had to go to Target and buy a scrabble board and then find a Pendulum shop.

195
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 He's like, "Ahh!" He's driving all the way across the countryside to Pendulum's RS.

196
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Anyways, he does lay out all the scrabble tiles he puts out the Pendulum.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 He's making it go, "Meow."

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And he did it and he said it felt different this time.

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Like, I wasn't getting answers to the questions I was asking, but it felt...

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I had a different energy this time than when I was doing it, you know, a decade earlier with my friends.

201
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 This felt weird.

202
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But he did it over and over and over again. He says he did it 10 days straight.

203
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He would get off work, he'd come home, he'd lay out his scrabble pieces,

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 and he would just hold the Pendulum over and it would go, "Will I find true love?"

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And the Pendulum would go, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And the Pendulum would go, "Potato." And he's like, "What? That doesn't even make sense." But just he felt differently doing this.

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Then one day he comes home, he's eating a potato, he's eating fries, he's eating all every potato product he can find.

208
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 He's, you know, because maybe it's a clue. He's holding the Pendulum up.

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 He's all greasy now from French fry grease, which over there they're just called fries.

210
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And the Pendulum's like, "Wrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 An internal monologue. We're going to talk about that in a later episode, but...

212
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 That voice that you have in your head being like, "Should I have carrots?" No, no, no, carrots are disgusting.

213
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Maybe I should go get a Hershey bar. No, you don't want to get a Hershey bar either.

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You know, like that monologue. Not everyone has that.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But that's also distinct from what this guy was hearing. Martin said he was hearing the voices in his head, in his chest, and in his throat.

216
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And they're talking to him now as a separate meme.

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Now, he is not a Catholic. He doesn't believe in God, but at the same time, he knows all of those stories.

218
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So when the voices at one point say, "It is the devil speaking," and begins talking about a kingdom and an emperor,

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 he obviously doesn't forget the lessons of Catholicism and God versus Satan and the demons and princes and principalities and all that stuff.

220
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But he doesn't believe in those things.

221
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And that's clue number two. What was clue number one? I don't know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember. Being lonely.

222
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Clue number two was he doesn't believe in any of these things.

223
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So when they're using terminology that he remembers from Bible school, he totally brushes it off.

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 But he ends up getting panicked because he's hearing these voices and he hears it as the devil speaking,

225
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 but he's like, "Devil's not real. I just must be having some sort of mental breakdown."

226
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Throws the pendulum away, plays a couple of games of Scrabble, and then goes to bed. He doesn't really play games of Scrabble.

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 But I think it's funny. He threw the pendulum away. Why didn't he throw the Scrabble board away?

228
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 He wakes up the next morning. He hears a voice again.

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "Yesterday we scared you, but now we will tell you the truth."

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And this is where they tell him that they were sent by their king, that they are part of what's known as the first kingdom.

231
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And he asks, this dialogue goes on for quite a while. It goes on for months.

232
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But he goes, "What are you guys made of?" Because he can obviously feel them inside of his body.

233
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 So he's not seeing them as some sort of outside creature.

234
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 He asks, "What are you guys made of? Like, how are you guys inside of me?"

235
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And they say this. This is their quote. "You don't know that, but we are made of ions of particles."

236
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And that's an interesting statement, because obviously at this point there's two parts of this audience who's listening to the story.

237
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 One, people who believe in demons, or believe in possession, and people who don't.

238
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And just like hearing stories like this. The podcast has a pretty diverse audience as far as that goes.

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Now, I believe in this type of stuff. So when I read that, I thought there was an engine.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Someone who doesn't believe in that goes, "Oh, he's making it up, or he's having some sort of mental breakdown,

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 or he can't make up something that you don't understand."

242
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And I am in the other camp where I believe this stuff is real, but I think the ending part is the same.

243
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 A demon who has possessed you, and you ask a question that's beyond human comprehension,

244
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 the demon would respond, "You don't know that." And I think that's more of a metaphysical level.

245
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Like, you don't know that. You have no comprehension for what I am about to describe to you,

246
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 so I'm going to break it down in Earth language, and that's, "I made up ions and particles."

247
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Whereas if it possessed some hyperintelligent alien, it'd be like, "Oh, yeah, dude.

248
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Remember that thing you guys discovered a couple years ago in that laboratory? I made up that.

249
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I made up pure Aletheakiroma."

250
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So I thought that was an interesting answer. It wasn't like, "Oh, we are made up of spirits of the dead,

251
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 or we are made up of the universe." It's, "You don't know that."

252
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You don't know that, but to put it simple, we're made of ions and particles.

253
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 These voices kept telling him they're training him. He's going to be trained.

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He's going to have unlocked his potentialities, as the term they kept using. Potentialities.

255
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He was chosen, and when he was ready, he would help bring more people to their king.

256
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Now, obviously, again, anyone with any sort of background, even a passing background in the Bible, or Bible stories, goes,

257
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 "Pretty sure it's Satan who was the king of hell, and he has these demons, and he wants more souls, or more people to join him."

258
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Like, even if you only have a Saturday morning cartoon level understanding of the fight between God and Satan,

259
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 that shouldn't be a surprise to you.

260
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But this guy, Michael, is so invested in being an atheist, and actively believing that these guys don't exist,

261
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 that when anything pops up, that is a red flag, i.e. being called the devil, that's probably the biggest red flag,

262
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 but talking about kings, and talking about, "You're going to help bring people to our leader,"

263
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 he's so avowed, he's so far from believing that God exists, and none of this stuff is setting off red flags.

264
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And the voices are actively telling him, "God doesn't exist. We are something else, but God doesn't exist."

265
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Jesus was a real guy, but he was just a dude, he wasn't the son of God or anything like that.

266
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It's feeding into his beliefs that he already has about all these things.

267
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 To unlock his potentialities, first off, they start showing him card tricks.

268
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 He'd get a deck of cards, and he'd hold a card up, and the voice in the head would go, "Ace of Spades."

269
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He'd go, "Ace of Spades!" and he throws it down.

270
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 The voices are like, "Please don't do that. Quit telling him that, Joe."

271
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He pulls another card up, and the voices are like, "We saw you pick up the Ace of Spades again."

272
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 He's all, "Ace of Spades!" and at this point, the demons are like, "Is there anyone else we can possess?"

273
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 He's holding up the cards, and the voices would say, "King of Hearts, get a new card."

274
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So anyways, that's how it starts off. He says that the voices were allowing me, like,

275
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 "I would hold up a card, the voice would predict the card."

276
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 You're like, "Jayce, we got it. We got it. Move on to the next thing."

277
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He said that they started making his palate bleed, and not his wooden palate.

278
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So he has in the back his mouth, like at the top of his mouth, he would just start bleeding.

279
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 He said, "I can only eat soft foods for a week. Everything else is just super painful."

280
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 They also, and this isn't where we get into the impossible.

281
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So all of this stuff has been a slow hearing voice. People do that, unfortunately, all the time.

282
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 That's other than their internal monologue.

283
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Guessing cards, I can do that. Anyone can do that.

284
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I mean, not with 100% accuracy, but people can get up to 50%.

285
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And then, what was the other stuff? Oh yeah, back pain, bleeding mouth palate.

286
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Definitely stuff you want to go into the doctor for, but not supernatural.

287
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Now we're going to get into this stuff.

288
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 He said that the demons had him drink 15 gallons of water.

289
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Sorry, that's not true. 15 liters of water a day.

290
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I'm pretty sure there's a big difference between those two, but that's still a lot.

291
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 That's still an inhuman amount of water to be able to drink.

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Now, he said that I've been told by doctors after all this happened that that should have killed me.

293
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But he said the demons needed it.

294
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Here's a quote from him. I found this very fascinating. Here's a quote.

295
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 "Water gave them strength. A kind of electric strength. I gave them power by drinking. Hydrogen gave them power.

296
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I believe there is something scientific behind this."

297
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 So obviously we don't know if any of this is true.

298
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I'm assuming that this story is true. At least I believe this guy is telling the truth.

299
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And we can quibble about whether or not it was 15 liters or 5 liters and he miscounted,

300
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 or whether or not he was having schizophrenic episode, or he was possessed by demons.

301
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I'm saying that I think the series of events happened.

302
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I believe they happened the way he's telling them, but you can also say, "No, no, that doesn't make sense.

303
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I think it's more likely this." But what I mean by that is that sometimes these narratives are completely made up.

304
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's pure fiction. I believe that these events happened in some form.

305
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I think we can compromise on that one.

306
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 But anyways, when I read that, I was researching this story around the same time I was doing the story on Haditha Dam.

307
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Episode I covered last week, which is an interesting parallel, because that is a hydroelectric dam

308
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 built on top of what is supposedly the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

309
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And I thought, "Hmm, that's interesting notes. That's interesting fact."

310
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I don't think it's fact, because it's probably made up, but I said several times in that episode,

311
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 "Why would you build a dam on top of a bunch of demons?"

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Like, why would the demons let you build a dam on top of them, I think is what I said.

313
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And the idea was, Haditha Dam is some sort of prison for these spirits.

314
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It could be because they're just getting pure hydroelectric energy pushed on them every single day.

315
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 It's only making them more and more powerful.

316
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Their prison, quote-unquote, is literally underneath what powers demonic forces.

317
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 So I kept that little detail hidden from that episode, because I wanted to reveal it on this one.

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 But I think that's an interesting clue.

319
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He also started to have the ability to change his appearance.

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And you're like, "Jason, I can do that. It's called changing my clothes. It's called shaving."

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 No, the demons would say, "You want your potentialities unlocked."

322
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And he'd be like, "Yeah, yeah, I guess."

323
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 I mean, why are you such a weird word?

324
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And they're like, "Touch your chin. Touch your chin."

325
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And he put his fingers on his chin and his bone was like bubble gum.

326
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It just went [blows]

327
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And his fingers like sank into the flesh of his skin.

328
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He said he could push on his face and it was like moving dough around.

329
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And he looked in the mirror and he had a different face.

330
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Like, he could go [blows]

331
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 and move and his forehead would be slightly over and make his eyes bigger.

332
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 It's obviously freaking him out. He's panicked at this point.

333
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And then the next day his face would return to normal.

334
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Which is convenient if you're a skeptic because otherwise you could be like,

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "Hey, why are you in Michael's scene?"

336
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 He's like, "Oh, no, no, I'm really Michael. I just have been possessed by a bunch of dudes."

337
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And the boss is like, "Don't even finish. You're fired."

338
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 But I mean, it's convenient for a skeptic because they're like,

339
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 "Well, why didn't he take photos of himself with all these different faces?"

340
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 He looks like Scarlett Johansson.

341
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 He looks like the cast of Avengers, but it's just him. All these different faces.

342
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Anyways, he's at this point, he's at the verge of suicide.

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 He's tired of moving his face around. He had enough fun doing that.

344
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He's like, "I'm gonna turn myself into a sexy woman."

345
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And he's like, "Ooh, Michael, you're so cute."

346
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And the voices are like, "Ah, good hitting on yourself."

347
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But eventually he gets tired of all these games.

348
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I wouldn't. I would be like, "Oh, I'm sending Tinder profiles to have myself to me."

349
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 "Hi, Jason. Oh, Jay Cena. You swiped to Ryan. That's so cute."

350
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Anyways, anyways.

351
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 He, this go-back-to-depressing thing, I always have to do a joke before this stuff.

352
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 He wants to kill himself. He wants to commit suicide.

353
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He can't get these things out of his head.

354
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And he goes, what happened was he would say, "I'm gonna kill myself."

355
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And then he would start the process of killing himself.

356
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And the voices would stop talking.

357
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 He'd be like, "Oh, well, maybe they're not gonna kill myself. Maybe I'm not gonna do that."

358
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And then eventually the voices would come back.

359
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So they were tormenting him. They did not want him to kill himself.

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 At one point he's going to the railroad tracks and the voices disappear.

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And he has this moment of clarity.

362
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And he goes, "I don't know why I thought of this, because I don't believe in this stuff at all."

363
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 "I didn't know what was going on, but I don't believe in angels or demons or God."

364
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "I don't believe it. I think they're childhood fairy tales that are told to gollible people to get money."

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 "I don't believe it. But I also can't stand this mania going on. I'm gonna kill myself."

366
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And as he's walking out of the train tracks, he has this moment of clarity.

367
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And a voice, he hears a voice, not like hears a voice, but he gets a thought.

368
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Not gonna say it was God or anything like that. He gets a thought.

369
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 "Go see an exorcist."

370
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He's like, "What?"

371
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "Exorcist? That's a Catholic thing. They're like demons. I don't have demons. Why would I need to see an exorcist?"

372
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 But he thought about it. He's like, "Well, what am I gonna have to lose? I'm about to get hit by a train."

373
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 "What am I gonna have to lose?"

374
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 The voices come back and they're like, "Hey, man."

375
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "Hey, dude, I know it like me and you have been together."

376
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 At this point, it's been nine months. We've been together for nine months.

377
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Remember we had our half anniversary a couple months ago? It's you and me. It's you and me.

378
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 You don't need to see an exorcist. You don't want to see an exorcist.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Why? I mean, what's it gonna hurt?

380
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Again, I've been attempting suicide for a couple of weeks now.

381
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Like, listen, man, here's the detail. If you go to the exorcist, we're gonna have to leave because, see, God exists.

382
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And all that stuff was true. And we're demons and we're inside of you.

383
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 So this thing isn't going to last if you go to an exorcist.

384
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Yeah. Sorry about telling you you were right about God not existing.

385
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Hope we can still be friends. Of course we're gonna be friends. We've possessed you.

386
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 At this point, he gets super infuriated. And I believe there's some information left out of this narrative.

387
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But he says, "I was infuriated." He goes, "I had walked so far down the path of sin.

388
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 I didn't believe God existed when I got possessed. These spiritual, outside, alien-like beings were convincing me that I was right that God didn't exist.

389
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Now I'm being told God does exist and I had already walked too far down the road of sin. I feel like I could not be forgiven."

390
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And I think that he did some really... I think he did worse stuff than touching his face and flipping cards around him.

391
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 He probably got involved in some really, really dark, creepy stuff in this nine months.

392
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 He's like, "Hey man, you only live once. Humanity, you know, the heat death in the universe, everything's going to disappear. Human, just experience whatever you want now because there's just not going to be anything left when you die."

393
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He probably did some really, really dark things in that time period.

394
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Now he's being told that God exists, that Jesus exists, that what he has in him is demons.

395
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And all of the great potentialities in him being the chosen one and leading people to the king, which he now realizes actually is Satan,

396
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 will go away if he goes through an exorcist. But he does say, "Yes, I've done all this horrible stuff and I have been possessed."

397
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But I just cannot continue. He goes through an exorcist. The exorcist begins his... exorcism, his magical little thing.

398
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I don't really know what it would fall into if you would describe it as magical or what, but he has multiple demons in him.

399
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And he has the biggest, strongest demons pulled out, but the little demons were left behind.

400
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And it's funny because when you watch, when you... I don't really know, I have a base knowledge of exorcisms.

401
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 You always imagine that exorcism, like, does the job. When you hire someone to kill gophers in your yard,

402
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 he doesn't go, "Well, you know, I killed the biggest ones, but the little ones are still there."

403
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 No, you'd be like, "Go kill the little ones! Don't just kill big ones, kill them all!"

404
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 So, but we covered in Michael Taylor that was the other thing, the exorcist did this big exorcism and left three demons in the guy.

405
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It was like the demons of murder, anger, and like intolerance or something like that.

406
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I guess that would be minor compared to murder and anger.

407
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And then Michael Taylor killed his wife and ripped his poodle in half that night.

408
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Or that morning, actually. Didn't wait until the spooky, spooky nighttime.

409
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 So we've had exorcisms before where they pull only part of them out.

410
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Michael Taylor, they just ran out of time. They're like, "Oh, just... he has to go home and rest for 12 hours, and then we'll get the murder demon out of him."

411
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 This one, they're like, "Well, we pulled the big ones out, but the little ones are still attached in him."

412
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And Michael, at one point, you're like, "Oh, so is this dude still possessed?"

413
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 He's writing the book and every show often there's another voice being like, "Don't listen to this room! God doesn't exist!"

414
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And then it's like, editors note, the demon took over.

415
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 No, he said that the little demons were still inside of him, and then one day he was in the bathroom.

416
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 He looks in the mirror and he sees the image of Mother Mary appear in the mirror.

417
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And he's like, "Oh, that's kind of weird. Did not expect to see that in the morning."

418
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And then Mother Mary fades away and then he sees the reflection of his own mother who's passed away up here in the mirror.

419
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And then after that, all the demons have disappeared. And that's where we're at right now.

420
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 So, it's an interesting... we laid out a couple clues here, and it's an interesting story.

421
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 One, we had a guy who was lonely. He was looking for something in his life.

422
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And I don't remember the other two clues. The point... the point is... don't you love and prompt two-fodcasting?

423
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 The point is this. I think the other... I don't remember. The point is this.

424
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 That he really left himself open to be possessed.

425
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I think this story is quite frightening because he's just goofing off with a Scrabble board and a pendulum,

426
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 and he invites these demons into his body. And, I mean, you can do that on accident.

427
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 You can be carrying your pendulum collection over your kids'... kids are playing Scrabble on the ground.

428
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 You're like, "I got this pendulum in 1999 from Arizona." And it's like accidentally spinning around on top of the Scrabble board.

429
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 But at the same time, people can have like, "Oh, let's do Weegee Board or Cootie Catchers or Charlie Charlie or whatever."

430
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And not be possessed at all. This guy had multiple things.

431
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 One, he didn't believe in God. He thought it was all fictional.

432
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He was lonely. He was looking for something he had to void in his life.

433
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 He turned to answers that were not of this earth. You know, like, "Jason, isn't that prayer?"

434
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 And I would say, "Shut up, dude. So anyways..." Yes, yes. Same thing, but you're communicating with a different entity.

435
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 This guy, he didn't believe... he didn't believe that God existed.

436
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 He was lonely. He had a hole in his life. He was looking to fill. He filled it with something.

437
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And then once these red flags started popping up, i.e., being possessed hearing voices, all this stuff, he didn't believe it.

438
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And it wasn't until the very end where he got that little nugget in his head going, "Yeah, go see an exorcist.

439
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You're gonna kill yourself anyways. So what are you gonna... what's it gonna hurt?"

440
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 That he got all these demons gotten out of his body, and he goes on to write this book.

441
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 "Spooky if true." Spooky if true.

442
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Because those are really common things to happen. People can get lonely.

443
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 I think everyone gets lonely to a certain degree, but you can get like that heart-wrenching loneliness.

444
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And when you're at that level of loneliness, any thing will do. Any human contact will do.

445
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And maybe it doesn't even have to be human.

446
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And then if you couple that with having a weak spiritual base and an interest in the paranormal, you might be looking at some trouble yourself.

447
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 So dear listeners, my advice to you is stay away from contacting the other side.

448
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 It's cliche, but it's true. When you send a call out into the darkness, you have no idea who's going to respond.

449
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
