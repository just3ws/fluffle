1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Did a witch

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 Enactor vengeance against a small town in Mississippi?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,880
 And then we take a look at

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:17,080
 One of the newest theories to come out on the internet was 9/11 really a time travel experiment and and hold on hold

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,920
 I'm not done yet and

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,200
 I have found an audio clip that'll blow your mind today on Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
 I'm a rock big gal

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:40,420
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,640
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys really are having a great day

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 hope everyone is safe and

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,160
 Yeah, I just hope everything's working out

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,720
 So

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,800
 Let's go ahead and jump into our first story

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,480
 We're just gonna go right into this so let's hop on board the carpenter copter

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,440
 We are going to a small little town

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
 Somewhere in Mississippi. I don't know exactly where it's at

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,600
 But I do know it's along the Yazoo River because and the town is called Yazoo

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,200
 So pretty easy to find you're just gonna fly around till we see a river and then land and ask if this is the Yazoo River

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,560
 And when the people are like no, we just keep flying around. It can't be that many rivers in Mississippi, right?

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,160
 So as we're flying around we also have to go back in time. So

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,800
 We're sure I don't know what sound effects I've done before but anyways all of them all the sound effects play at once we are in the year

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,000
 1884 there's a witch living on the edge of town and

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,680
 Fishermen because she lived on the edge of town towns by a river ergo. She lives by the river, right?

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,960
 Fishermen go out to fish and

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,720
 What they found out was?

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,640
 Fishermen weren't coming back from fishing and the town sheriff is sitting there in that wooden chair that rocks a rocking chair

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,680
 Rocking to rocking chair in his police station because he's super casual boots up on the desk twirling his gun and

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,560
 People are like hey Jimmy Jimmy Joey Fisherman hasn't come back from fishing and I

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,680
 Forgot the cops name I made up. We'll just call him Jerry. Maybe that's the same name

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,120
 I don't remember and and Officer Jerry Sheriff Jerry goes

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,720
 No, wait. Well, I'm rocking in my chair right now

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,460
 I'll get it off work it out later and people leave and then the next day someone else comes back and they go

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,500
 Samuel the fishermen the old dude who fishes all the time. He's gone

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,200
 Sheriff Jerry is like that's a little suspicious and this goes on

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,880
 He's not very good cop if you're not picking up on this. He's not very good cop, but eventually

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,900
 After this half the fishermen are gone. He's like I should go find out what's going on down there

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:55,280
 So the sheriff finally gets out of his rocking chair and gets all suited up and goes out to the witch district to find out

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,600
 Actually, he doesn't go to the witch district. He doesn't know the which has anything to do with shit

39
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,800
 He goes to the river to look for the fishermen and can't find any fishermen

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
 He's like that's interesting and so then the witches district is right next to it

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,360
 He's like, oh, I got to go pick up that I have new right I want to cut through the witches district by some I knew

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,360
 He's walking through the witches district witches are like curses curses. They got carts full of like goblins in them

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,100
 He's like, I don't need any of those but as he's looking through the witches district

44
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,740
 He starts finding chopped up people and he's like, ah, I need to find out who's chopping up these bodies

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
 And not only were these bodies being chopped up

46
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,540
 There were signs of torture and these were the fishermen if it wasn't obvious the fishermen were showing up to fish on the lake

47
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,420
 and then the witch would get them and torture them and

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,580
 Then chop them up. Well, I don't even know if she chopped them up

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,440
 Okay, the point is is she tortured them and murdered them. I don't know where the the dismemberment came from

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:55,660
 Anyways, which runs which takes off because she realizes she's done for she's been caught by officer Sheriff Jerry

51
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,680
 She's been caught by Sheriff Jerry. So there's a pursuit. There's a musical montage. She's like running through the jungle

52
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,720
 They're playing some 80s song 1884 song

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,960
 So it's like a musical montage with a banjo and as they're moving through the jungle

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,120
 forest

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,860
 Forest I got caught up in my own story as I run into the forest the witch is like looking behind her and she sees Sheriff Jerry

56
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,640
 Getting closer and closer and like song highway to the danger zone

57
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:29,220
 Going on she's like where's that music coming from she's running and she jumps into quicksand

58
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:38,260
 And she's about way steep in quicksand right and the sheriff gets there and his deputies have magically appeared and they show up and

59
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,160
 She turns around she turns around as she's in the quicksand and she raises her fist of them and she says in 20 years

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,800
 I will return and burn this town to the ground

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,960
 Drowns in the quicksand okay the sheriff's like oh

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,440
 Well in that case I don't have to do any more investigation

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,840
 My only witness who I never questioned drowned in quicksand that she must have been responsible for all of these murders, right?

64
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,900
 We jump ahead

65
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,200
 spoiler alert 20 years May 25th 1904 a

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,640
 massive fire rips through the town of Yazoo huge fire

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,860
 324 buildings burned and

68
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,740
 Nobody to this day knew how the fire started the

69
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,320
 The people said that there was a young couple getting married and somehow they think that the fire may have started there

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,680
 But it moved through the town the people said it looked like it was super naturally

71
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,860
 Controlled as it jumped from building to building and going inside and then knocking on a door and opening it walking

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,060
 Little flame walking inside and people waking people up and they're like on the jump out the window

73
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,420
 And then the flames like laughs and then jumps to the other building gets on a bus drives around town

74
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,280
 Do people had no idea how this fire spread and here's a quote you go Jason. It's just the wind

75
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,080
 Wind makes fire do stuff and two idiots wind seems supernatural. Ah, huh?

76
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,800
 Stop who's you can't debunk this story the story's iron glad quote here's an quote

77
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,980
 I found on an article quote area weather reports

78
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,180
 From May 25th 1904 make no mentions of high winds in the area

79
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,720
 Case closed obviously because if I can't trust the weather report written in 1904

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,160
 What can you trust and especially if I can't fight me if I can't trust a website making such a bold claim then

81
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,600
 Then who can I trust?

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,280
 Anyways, that's the claim day after the fire

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,660
 Everyone goes to the town cemetery as you do because your first inclination is to check on the witch

84
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,020
 224 buildings burned remember, but the first thing you want to do is go to the graveyard

85
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,700
 Check on the grave of the witch and when they got to the grave of the witch

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,020
 They noticed that the chains that were wrapped around the grave site

87
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,760
 So there's like four posts and there's chains around them were broken. It's like the witch

88
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,020
 Broke the chains and escaped see the chains were put there to keep you in place, right?

89
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,680
 Because what else could keep a ghost in place coming out of a grave?

90
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,880
 Than four chains not like she could shimmy under them

91
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,320
 Not like she could just float under them not like she could just pop out of someone else's grave because she's a ghost, right?

92
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,000
 She just go through the ground pop out of someone else's grave. They saw that the chains were broke and

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,560
 Here's our final statement on this story

94
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,640
 Current local lore says that when all of the chains are gone from her grave

95
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,320
 The witch will return again to exact her revenge on Yazoo City to this day our cemetery

96
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,100
 Sextons sexy are similar not the cemetery part not the cemetery think about it sex tons

97
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,080
 You know ton of sex. I have no idea what a sex then is to this day our cemetery sex

98
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,560
 Then it might be something super gross actually

99
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,980
 Maybe like 80 year old men like who inject stuff into bodies on with a quote to this day

100
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,820
 Our cemetery sex and are very careful to keep the chains repaired and in place though

101
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,340
 They are often broken again very soon after being repaired

102
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,800
 That's the story of the witch of Yazoo now there are a lot of people who believe this story and

103
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,240
 I wanted to highlight this story for two reasons one because I love the idea of people falling in a quicksand

104
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,200
 I think that's hilarious. That's not the only reason I didn't talk about this for 10 minutes

105
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,300
 Just because I wanted to tell a story about quicksand the story is

106
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,040
 Stupid and and the thing and listen here's the thing

107
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,240
 I might as well talk about this right now because I think you can obviously tell there's a bit of a different tone to the episode today

108
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,740
 It was a rough weekend

109
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,340
 We had a lot of bad news this weekend and it was funny because when I wanted to do this episode

110
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,180
 I said let me try to find some stuff that's kind of funny

111
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,180
 And then I realized that I would probably be better suited if I found stories that made me mad

112
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,660
 Because I'm a little just it's just sucks like it's just been such a bad news day

113
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,820
 That I was like yeah, so I was yeah

114
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:17,560
 Anyways, let's look into this legend again a lot of people believe in this story, but let's take a look at and there's urban legends

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 I've talked about like the wandering busts of Philadelphia, which I said this is urban legend and it's fake

116
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,760
 But it says something to us. I've talked about the bunny man's story a couple episodes back

117
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,200
 Same thing but that story had some basis and truth

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,840
 Let's look at this story here from the point of view of a human being with brain cells

119
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,640
 There's a witch murdering fisherman. She's able to get away with him a long time

120
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,020
 She tortured and killed him. How do they know?

121
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,100
 How do they know she tortured him? How do they know she killed him?

122
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
 None of the details are ever revealed in any of these things

123
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,220
 Sheriff goes out to the witch's hut goes to arrest her. She takes off. That's a rational

124
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,100
 That's a rational part of the story

125
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,220
 That is what would happen in real life if you were if you were murdering people cops showed up

126
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,620
 You're gonna run or if you were into any nefarious activities or just a witch in 1884 and when just cops show up outside your house

127
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,000
 You're gonna run that part makes sense. She runs and she falls in quicksand and then she turns around and says in 20 years

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,360
 I'm gonna burn your town to the ground or something like that drowns and the sheriff is just watching the whole thing

129
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,320
 Here's my question. Why would the sheriff tell anyone that story? Why would he he goes back in a town?

130
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,080
 They're like, hey Jerry, did you get the way? She's like no, but she didn't tell us. We're all doomed to die in 20 years

131
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
 Like why would you tell that part of the story?

132
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,020
 You're not gonna spread that version around town because people are already petrified that this witch has murdered a bunch of people also

133
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,020
 No record of anyone being tortured or murdered in this city back then so then they

134
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,680
 The fire starts is burnt. There was actually a fire and I think that shows I think that tells you why this story was created

135
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,500
 But there was actually a fire bunch of buildings war burned

136
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,340
 Not a ton of casualties actually any casualties that I could have could see but I could be wrong on that there could have been

137
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,560
 Three or four or whatever. It's tragic. I'm not saying that's an okay number, but

138
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,600
 The the town burns down that that's true and then the next day they go to the graveyard and they go to her grave with the chain

139
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,140
 Stuff like that. How do they get the body out of the quicksand?

140
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,120
 Why would they get the body out of the quicksand if they dug up a witch out of the quicksand if they decided to go through all that

141
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,320
 Effort to get an old dead woman out of sandy water

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,880
 Why would you then take her to your graveyard in town and bury her and put chains around it?

143
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,900
 And don't tell me it's protect us from her magic because it would have been easier just to a lever in the quicksand

144
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,660
 If you actually thought she was magical you could have cremated her because she didn't have any family friends

145
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,460
 No one was gonna care or you put her in unmarked grave

146
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:47,140
 The truth of the matter is nobody knows who's buried in that grave that has the chains around it and then the idea of

147
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:54,160
 Any town official who says we have to prepare these chains or the witch will destroy us all should

148
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,740
 Automatically lose their seat any town official who says we need to keep these these

149
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:07,560
 Chains repaired otherwise will be destroyed is would not be a town official for long and again. Let's put logic to the story

150
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,780
 Do you have chains wrapped around a grave that keep breaking right?

151
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,780
 And really I mean I dispute the first off I dispute the fact that any part of the story is real except for the fire

152
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:27,360
 I definitely dispute the fact that to these days these chains keep breaking if I'm wrong and these chains keep breaking

153
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,300
 Buy chains from somebody else because if any other if you bought if you had a car that kept breaking down

154
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,820
 You're not gonna be like well if I let it break down all the way witches are gonna destroy me

155
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,060
 I gotta keep repairing this car. No, you would sell the car or return it

156
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,980
 You wouldn't just keep repairing that car over and over again on the off chance that the one day you decide to take it

157
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,300
 So the auto lot a bunch of witches come out of it that is probably one of the most stone

158
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,620
 Here's the thing. There's two different audiences for urban legends twelve-year-old kids and idiots

159
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,460
 I do enjoy reading urban legends because it speaks to me as a I have the thought process of a 12-year-old kid

160
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,060
 When I initially am reading it, I'm thinking oh, that's you know, which which in the quicksand

161
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,620
 Oh, it's kind of cool which quicksand which but then the second I finish it or actually this story while I was reading

162
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,460
 I was like that doesn't make sense like why did they get her body out of their way to me and idiots people who go

163
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,180
 Oh, no, that's totally true. I believe it my cousin saw the witches ghost

164
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,100
 He was also trapped in quicksand. He turned to the side and there was a witch standing, you know

165
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:39,000
 I mean like there's a certain point where the entertainment factor of a story just flat out becomes insulting some

166
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,740
 urban legends are

167
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,540
 Transformers 3 which means it's very well crafted and tells a good story. You know, it's not real, but it's entertaining

168
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:56,060
 Some urban legends, however, are Transformers 5 which really insult your intelligence and you end the end you feel bad that you

169
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,300
 Spent any amount of time listening to this one was a Transformers 5 that'll be our new ranking system for urban legends

170
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:09,900
 Just I'm disappointed in you town of Yazoo. So yeah, that is the story to which he has who was that it was that

171
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,100
 Appeal to you was it were you not entertained? I

172
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,900
 Have to say I have to say at this point that that was pretty cathartic

173
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,440
 To do to basically take some some towns urban legend a town that no one's ever heard of and

174
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,780
 Just written some pieces that did make me feel a little bit better

175
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,460
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story now our next story

176
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,660
 Hopefully will be less irritating to me

177
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:44,120
 We're going to talk about the tried the true the you can't kill it with fire conspiracy keeps coming back to life

178
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,340
 9/11 now 9/11 we I we've talked about on the show a hundred times

179
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,820
 It's basically the granddaddy of conspiracy theories used to be JFK, but that's not that's not really relevant anymore

180
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,300
 That's what your that's your grandpa's conspiracy theory, but 9/11 was 18 years ago

181
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,820
 So people keep coming out with conspiracy theories about 9/11 and they get dumber

182
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,380
 They get dumber and dumber and dumber and dumber as time goes on and you think Jason

183
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,940
 I think you're just still a little wound up that which cast a spell on you. No, that's not the case. She might have but

184
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,780
 There's a video out there right now called 9/11 planes traveled in time

185
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,360
 No, oh by the way, no slash between the 9/11 so technically he's saying

186
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,880
 9/11 planes traveled in time, but that's nitpicking and this video is so ridiculous

187
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,100
 We don't even have to really nitpick it we can dive right into this video. This is the claim

188
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,820
 This is the claim that's being made first off before I get into the claim

189
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,180
 Let's talk about the evidence because that's really important, right?

190
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,500
 You've got to find out the evidence the first piece of evidence this guy presents to us is a

191
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,660
 commercial for a car and guess what the model of the cars

192
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:55,940
 The Porsche 9/11 Porsche 9/11 car so and it travels in time in the commercial, right?

193
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,940
 They see if the guy gets in an old version of a Porsche and drives and he goes through a time portal

194
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,180
 Then it's the brand new Porsche and the commercial says time travel might always remain a dream, but we're working on it

195
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,580
 Porsche 9/11

196
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,700
 Time travel ergo

197
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,100
 9/11 represented time travel forget the Porsche forget the Porsche part

198
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,500
 I'm surprised it didn't try like adding up the each number of each letter and adds up and then you divide it by six and then

199
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,120
 Add 16 and it would keep doing stuff until it reaches 9/11

200
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,360
 But anyways forget the Porsche part you got to forget that part and just focus on the number 9/11

201
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,100
 And then that tagline and here's this other piece of evidence when the plane hits the building it disappears

202
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,420
 Right we all saw that the I mean obviously logically it did disappear it disappeared into the building

203
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,560
 It's like when a plane hits a it's not a cartoon Bugs Bunny wasn't flying it

204
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,700
 It didn't hit the building crumple up and then fall to the ground like yes

205
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,520
 Yes, you're right in a sense the plane disappeared from view because it

206
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,040
 smashed into a building going full speed

207
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,860
 But to him it just simply ceased to exist ceased to exist right so do you have any proof of that?

208
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,180
 Well before he gets into that before he gets into where the plane went or if it did really disappear

209
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,820
 You start talking about back to the future so we did an episode

210
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,740
 I don't know maybe a month or two back about did back to the future predict 9/11 and

211
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,460
 It was a fun episode. I enjoyed it

212
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,940
 But the answer is no

213
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:34,260
 Did it but this guy starts citing that video and starts saying did you know did you know that?

214
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,260
 Back to future predicted 9/11 and but see he goes in a different route with it luckily because I didn't want to just do a

215
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,740
 Repeat of that he goes in different things

216
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,060
 He says the car in back to the future has to go 88 miles an hour

217
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,300
 so remember that number 88 miles an hour has to go 88 miles an hour and

218
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:59,060
 Doc not Doc Martin talk brown at the end of the first one when everyone piles in the car

219
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,980
 He goes where we're going we don't need any roads

220
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:11,380
 Car takes off like an airplane and in the first movie when the car crashes into a barn when he first goes when Marnie McFly first

221
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,620
 Goes back in time crashes into a barn farmer comes down goes it looks like some sort of airplane and

222
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,220
 The YouTube dude the guy's making this video goes no it doesn't and

223
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,940
 Then he moves on to the next point

224
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,500
 But he's trying to say that the car is an airplane and people think it looks like an airplane

225
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,140
 But it's not an airplane but in the end it actually flies like an airplane and the only vehicle that doesn't need roads is an airplane

226
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,420
 I mean forget boats or hydrofoils or any other like blimps the only thing that needs doesn't need a road is an airplane and

227
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:50,500
 88 88 miles an hour 88 is the key to his conspiracy theory

228
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,020
 For some reason he gets stuck on the number 88 and the rest of his video is talking about the number 88 now

229
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,380
 We get into the weird stuff because the idea of people of the planes disappearing have we've heard about before

230
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,740
 We've heard it dude and trust me it's going to get really bizarre

231
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,580
 We've heard we've heard about the planes disappearing before that was an early conspiracy theory that the planes are just holograms

232
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,380
 Because they simply just smashed into the building and just seemed to disappear remember again disappeared from view is different than

233
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,280
 Disappearing it's baby logic if one of your friends gets up and leaves the room you don't go oh no my friend disappeared

234
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
 I can't see him anymore, and then they come back and you go

235
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:39,380
 But some people don't understand that so when they see something smash into a wall and it disappears from view it's disappeared

236
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,780
 It doesn't exist anymore. So anyways, that's not a new theory the planes just disappeared

237
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,980
 9/11 being predicted by back to my head

238
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,580
 I'm just leaning against my hand at this point 9/11 being predicted by back to the future is not a new theory either

239
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,980
 But this is this is okay. Let's get into this now

240
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,940
 I'm gonna have to shred it to pieces before we put it back together

241
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,400
 He goes on to connect Donald Trump and this isn't gonna get political so don't reach for the off button now

242
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,980
 Donald Trump was connected to the time travel experiment again. He never really says what happened

243
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,420
 He just believes the planes went in time. He never even makes a statement if they went in the past or they went into the future

244
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,360
 He just says time travel was involved. It's super super vague conspiracy theory. He says

245
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,220
 Donald Trump we've covered this as well Donald Trump is all these connections to time travel his uncle

246
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:37,340
 Took all of Tesla's designs and he gave Donald Trump time travel machine and the story of Baron Trump

247
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,220
 We covered that on Donald Trump as a time traveler. That was our Thanksgiving episode

248
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,020
 You can listen to that one if you'd like to as well

249
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,260
 I think that's a good episode as well

250
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:50,900
 But but he had ties Trump into 9/11 time travel in two other ways in this YouTube video

251
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,460
 About 9/11 time travel the person who I didn't write down the dude's name

252
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,620
 So his name is defeating the Sun

253
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,900
 The YouTube video you actually be able to check out it's in the show notes and all that stuff

254
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 But defeating the Sun says

255
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,580
 This okay says this

256
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,260
 If so, I just took away two minutes to go look up his name and it was a breath of fresh air and have to concentrate on this nonsense

257
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:23,780
 So Donald Trump's quote regarding 9/11 he plays this audio clip of Donald Trump and what happened was Donald Trump had called up a

258
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,140
 local

259
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,220
 New station on the morning 9/11 as the all of the chaos is going on and he's talking

260
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,260
 He's doing an interview with these guys and this is what he says

261
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,780
 If you know anything and he's there they asked him specifically about how the buildings were built and stuff like that because he's a

262
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,780
 Real estate developer so he would know have a basic knowledge of

263
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,780
 So this is what he said if you and I gotta read a verbatim here

264
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,380
 If you know anything about structure

265
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,540
 It was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside

266
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,860
 The reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows you have this steel on the outside

267
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,420
 So you have this steel on the outside of the building

268
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,420
 That's why when I first looked and you had big heavy I beams when I first looked at it

269
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,760
 I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel and this is steel

270
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,900
 That was you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center folks

271
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,660
 I think you know if you were ever up there they were quite narrow and in between was this heavy steel

272
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,940
 I said how could a plane even a plane even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been how could it possibly go through this steel?

273
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,140
 so

274
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,300
 What defeating the Sun is saying and what Donald Trump is saying is that the reason why the windows were?

275
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,060
 Narrow on the World Trade Center was because they're all of the steel of the building was on the outside normally

276
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,140
 There's more steel columns in the middle and when they built this World Trade Center buildings

277
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,420
 They wanted to be super sturdy

278
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,500
 They are trying a new thing where they're putting it all on the outside basically creating an armor system

279
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,020
 And he said the reason why the windows were so narrow up there as opposed to other

280
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,940
 Complexes in New York or even around the world because they had all that steel

281
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,380
 They didn't have a lot of room for the windows and basically what he's saying is that from what he understands

282
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,460
 He doesn't understand how a plane could go through that heavy of steel

283
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,020
 And that's the end of the quote on defeating the Sun's topic now

284
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,660
 I did have to go and research that a little more just to make sure I understood the context

285
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,260
 We'll get to that in a second because again

286
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,780
 Yes, Donald Trump didn't talk about that on 9/11 and he said I don't understand how a plane could go through these steel reinforced building

287
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,300
 But doesn't call him a 9/11 truth. He was not saying that Donald Trump says that 9/11 was an inside job

288
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,300
 Doesn't say that Donald Trump says that it was control demolition nothing like that

289
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,940
 He's based Donald Trump's basically making the statement. I don't understand how it could have happened and and somehow

290
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,960
 That means Donald Trump has something to do with the time travel experiment

291
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,180
 So remember that remember that Donald Trump says he doesn't think a plane can fly through a building and somehow that

292
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:58,340
 Implicates him in 9/11 just like everyone who looked up and said oh my god. How how can this destruction be possible?

293
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,100
 Are we all implicated in this but that's not where

294
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,940
 I'm saving the death blow

295
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:09,500
 Defeating the Sun has the best info for last he puts up this little picture of stuff, right?

296
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,420
 He puts up this little infographic and it's all this list of information and he says I'm not gonna read it out to you

297
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,920
 But you can pause the video and read it yourself

298
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,740
 Which is hilarious to me because it makes me think that even he knows it's nonsense

299
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,400
 It's definitely nonsense enough that he didn't want to waste his time reading it

300
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,700
 Unfortunately, I had to and this ties it all together with a nice little bow remember 88

301
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,220
 Remember you have to go 88 miles an hour to go in time in

302
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,420
 Back to the future now the planes weren't going 88 miles an hour. They are going way over that

303
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,220
 None of the planes were united 88 there weren't you know

304
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,840
 If you added up the ages of everyone and divided by 12 it everyone didn't add up to 88 no he ties 88 into

305
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,500
 Donald Trump and nothing to do with time travel

306
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,580
 Nothing to do with time travel

307
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,400
 So somehow back to the future the car goes 88 because they knew that 88 was Donald Trump's favorite number

308
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,700
 So here we go. This is the list of proof that we have Donald Trump's favorite number is 88

309
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,760
 Trump spent 88 million dollars on his election. It's not true. He spent 65 million dollars

310
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
 I had a look all this nonsense up

311
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,700
 Trump had 88 events or campaign stops during his campaign not true. He had 323 stops

312
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,380
 Flat out lying to us at this point disinfographic

313
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,540
 Trump's cousin Thomas P. Trump died one year before Trump's inauguration 88 days before he turned 88 flat out not true

314
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,380
 Trump doesn't have a cousin named Thomas P. Trump

315
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:43,440
 It was a meme that went around that somebody let wrote and thought it would be funny didn't exist the guy never existed

316
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
 He said that 88

317
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,580
 appears at every Trump rally on his podium and I

318
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:57,720
 Couldn't verify that but I'll tell you right now. I know for a fact that's not true because 88 is gang code for a hail

319
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,180
 Hitler and a lot of people know that and if Trump had 88 on his podium at every single rally he held

320
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,940
 That would be huge news

321
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:13,160
 That is not you this guy may think that 88 means back to the future time travel

322
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,000
 But to anyone who's ever spent any amount of time on the street knows

323
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,480
 88 if you see a guy wearing a jersey that says 88 on it do not assume he's a back to the future fan

324
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,820
 So if Donald Trump is walking around with 88 on his podium

325
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,840
 That would have been the the biggest controversy of the election

326
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,880
 It's not a you can't be like I'm a big back to the future fan. My elections going 88 miles an hour

327
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,900
 also

328
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:48,120
 14 I mean like people there's no way he would be able to get away with putting coded messages like that that are even

329
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,320
 vaguely close to game symbols at all

330
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,900
 Anyways, where was it going? Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. So he wraps it up with this

331
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:05,420
 Actually, no he wrapped it up then then the official video he goes. Oh, yeah, Donald Trump time traveler uncle Tesla all that stuff

332
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,180
 Bear and Trump all those stuff. He wraps it up video ends and you're thinking that that's dumb like

333
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:18,500
 It's funny because the conspiracy theory I think I almost feel like I want to give this guy helping hand

334
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:25,540
 I'm not going to I almost feel like I could help him like partner with this dude to give him some tips on how to craft a

335
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,660
 Good conspiracy theory and I've covered that multiple times

336
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,340
 He's he has a good angle the coming up with the idea of the buildings

337
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,580
 The plane's not crashing in the building, but the planes going back in time is an interesting sci-fi

338
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,060
 Idea and you could from his video right now if it gets a little bit of traction

339
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,620
 He'll probably get one two thousand people to actually believe in it and a lot of people will watch it just to laugh at him

340
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:52,940
 But we can tweak it so we can say that yes the planes did go into the bit the planes did time travel and

341
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,060
 The reason why we only have the one camera angle

342
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,800
 I'm actually riffing I haven't thought of any of this through in my head yet

343
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,640
 But the reason why we have the one camera angle of the first plane attacking is because those guys knew the attack was coming

344
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,840
 Which which is actually a conspiracy theory already because those guys were Israeli and that that kind of connects it to the massage

345
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,940
 But anyways in this new made-up conspiracy theory off the top of my head those guys were time travelers

346
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:24,680
 Who were on the second plane that traveled into the past the second plane hits the building goes back into the past

347
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,400
 They get off of it and they wanted footage of the first plane so they could create some sort of loop of footage because this is some sort of

348
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,480
 Illuminati

349
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:40,000
 Mine game they need to show both planes going in but what happened was the first plane goes into the building and

350
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,520
 Travels back in time and the second plane goes into the building and goes forward in time

351
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,080
 And we find out in the course of this conspiracy theory that everyone on the first plane was also

352
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,960
 Everyone on the second plane except for the two people on the ground they decided not to continue their journey

353
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,960
 So the first plane goes into the building and a time portal opens up and it goes back in time and

354
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,120
 They go and they live their lives like normal

355
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,640
 But now they know that they have to go forward in time for the circle to be complete for the Illuminati nonsense

356
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,240
 No, let's forget the Illuminati nonsense first plane was a test all these people were basically

357
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,600
 Had no future so they were paid like they're like here. We're gonna give a bunch of money to your families and stuff like that

358
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,840
 Okay, now that's even getting a little more unwieldy. Let's go back to basics

359
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,520
 the first plane actually was hijacked by Al-Qaeda and

360
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,920
 Instead of crashing in the building went into the past and and oh dude

361
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,520
 Here's and then what happened was in in their timeline

362
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,560
 Everyone realized that the World Trade Center had a time portal in it and it became this huge dystopian future because

363
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,360
 Countries were fighting over the portal so the plane that went back into the past had to plant bombs in the World Trade Centers

364
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,400
 To bring them down and that way it would cover for the fact that there were time portals there

365
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,840
 So it was a control demolition. It was totally controlled. I'm actually I don't believe in any of this

366
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,200
 But you understand like that is how to create the theory and that was 100% off the top of my head

367
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's how you do it. You can have time travel airplanes and stuff like that the theory that I just came up with off the top of

368
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,600
 Head and you there was those parts where I was kind of stopping and having to discard elements is

369
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,920
 100% more cohesive than anything this dude put out like his video is absolute nonsense

370
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:35,040
 It just jumped there's no theme going through it and he again never really states was it a time travel experiment

371
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,600
 Was it on purpose? Was it an accident? Where are the planes now?

372
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,600
 My made-up theory at least accounts for a lot of questions

373
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,840
 Why the planes just there wasn't a lot of wreckage of the planes and the buildings coming down because they went back in time

374
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,960
 And then have to hide the existence time portal time portals are still up there, but now they're in the middle of nowhere

375
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,240
 So it's it's less likely that some guys are gonna be working in this office and go to the bathroom and then end up in

376
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,560
 1884 a witch is chopping them up now just the the portals are there

377
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,280
 Oh and those lights where they had that giant light shoot up in the air

378
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:16,040
 That was basically trying to deactivate no no no that was trying to send a message to the time travelers that the mission was successful

379
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,000
 Wait a second

380
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,120
 This is a horrible theory because that means the people who went back in time

381
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,000
 Planted those bombs and killed everyone in the world right I forgot about all the people who died in the World Trade Center

382
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,400
 But but but all that being said

383
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,160
 That is a more cohesive that conspiracy theory if someone put it out there

384
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,480
 I predict if I was an unscrupulous person

385
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,760
 I could just make a YouTube channel with nonsense like that and I'd get 10,000 subscribers

386
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,480
 Overnight maybe not overnight

387
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,640
 But if in a far shorter period than this channel does a lot of people don't like debunking stuff

388
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,920
 And I'm glad you guys do stick around and listen to the show. I'm glad you guys enjoy the show

389
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,520
 But I mean really like I'm competing with a lot of people who put this nonsense out much bigger channels than mine

390
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,200
 And it's just I'm not I'm not bitter or anything. It's just a different lane

391
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,600
 I've quoted this statement before some guy says you never get rich writing books saying UFOs don't exist

392
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,400
 So I mean, you know, I'm not a skeptical

393
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,640
 I'm more skeptical on conspiracy theories than I am on paranormal events like UFOs or aliens and ghosts and stuff like that

394
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,800
 But conspiracy theories are just they're almost always built on quicksand. That's your second quicksand reference for the day

395
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,560
 But I'm gonna read you to what rest of this Donald Trump quote

396
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,360
 I was shocked when I heard this quote now again

397
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,640
 I went to find out what the context was of this because I first heard this

398
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,160
 Donald Trump quote on this weirdos YouTube video and I thought where's this coming from?

399
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:49,680
 So I had to go find and I did I and it's in the link. It's in the show notes. I found I can't believe this isn't more popular

400
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
 I found the

401
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,720
 Interview he was doing with radio station the morning of

402
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,880
 9/11 and he does say the whole quote and then folks

403
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,280
 I think you know if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow and in between there was this heavy steel

404
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:11,240
 I said how could a plane even a plane even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been how could it possibly go through this steel?

405
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,840
 next sentence I

406
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,320
 Happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously

407
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,500
 Because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall

408
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,240
 Was Donald Trump a 9/11 truth there and nobody knew about it

409
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,440
 That was a weird quote to accidentally stumble across I

410
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,600
 I

411
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:44,160
 Was shocked that he didn't include this part on his YouTube video. I'm actually shocked that nobody as far as I know has ever

412
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,120
 found this I

413
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,520
 Think this might be a dead rabbit radio exclusive as far as like conspiracy stuff goes I

414
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:59,640
 Don't know about today, but at some point it sounds like Donald Trump was a 9/11 truth or the world is so

415
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,400
 weird and

416
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,920
 It took an idiot's YouTube video to expose the truth

417
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,400
 Hats off to you defeating the Sun

418
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,960
 It wasn't the truth you wanted us to hear

419
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,320
 But it might have been the one we needed to
