1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 What would you do if you were a referee at a soccer match and a demon showed up to play ball?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at one of the more bizarre and honestly more unbelievable stories that I have personally experienced.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,800
 Because today, I'm going to tell you about the time I went to hell.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,300
 I'm a rock big gal.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,300
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having lots of fun doing whatever you're doing.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,300
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,300
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,300
 Give it up everyone on your feet for Daniel's Kuchineskies.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,300
 Wooo everyone give a big round of applause. He's kind of giving me a thumbs up.

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
 That was a pretty close pronunciation I think.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,300
 Daniel's Kuchineskies. He actually sent me a link.

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,300
 He sent me a link for a website that told me how to pronounce his name.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,300
 I really appreciate that.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
 Daniels, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,300
 You guys can't support the Patreon. I totally get it. Trust me. I totally get it.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,300
 Just help spread the word about the show. That helps out so much.

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
 By letting people know about the show, you help the show grow.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,300
 Daniels, let's go ahead and I'm going to give you the hair hang glider.

22
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,300
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,300
 And we are going to glide all the way out to South Africa.

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,300
 Specifically we're headed to Durban, South Africa.

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 And we're there to watch a soccer match between the Orlando Pirates.

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
 They're a football club out of Johannesburg.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
 And they're playing against the Amazulu team.

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,300
 This is home field for them. They are actually the Durban team.

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,300
 So they have all these guys getting ready for soccer. I don't know.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,300
 How do you do that? Juggling balls, practicing their kicking, maybe running laps.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,300
 Jason, all that stuff would make them super exhausted.

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,300
 They're about to run back and forth playing soccer.

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,300
 Maybe they just, I don't know, lounge there and eat spaghetti for the carbs.

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,300
 But whatever they are doing, they are doing right now.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,300
 They're getting ready to play this soccer game.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,300
 These two teams are ready to rumble. It is time to start the game.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
 So the referee comes out and he blows his whistle.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,300
 And all the players are on their field.

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,300
 They're all cramped. They're like, "Oh, why are we running all those laps right before the game?"

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,300
 "This is going to be totally sucky." And I don't know anything.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,300
 I can't tell. I don't know if I'm giving you any hints.

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,300
 I don't know anything about soccer. But apparently, apparently,

43
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,300
 one of the things they do before they start the game

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,300
 is the referee counts the players on each side.

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,300
 So he looks over at the Orlando Pirates.

46
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
 And you imagine that would be super chaotic, right?

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,300
 Because they're still running around, still moving and doing drills and things like that.

48
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,300
 I don't know. I guess I'm going to research a little bit more.

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,300
 But the referee counts the Orlando Pirates.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

51
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
 Quit moving. Quit moving.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
 Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

53
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,300
 Okay, eleven Orlando Pirates are on this side.

54
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
 And then he turns to the Amazulu team.

55
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,300
 He's kind of like two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,300
 You're not supposed to have twelve people on your team.

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
 Don't these guys know how to play soccer?

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,300
 These are professional teams, too. This is like a little league, right?

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
 They have twelve players on their team.

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,300
 The referee goes, "You got to get rid of... You guys got too many players."

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 And the Amazulu team is kind of looking around,

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
 and they have no idea what this referee is talking about.

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
 They clearly only have eleven people on the field.

64
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,300
 And the referee starts to get kind of upset because he's like,

65
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300
 "I know how to count, and I'm counting to a twelve."

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
 You guys there, you do do do...

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
 And he goes, "Look, that's the twelve guy. Look at the goal.

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,300
 Look at the goal over there. There's two goalies.

69
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,300
 You can't have two goalies."

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,300
 And everyone looks over, even the Orlando Pirates,

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
 they're trying to figure out what's going on at this point.

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
 Everyone's on the field, they look over.

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,300
 There's one goalie standing there.

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
 And they're like, "Ref, we don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
 It's one goalie. It's the goalie that we always have."

76
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
 And the referee starts walking over there, and he goes,

77
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
 "Well, who's this, then?"

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
 And he points at a dwarf.

79
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,300
 There's a dwarf on the field standing next to the goal.

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
 He's looking over the referee, and he goes,

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,300
 "You get out of here. You're a twelfth player.

82
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
 I don't think you're... I don't think you're not even wearing a jersey.

83
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
 What are you doing here?"

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,300
 This story was actually told to us by a member of the Orlando Pirates

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
 who was here this day.

86
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,300
 His name is Innocent Mayo Oyo.

87
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
 Innocent Mayo Oyo.

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
 Legendary soccer player in South Africa.

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
 He's telling this story, and he goes,

90
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,300
 "We're standing on the field, and this referee is yelling at a patch of grass."

91
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
 "Get out of here, dude. You're not on the team."

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 "You can't have... This is like your mascot or something,

93
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
 but he can't be on the field."

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,300
 And Innocent goes, "We're watching this,

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,300
 and he's yelling at this patch of grass."

96
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
 We figured out what was going on.

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
 Wasn't that the referee had lost his mind?

98
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:43,300
 The referee was in an argument with a Tokoloshi.

99
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,300
 A Tokoloshi? We did an episode on this guy a long time ago.

100
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,300
 These things are absolutely terrifying.

101
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
 It may be the size of a dwarf,

102
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,300
 but that's where all of the connection to, like, helpful fairy lore ends.

103
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 These guys are serial... These creatures are serial killers.

104
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,300
 The episode we did was about a guy who wanted to become a powerful shaman,

105
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,300
 and to do that, he made a deal with the Tokoloshi

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,300
 to just walk around the countryside murdering people.

107
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,300
 And it's... That was a true crime story.

108
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
 That wasn't a fable.

109
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 That was a true crime story.

110
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
 He blamed it on the Tokoloshi when he finally got caught,

111
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,300
 and when they executed him, people were worried that this guy had become so corrupted

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
 by being around a Tokoloshi and doing its bidding

113
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,300
 that he may now become a Tokoloshi himself.

114
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
 These things are to be feared.

115
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
 At the very least, they are a mischievous, elf-like creature,

116
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,300
 but, you know, pull pranks, pulling down people's pants and stuff like that,

117
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
 putting sugar in your gas tank.

118
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,300
 They also, though, like, are also known for just straight-out murdering people,

119
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,300
 or convincing other people to do the murdering for them.

120
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
 Very, very vicious creatures.

121
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
 But there's a couple caveats, and I don't remember coming across this detail

122
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,300
 in the original episode, but they can be controlled by other people.

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 The Tokoloshi can actually... You can make a bargain with it like a genie.

124
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
 So the fact that it was on the playing field, and it was working goal...

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
 It was gonna work the goalie net with the Amazulu goalie,

126
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
 it's possible that one of the players had summoned this creature.

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,300
 It's also possible that these players were completely ignorant to what was going on.

128
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,300
 They were shocked. They were wondering why this referee was yelling at Apache Grass as well,

129
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,300
 and that someone, maybe, who had bet on the Amazulu team to beat the Orlando Pirates,

130
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
 summoned the Tokoloshi to show up there to help fix the game.

131
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
 But what's interesting, so we have this mythological creature,

132
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
 how come only the referee can see it?

133
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,300
 Now, I don't remember coming across this detail in my Tokoloshi episode,

134
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,300
 but this is a long time ago. It was like a good 6-700 episodes ago, I think.

135
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
 The Tokoloshi can turn invisible if it swallows a stone or if it drinks water.

136
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
 That's within its power base. It can become invisible.

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 But apparently, this is what Innocent was saying when he was doing this interview.

138
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,300
 He was being interviewed for about his career in sports,

139
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
 and this interview was in the SouthAfrican.com.

140
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
 This was a legitimate newspaper that published this article.

141
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,300
 He said, "Yeah, it was really weird. This referee was yelling at this Apache Grass,

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,300
 and he was saying there was this tiny guy working the goal and none of us could see him,

143
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 and Innocent goes, 'We realized it was a Tokoloshi.'

144
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
 And the only-- I don't remember this detail, this is fascinating--

145
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,300
 the only reason why the ref could see it and we couldn't?

146
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:43,300
 Because when that invisibility spell is enacted, it only works against black people.

147
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,300
 And the referee-- I didn't say this-- you're like, "Okay, okay, keep going."

148
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,300
 The referee was white. You're like, "Oh, okay, now that makes sense."

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,300
 The referee was white, and the players on both teams, they were all black.

150
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,300
 So the spell worked against them. This thing was completely invisible to them,

151
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,300
 but to the white referee, he could clearly see a dwarf on the field.

152
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
 And the dwarf refused to leave.

153
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
 And the referee's yelling, and at this point, I think people are like,

154
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,300
 "Oh, dude, there might be one of these invisible Tokoloshi creatures here,

155
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 and that's why he's seeing this because he's white and the spell doesn't work against white people."

156
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
 And the result of this thing, the referee ended the game.

157
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
 Technically, the game didn't even start yet, but the referee said,

158
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,300
 "Games canceled. This player will not leave the field."

159
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,300
 And everyone was like, "What in the world is going on? There is no other player."

160
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 But it turns out that it was a Tokoloshi. According to Innocent, that story is actually true.

161
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,300
 Now, I wasn't able to go and look through the statistics of the teams

162
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,300
 and find out when they met up. There's no date to this story.

163
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
 So it could just be a funny story he's telling, right?

164
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
 But fascinating, right? Fascinating.

165
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
 There's so many ways you can go with it.

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,300
 One, I do like the idea of someone not on the team summoning this extra goalie,

167
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:10,300
 but someone who has bet against the Orlando Pirates using black magic to fix the game.

168
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,300
 We did an episode a long time ago, it's baseball and esoteric ritual.

169
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

170
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 And I think there is something to be said for people trying...

171
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,300
 So much money is riding on these games, right?

172
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,300
 That I think you could easily find people who are...

173
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,300
 People use lucky charms, people use lucky traditions to try to fix games.

174
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
 Are people actually using black magic to fix these games?

175
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
 Are they summoning demons?

176
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
 So they win a bet?

177
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,300
 Is this more commonplace than we know?

178
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,300
 Are people actually using black magic to influence sporting events?

179
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,300
 And I think the answer, without doing any research, just off the top of my head...

180
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 Yeah, of course! Of course!

181
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,300
 People have lucky superstitions, or I gotta have my special underwear on before I watch the 49ers play,

182
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
 da-da-da-da-da, all that stuff, right?

183
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 So we're already casting these superstitions, using these spells, these rituals,

184
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
 you have to do the same thing to get ready, get your team to win.

185
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,300
 Why not take the extra step and invoke dark spirits?

186
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,300
 But then also the idea of a creature, a cryptid, a demon, whatever it is,

187
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,300
 whose abilities only affect one ethnic group.

188
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,300
 And that opens up a whole other door of question.

189
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 Maybe there is a subset of humans that only they can see Bigfoot.

190
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,300
 They have a genetic makeup in them that only they can see Bigfoot,

191
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
 and then there's other people who can only sense Bigfoot,

192
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 and then there are people who they could be five feet away from Bigfoot, would never know it,

193
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 because they just can't perceive it, and it's a genetic thing.

194
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
 Who know? I mean, it's fascinating.

195
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,300
 I can't recall a time we've come across that before.

196
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,300
 A cryptid that only appears to people of a certain ethnic group.

197
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 Now, the Togoloshi can appear in full, but once it casts its invisibility spell,

198
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,300
 it only works against black people? That's mind-boggling.

199
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,300
 Then it might explain why we have regional cryptids.

200
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,300
 We have cryptids that are really only spotted in certain areas.

201
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,300
 I think the idea has been, I've always just considered,

202
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 that region is most suitable for its habitat,

203
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 just like how you don't have Bengal tigers in downtown Milwaukee.

204
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
 It's because they're suited to be in the jungle.

205
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,300
 They're not walking around swamps. They're not walking around frigid mountains.

206
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
 You know what I'm saying? Like a black bear, you figure it's in the woods,

207
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,300
 not in the desert. That's where it evolved to exist.

208
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,300
 And so when you'd have cryptids, when you had something like Bigfoot,

209
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 only in the Pacific Northwest, then you have a version like the Yeti,

210
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 high up in the mountains. That was the area where these creatures were.

211
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,300
 No. What if that's because the people of certain genetic makeups,

212
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
 they're the only ones who can see those cryptids?

213
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,300
 Fascinating, fascinating theory. And I've never heard of this before.

214
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,300
 And also just an interesting story. You're trying to play soccer, a monster shows up.

215
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
 What do you do? You can't keep the game going. They didn't even start the game,

216
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 but you can't even start the game. Is it fair if one side has a serial killer dwarf

217
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,300
 who has black magic abilities, right? That's just full on not fair.

218
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,300
 And the ref just called the game. You would imagine though that people like other referees,

219
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,300
 I'm sure that guy got fired, right? I doubt he was able to keep his job.

220
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,300
 And he was like, no boss, believe me, there was a dwarf there that no,

221
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,300
 no one else saw and it argued with me and I had to cancel the game because he wanted to leave.

222
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,300
 And they're just like, you're fired. And he's like, I'll show you.

223
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 He goes and he summons the Tokaloshi. Who do you want me to murder?

224
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,300
 Crazy, crazy story. I'll see if we can find more stuff like that.

225
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,300
 Yeah, what if there's just the only people who actually can see aliens or have encounters with aliens

226
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,300
 are genetically predisposed to that. Insane to even think about that.

227
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,300
 But while we are mind boggled about that, Daniels, let's go ahead and toss you the key

228
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,300
 to the carbonar copter. We're leaving behind Durban, South Africa.

229
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 We're headed all the way out to Orangevale, California.

230
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,300
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

231
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:32,300
 This story I'm about to tell you, I've only told one person this story and I just told it to him two days ago.

232
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,300
 And the only reason I told them this story, it was my friends Sabine,

233
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 the only reason I told her this story was in preparation for telling you this story.

234
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 I have not repeated this story. I've told no one this story for 10 years.

235
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,300
 Not because it's weird, and it is.

236
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 Not because it's unbelievable, and it is.

237
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,300
 Not because it's super, not because it's super disgusting, and it is all of those things.

238
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,300
 The reason why I don't tell this story, I've had a lot of paranormal encounters happen to me.

239
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 I've encountered demons, I've encountered ghosts, I've encountered shadowmen, all sorts of phenomenon throughout my life.

240
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,300
 And I don't have any problem telling those stories. Why haven't I told this story for 10 years?

241
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 Because there's a difference between all of those stories and the story I'm about to tell you.

242
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:34,300
 And I'm going to be upfront about it so you can take this story with a grain of salt.

243
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:41,300
 I believe something, something happened, but the story I'm about to tell you

244
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:54,300
 is really the only paranormal story that I have where I was high when it happened.

245
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,300
 I started smoking in 1999. I was 21 years old.

246
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 And I smoked and I drank heavily. I really drank on the weekends, but from 21 to 25, I smoked weed, I partied, I was still awake and baked.

247
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:16,300
 And I woke up stoned and I would drink on the weekends and I partied hard for about 4 years and I turned 25 and said, "I don't want to do this anymore."

248
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 I just gave it up. Gave up drinking, gave up smoking.

249
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,300
 From that point, from basically 25 till now, I drink maybe 2 or 3 times a year.

250
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:35,300
 I'll drink on New Year's Eve, after I was done doing a play here in Hood River, like after we did a show, a show wrapped, I would drink.

251
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,300
 That's about it, right? Went from partying hard to giving it all up.

252
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,300
 And I don't smoke weed anymore, but I did start smoking weed again in my mid-30s.

253
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 So I was about 35, 36 years old and I had no job at the time.

254
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,300
 No one was hiring. This was during the Great Recession. I was in California. There was nobody hiring.

255
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,300
 I didn't have a job. I was living on my grandma's house and I was stoned. I was stoned every day.

256
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 It was so awesome, right? It was totally dope.

257
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,300
 I'm living on my grandma's house. Her refrigerator was always full of the yummiest foods and she always had packed 12 packs of soda.

258
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,300
 It was like unlimited amount of 12 packs of sodas in the other fridge, in the garage.

259
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,300
 It was me and my pit bull, Molly. I had this pit bull mix, Molly.

260
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,300
 And I slept in the backyard of my grandma's house. I had a recliner.

261
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:36,300
 Sacramento is really one of the few cities you can do this in. Well, I'm sure there's lots of cities, but I would be...

262
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,300
 This is how I spent every day. I'd have this recliner that I had in the backyard of my grandma's house.

263
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,300
 And Molly would be sitting next to me and I'd be on the computer and I'd be reading about conspiracy theories,

264
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,300
 reading about UFOs, reading about all this stuff until like 4 in the morning each night.

265
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:00,300
 It was just such a... I mean, like the coldest it ever got was like 74. You put on a sweater.

266
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,300
 And I'd just sit out there and the sun would set and it'd be out in the night and I'd just be smoking.

267
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:10,300
 Smoking weed and researching conspiracy theories. I did that for probably about two years in my grandma's house.

268
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 It was great. I loved it.

269
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 So I smoked heavily 21 to 25 and then I began smoking pretty heavily again, 34, 35 up to 36.

270
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,300
 And you go, "Jason, that's fine. You know, a lot of people smoke, right?"

271
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 So you're about to tell us a paranormal story that happened while you were high.

272
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,300
 Okay. But let me... I still don't think I've given you the scope of my highness.

273
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 I didn't like the pipe. You know, the little weed pipe they have. I never really liked the bong, too much work.

274
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,300
 I was such a lazy stoner. I was like, "Ugh, I gotta fill something with water. Ugh."

275
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 I didn't use a glass pipe. I didn't use any sort of pipe.

276
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:05,300
 So the way that I smoked my weed was I would take a Coca-Cola can and I would turn that into a pipe.

277
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:13,300
 And if you know anything about the human body and about just chemistry in general,

278
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 what I'm describing to you is the way that I smoked my weed for pretty much two years, my friends.

279
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,300
 I'd always be like, "Dude, dude, you should use my pipe. It hits way better."

280
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 And they'd go, "Jason, the reason why you're getting more high now is because you're smoking paint, dude.

281
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
 You're actually breathing in aluminum."

282
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 They're like, "I've had friends go, 'I will buy you a pipe, dude. Please. Please, you're gonna give yourself early onset Alzheimer's.'

283
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 What? No way, man. I would smoke out of a soda can."

284
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 So you would punch a little hole, you would crumple the can up and punch little holes in it,

285
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,300
 and you'd put the bud on the little holes, like a little gate there, and then you would shh.

286
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 You would hold the... You guys were like, "Yes, Jason. I've seen crack addicts smoke before."

287
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,300
 I know exactly what you're describing. As you're holding the flame over the noug, you're breathing it in.

288
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 It hits better than a pipe.

289
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:15,300
 Now, is it because of the airflow and there's more smoke allowed to build up in this soda can versus a little pipe?

290
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:22,300
 Maybe that's why? Is it because I was possibly inhaling aluminum dust and paint? Maybe.

291
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:31,300
 But the point is, when I got high, I was in the stratosphere.

292
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:39,300
 I would get so stoned that every time I smoked using this method and I smoked multiple times a day for two years,

293
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:48,300
 I always felt, "Oh, dude, I... Uh-oh. I'm stoned forever now. Like, I'll never be normal after this."

294
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,300
 An hour later, I'm hitting it again. Oh, dude, what? Oh, man.

295
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,300
 But I smoked like that all the time. Again, my friends were gonna have an intervention for me.

296
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,300
 They'll offer to buy me pipes. They go, "This is dumb. Quit doing this."

297
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:13,300
 And the reason why I'm setting all of that up, because the story I'm about to tell you is, yes, it's super unbelievable.

298
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 But I smoked like this constantly, constantly, constantly, and I never had an experience like this before or afterwards.

299
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 And that's why, to me, this story may have happened.

300
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 But again, grain of salt. I wanted to be completely upfront with you guys.

301
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,300
 This is the only paranormal story I have where I'm stoned, and I wanted to be completely upfront with you guys.

302
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,300
 So you guys go, "Whoa. Jason suffered brain damage that day. Here's the story."

303
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 Absolutely. I've never told this story to the general public, and again, I never repeated the story until like two days ago.

304
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,300
 To get at least one person's view on it.

305
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:03,300
 I'm sitting there in my grandma's backyard. Beautiful, giant molly is next to me.

306
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:12,300
 And my grandma had like this brick planner, that not planner, like a day planner, planter, you know, that you put flowers and stuff.

307
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 She had like this brick, little brick seating area that kind of wrapped around her house.

308
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,300
 And then we had like a table in the backyard with some lawn furniture and stuff like that.

309
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,300
 And I love, I love my grandma's house. They've passed away now and the house is in another person's hand and it looks beautiful.

310
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 So I'm glad that another family is experiencing this beautiful piece of land.

311
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,300
 But at the time I'm sitting in the backyard of my grandma's house, I'm sitting on the brick planter.

312
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,300
 So I'm facing the lawn furniture.

313
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 And I sit there and I put the can to my mouth.

314
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,300
 And I flick that brick and get that flame coming out of that lighter.

315
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:52,300
 [smoke hissing]

316
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:01,300
 And as that smoke is rushing in to my lungs, I'm dropped into hell.

317
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 And when I say dropped in, this is where all of the weirdness begins.

318
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:14,300
 When I say dropped into hell, what happened was I remember feeling myself physically beat.

319
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:25,300
 It was almost as if a metal claw from a machine picked me up because the next thing I know, I actually fell maybe three inches into a chair.

320
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
 There was this empty chair and it wasn't like I slid there.

321
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
 It wasn't like I poofed there.

322
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:38,300
 I have a clear sensation of falling three inches into the chair.

323
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,300
 And I'm sitting in this chair thrown type of thing.

324
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,300
 You know, it's a high back chair and it had like the high arm rests.

325
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 And I'm sitting in front of a long black oval table.

326
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,300
 It's almost like I'm at, you know how you have like those long conference tables.

327
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,300
 I'm at one of this table and it's this long black shiny table.

328
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,300
 And on each side of me, there are two chairs.

329
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300
 So I'm sitting at the end of the table and now going lengthwise down the table.

330
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:26,300
 There's two chairs and then at the head of the table, the opposite end of the table, there is another chair and in all of these chairs are sitting demons.

331
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,300
 Now what's so interesting about this again?

332
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,300
 Was it because I was getting super high smoking out of aluminum can?

333
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
 Yes, right?

334
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 There could definitely be the cause of all this.

335
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,300
 But what I thought was so weird about this is they were not demons how I had envisioned them.

336
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
 They didn't look like comic demons.

337
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,300
 They didn't look like cartoon demons, anything like that.

338
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:58,300
 They didn't even look like the demons you learn about in medieval texts where they're like this demon has like the eagle head and the spider body.

339
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
 And where's the kind?

340
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
 It wasn't like that.

341
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
 It wasn't how I would envision a demon.

342
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 It wasn't the biblical depiction of a demon.

343
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,300
 It wasn't the medieval depiction of a demon.

344
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,300
 There were five humanoids sitting at this table.

345
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,300
 And the only way I could describe them is they were all about the size of a human.

346
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,300
 They were all probably around my height to a little bit over six feet tall.

347
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,300
 They weren't immensely tall or short.

348
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,300
 Their skin was tight on their bones and they had a lot of protusions.

349
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 Their bones would come off in weird angles.

350
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
 It was symmetrical though.

351
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,300
 So if you if one of them had the one sitting at the end of the table was the one that had the closest look at.

352
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:52,300
 I remember that his skin was very tight against his bones, his shoulders, his shoulders kind of popped out farther than the.

353
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
 God, so hard to describe.

354
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 So hard to describe an indescribable demon.

355
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,300
 It looked like this bony structure that someone had tightly put this flesh on it.

356
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:10,300
 Its face was very angular and wide and its skin was aquamarine.

357
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 And then there were two more of these creatures sitting on one side of me and sitting on the other side of me.

358
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 And I realized instinctively, just like the story we covered yesterday,

359
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,300
 I realized instinctively I was in hell.

360
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 I'm sitting in this chair and there's demons on the side of the table.

361
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:37,300
 There's a demon in front of me and the table's probably like a little over six feet long, maybe more like 10 feet long.

362
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 Behind the demon sitting at the head of the table, there was like a, not necessarily a window, but an entrance to a balcony.

363
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:57,300
 Because I could look past him and I saw an archway and then I saw where the balcony was and where it ended and outside the balcony.

364
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 I'm looking past now the balcony.

365
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:10,300
 All I can see is a massive red geological structure, some sort of huge wall that was a dark yet light red.

366
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 The building I was in was, again, very ornate, very archway specific.

367
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,300
 I remember seeing these overhangs.

368
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:30,300
 You could see the ceiling and the wall and they had just kind of these intricate designs hanging down, very symmetrical again, but not necessary.

369
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
 Like this place, I'm sure this place was up to code.

370
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,300
 All of the archways were decorative.

371
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 Sitting in this chair at this table full of demons.

372
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 And I realized, "Oh, dude, I'm in hell."

373
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 What was weird, I had no fear there.

374
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
 I'm just sitting there.

375
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:58,300
 And the head demon looks at me and he's opening his mouth to say something.

376
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 And then the demon sitting to my right, the demon sitting closest to my right.

377
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 His, he again had a very angular type of body.

378
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
 A lot of bone protrusions, really tight skin.

379
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:27,300
 But as this head demon's about to say something to me, I look over at this guy, this demon to my right, and his lower jaw to his neck begins to inflate.

380
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:33,300
 It now, from his chin to about the middle of his chest, he now looks like a bullfrog.

381
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 He just has this giant, "Boo!"

382
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 He's like, "His skin is ballooning up."

383
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:46,300
 And now his face from the nose down takes these very frog-like features.

384
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:52,300
 And I look over at him and he's just staring straight ahead.

385
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 And his face goes, "Boo!"

386
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,300
 And then he goes, "Boooo!"

387
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,300
 And he vomits all over the table in front of me.

388
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,300
 The vomit was this really, really thin liquid.

389
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
 It wasn't chunky, it wasn't Campbell's soup.

390
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 I'm gonna name all the foods you're eating right now, all the foods you have in your refrigerator.

391
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
 It wasn't Campbell's soup, it wasn't Pizza Rolls, thickness.

392
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:29,300
 It was just this really thin slime that came out, all this bile that came out of him, was this thin slime.

393
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,300
 But that's not what I was concerned about.

394
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
 I would have been concerned just by that.

395
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:42,300
 But when he throws up, out comes all of this thin slime, this thin bile.

396
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 And also about, I didn't count, so I'm gonna estimate, but probably about 8 to 10 dicks and bowls.

397
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:08,300
 He vomited up a bunch of penises and testicles, and they began flooding the table.

398
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,300
 They were all, this is so weird, right? This is so weird.

399
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,300
 And even in the moment, even when I was sitting there, I was like, "Ugh!"

400
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
 They were all around the same shape and size.

401
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 There were none that were comically large or comically small.

402
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 They're all around the same size, they were all attached, not to each other.

403
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,300
 That would have been like the beholder from D&D.

404
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,300
 You'd have a penis, and then the balls were attached to the penis still.

405
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
 They were clearly severed off there.

406
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:46,300
 And these balls and dicks are now kind of flowing through the bile on the table.

407
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,300
 And then they're stopping, there's just the momentum, the momentum that was carrying them.

408
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:57,300
 And actually, not a thing about me, maybe it was 6 to 8, maybe 8 to 10 is a little too much.

409
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
 But he throws up all of these dicks and bowls on the table.

410
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,300
 I'm looking at these things, and I look up at the head demon.

411
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,300
 And now it's my turn to say something, right?

412
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:15,300
 I look at this guy, throw these dicks and bowls, I look at the dicks and bowls, I look at the head demon.

413
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,300
 And I remember this all so clearly, and this happened 10 years ago.

414
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,300
 I remember making a motion with my hand, like you're about to talk to someone.

415
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 And I was about to say, "What in the world? What is going on here?"

416
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 That was so disgusting to me.

417
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,300
 The fact that I was in hell, the fact that I was at a table with these demons,

418
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,300
 I turned to the head demon and I remember making a motion with my hand like I'm about to ask,

419
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
 "What in the world is going on?"

420
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:49,300
 And then the next thing I know, I'm sitting back in my grandma's backyard in a different chair.

421
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 I'm now sitting in one of the lawn chairs, staring out into the crystal blue Sacramento sky.

422
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,300
 Now if that was the first time I ever got stone smoking out of a soda can,

423
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
 I would have completely disregarded the story.

424
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,300
 It's just, this is what happens when you smoke aluminum.

425
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 But I'd been doing this for years.

426
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,300
 I feel like Jason knows that makes it more likely, dude.

427
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
 Brain damage is cumulative.

428
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
 Here's the thing too, and I keep saying I was smoking aluminum.

429
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,300
 I do want to be clear, because actually there will be links in the show notes about the harmful effects.

430
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
 I'm not recommending doing this, but I was smoking the bud.

431
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,300
 They said it's actually really, really hard to get the metal hot enough to smoke the paint and the aluminum.

432
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
 I was smoking the bud.

433
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,300
 I'm not, again, I'm not saying that it was saved by any means.

434
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,300
 But if that was the first time I had smoked, I had that experience.

435
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 Or if it was the last time, like that, I did that, and I never smoked again because of that experience.

436
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 I would say it was smoking out of the can that caused that, but I smoked long before that,

437
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,300
 and I continued to use the can way after that.

438
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,300
 Never, ever, ever, ever had an experience like that before.

439
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,300
 There was one time where I ate a bunch of weed.

440
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,300
 I was taking spoonfuls of BAMR, which is just cheap brown weed.

441
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,300
 I ate like 40, $50 worth of this cheap weed.

442
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,300
 And Bud Bundy crawled out of the television set when I was watching "Mary with Children."

443
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:29,300
 So I did, I have hallucinated before, but I've never had an experience where I was teleported to another place

444
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,300
 where I'm moving around in this situation.

445
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
 Never.

446
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
 And never since, either, because I did continue to smoke after that.

447
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
 I don't smoke anymore.

448
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,300
 But you can understand why I never told that story, right?

449
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,300
 And it's the same thing when I'm reading stuff online and when it starts off with me and my buddy,

450
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,300
 who were really stoned that night, I just really disregard anything that comes after that.

451
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,300
 And that's why I wanted to be upfront with you guys as well.

452
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,300
 I didn't want to say at the ending, "Oh, by the way, by the way, I was smoking weed off a soda can."

453
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
 I wanted to be very upfront about this.

454
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
 This is the only paranormal story I have while I'm high.

455
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:13,300
 What's super interesting is, this was a story I was really never going to tell anybody.

456
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,300
 One of the real reasons why I wanted to share that story with you today

457
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:26,300
 is because on yesterday's episode, we covered a story about a young man who believes that he went to hell.

458
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
 Now, it happened right before he went to sleep.

459
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
 Is it possible it was a dream?

460
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
 Sure.

461
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
 Is it possible that my experience...

462
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:40,300
 Skeptically speaking, and even I believe that a strong part of that experience was how I was smoking weed

463
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
 and the fact that I was smoking weed.

464
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
 I'll be totally honest with you.

465
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,300
 But yesterday, when I read that, there's always been a part of my mind thinking,

466
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
 "Well, maybe that was real. Maybe that was real."

467
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,300
 Yesterday, I did an episode about a guy who went to hell, and there's similarities between the stories,

468
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
 which I thought was really weird.

469
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,300
 He wasn't a can-smoking drug user, but he said,

470
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,300
 "He appeared in a coliseum where there were these three demons there,

471
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:16,300
 and he felt like this conversation, this situation had been going on before he got there,

472
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,300
 and his consciousness was simply dropped in to it, that his physical body was already there,

473
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,300
 and he is now joining the proceedings."

474
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,300
 And when I read that, I go, "That's kind of how it felt for me. I didn't really know how to say it.

475
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,300
 I didn't really understand that part of the situation, but yeah.

476
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,300
 I felt like whatever was going on there, they weren't perturbed that I was there.

477
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:47,300
 I was supposed to be there. My subconscious was now joining a form there."

478
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,300
 That really kind of made me relic in my experience and go, "Maybe something did happen."

479
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,300
 You know, the young man yesterday, he's super disturbed by it.

480
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,300
 He doesn't know if he ever escaped from hell.

481
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
 For all he knows, he's still trapped in there.

482
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:07,300
 It's interesting because I didn't get the implication, I didn't get the feeling that I was trapped in hell,

483
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,300
 or I was sentenced to hell. I feel like, you know what, I can't even tell you.

484
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,300
 I don't know why I was there, but I didn't feel like I was trapped there, or I was being punished, or anything like that.

485
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:25,300
 I was there for some reason, but I, who knows why, right?

486
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,300
 I almost said something and I go, "Jason, you don't really think that. That's not true.

487
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,300
 You could go conspiracy cap all you want, but at the end of the day, you don't know why you were there.

488
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,300
 You didn't feel like you were in trouble. You didn't think you were sentenced to hell, but you were there,

489
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,300
 and that demon was about to tell you something, and then the other dude threw up a bunch of dicks and balls.

490
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,300
 I remember being so repulsed by that.

491
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:55,300
 And I remember in the moment when I'm in hell, and as I'm traveling back to earth,

492
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:02,300
 and even though it's a split second, I remember it is nothing's really a split second.

493
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,300
 When it happens there is time. It's just too short for us to really measure.

494
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:19,300
 I remember as I'm in the moment and as I'm moving back into reality, how disgusted I was at the nature of that thing.

495
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:28,300
 Like it completely repulsed me. It was a very, very visceral reaction.

496
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:33,300
 I was disgusted by something that could just eat human genitalia.

497
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,300
 But yeah, that's it. That's it. It's a story that I don't tell because I was super stoned

498
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:47,300
 and that obviously makes it most likely the reason why it happened was because I was super stoned.

499
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:58,300
 To me it's interesting because I think even if it is drug induced, did the drugs allow me to push through some sort of space time thing?

500
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,300
 No Jason, you're smoking paint! You're smoking paint! That's what was going on. I don't know.

501
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,300
 I love the story. I'm actually glad I could share it with you guys.

502
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:21,300
 Really this shows to me is a level of comfort with you guys. If I told this story earlier in the run of the show, what are we listening to?

503
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,300
 But I think after so many episodes I know you guys are just great. You guys are a great audience.

504
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:46,300
 And you guys know what to expect and that's really to expect the unexpected. And I've never told the story publicly until a couple days ago and other than one person you now know the story about the time that I smoked weed off a soda can and went to hell.

505
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:58,300
 And came back after a guy vomited up human genitalia about a foot away from me. It's weird and unbelievable and disgusting.

506
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:13,300
 But whether or not it was caused by drugs or paint or I actually for a moment was in hell, I know something happened that day.

507
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:21,300
 I don't know what caused it, but the memories are real. The experience was real.

508
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:29,300
 I just don't know what caused it and I don't know what it means.
