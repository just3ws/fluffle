1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Here's a sentence I thought I would never ever say.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,560
 Is Post Malone Haunted by a Jewish Ghost?

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,920
 And then the worst massacre in American history you've never heard of.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
 Today on Dead Ravorating.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:26,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravorating.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,800
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,480
 This is the second draft of this episode.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
 I had some previous stories.

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,760
 You know the hardest thing about this podcast, and it's a lot of fun.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,840
 But sometimes I'll record an episode and I'll listen back to it right when I'm done recording

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
 it.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,360
 In this case, I go, "That episode sucked."

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,000
 That episode that I just recorded, I couldn't, I wouldn't want to listen to if I was a fan.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,120
 I try to record all this stuff for 15 year old Jason.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,560
 Whenever I'm creating stuff when I was a musician, I wrote all my music for 15 year old Jason.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,760
 This podcast I put out for 15 year old Jason.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,920
 And I was like, "Yeah, 15 year old Jason wouldn't like that."

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
 So I'm doing a new one.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,880
 And basically all of that research and stuff, gone.

22
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,440
 But this one I like.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,560
 This one I do like.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
 This one has some really interesting stories in it.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,040
 I didn't want to salvage something though from that old story from that last episode

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,760
 that I think 15 year old Jason would enjoy.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,360
 So I used to work at a Wells Fargo Call Center.

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
 And we would have potlucks every once in a while.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,120
 And usually when people do potlucks or when people like bring food, I usually don't bring

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 anything.

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,520
 I'm usually, I usually do one of two things.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,720
 I don't bring anything.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 Or I bring something gross so nobody asks me to bring anything the next time.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,440
 Like once I had a potluck, I think it was at Best Buy and they put me in charge of bringing

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
 the drinks.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,360
 So I went and got that gross watered down Sunny D. like Tampiaca or whatever it is.

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,320
 It's like a Hispanic brand.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,120
 Because I didn't want to do potlucks.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
 I'll eat the food.

40
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't want to bring stuff.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
 So they put me in charge of drinks.

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:16,920
 So I bought a couple of these giant gallon jugs for like 97 cents each of that watered

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,440
 down Sunny D.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,440
 I'm not above ruining things to not have to do things in the future.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,880
 So anyways, and it actually wasn't that bad.

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
 The drinks weren't that bad.

47
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,040
 But it's not what they were expecting.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,840
 But then I remember that we were having a potluck and I was in good mood.

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
 You know, I was, you know, like, hey, you know, I was like happy.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,640
 So I decided to go along with the plan.

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,280
 And people were saying, you know, we're going to have a taco bar and people were saying,

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,560
 I'll bring the cheese and I'll bring the taco shells.

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,800
 And I said, you know what, I will bring the meat.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,040
 I'll be the person who shells out the most money and I'll bring all the meat.

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
 I'll bring a ton of meat.

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
 And I was like, oh, okay, cool.

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
 You know, because it's kind of out of character.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,160
 So anyways, I went to the store, bought like five, six pounds of meat, tons of meat.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,480
 And I was like, oh, this is awesome.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,280
 Like I'm contributing to a potluck for the first time in my life.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,320
 And I'm like, 28 years old.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,400
 So I get the meat.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,040
 And the next day I go into work and I bring it into the break room and it's taco time.

64
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
 We're ready to make the tacos.

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 Everyone's starving.

66
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
 Everyone wants a taco.

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,720
 I walk in and my friend Santiago looks at me as I'm carrying it in and he goes, what's

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 that?

69
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,360
 And I go, it's the meat.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,840
 And he looks at me and goes, you're supposed to cook it.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,960
 You're supposed to cook the meat at home and put seasoning in it.

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:51,360
 I brought, I brought in five pounds of frozen, I brought in five pounds of frozen ground beef.

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,680
 And I go, I thought we'd cook it here.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,040
 And he looks around and goes, with what?

75
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,960
 There's nothing here to cook five pounds of meat with.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,120
 There's nothing here to cook a patty with.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 There's no stove.

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
 There's no oven.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,880
 There's no George Warman grill.

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,240
 How are you going to cook?

81
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,560
 Now, I had worked at this place for probably like two or three years at this point.

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,240
 I just didn't think.

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,840
 And here's the interesting thing about this.

84
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,600
 Did you know that you can go to a Taco Bell?

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,000
 We may have had like a, someone may have known someone there, but we, we were in the same

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,720
 parking lot as a Taco Bell.

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,200
 You can go to Taco Bell and buy bags of Taco Bell meat.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 And it looks disgusting.

89
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,400
 It's just like this huge, giant like sealed bag full of like that brown clumpy meat.

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
 But someone went over there and bought like three or four bags for like 20 bucks.

91
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
 And it's quite a lot of meat.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,720
 And that was how the Taco Bar was saved from Jason.

93
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,600
 I took my meat home and had hamburger patties forever.

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
 I told that story the end of the last episode because I did a long segment on suicide and

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,640
 young kids killing themselves and all these horrible statistics.

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,840
 And then the episode just kind of faltered out.

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,520
 And I go, I got it ended with a story.

98
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 That was the story.

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,600
 It's really the only thing I think I'm going to salvage from that.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
 But anyways, I thought that was a funny story.

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
 I hope you did too.

102
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,880
 And I hope you've learned a valuable lesson.

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,640
 Do not invite me to a potluck.

104
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,680
 People who know me and this, I know people who know me listen to this podcast, they're

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,400
 going to realize all the times people said, Hey, bring, bring snacks to the player, bring

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,600
 snack and they'll be like, Damn it, Jason, that's why you never bring anything.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,840
 So many times.

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,960
 Okay, let's get started with the episode.

109
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,720
 That was a long, that was a long little story, but Post Malone is a, I don't know if rapper

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
 is the right term, but Post Malone is a musician.

111
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 He's not my cup of tea.

112
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
 I like rap.

113
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
 I like older rap.

114
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,840
 I like 89, 88 to like 2003.

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,920
 That's my thing of rap and rap's the thing I'm most grumpy old man about.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,200
 Like, Oh, those kids, you can't hear them nowadays.

117
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,960
 I think that came across in my episodes about XXX tentation.

118
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,200
 I don't like new rap.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
 Post Malone's more of like a Drake, where he sings a bit, but anyway, so he's actually

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,160
 very, very successful musician and he seems to have a, be a fan of the paranormal.

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,360
 He's been on the show ghost adventurers.

122
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,640
 I listened to some of his music while I was prepping this episode and I was just like,

123
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,160
 eh, you know, he's not my cup of tea, but I, as I was listening to it, I was like, I

124
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,400
 can understand why people enjoy this music.

125
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
 It's just not for me.

126
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,160
 Anyway, so quick recap in the past, maybe month and a half, he's had a spate of bad

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
 luck.

128
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,040
 He was on his private jet and the plane takes off and the landing gear tire malfunctions.

129
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,720
 I believe it blows out or something like that.

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,280
 And the planes like, uh, oh, like we kind of need that to, you know, land and not blow

131
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
 up.

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
 So plane circles a bit and then lands, I believe at that same airport.

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,960
 And you know, the fans are like, Oh my God.

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,520
 And Post Malone's like, listen, you know, thanks for your prayers.

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
 I'm fine.

136
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
 It was scary.

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,080
 And then a couple weeks later, maybe a week or two later, he gets in a car accident and

138
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,720
 people are like, well, that's a weird coincidence.

139
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,800
 And he's like, yeah, I'm a little shaken up, but you know, I'm okay.

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,560
 And then a couple weeks after that, some armed gunman broke into a house he used to live

141
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,440
 at and they stole a bunch of money and they were looking for him.

142
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,820
 Apparently there were people there.

143
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,080
 That story's still a little like shaky.

144
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,520
 Like I'm having a hard time finding a ton of detail on that.

145
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,440
 He's armed gunman go into a house where he used to live and they robbed the place.

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,600
 So at this point, people are wondering, is something going on with Post Malone?

147
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,480
 I actually read because I read that celebrity gossip stuff.

148
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:40,920
 The first thing I saw was that Post Malone had slept with a girl, but the girl's grandfather

149
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,480
 was like the head of some cartel in South America and he took her virginity, which,

150
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
 you know, you're a musician.

151
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,640
 That's kind of par for the course, but his, the granddaughter's grandfather was the head

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,560
 of some South American cartel and he was trying to kill Post Malone.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,480
 And I thought, well, that could explain the home invasion, but how do you blow a tire

154
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 off of a plane?

155
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
 I mean, there's more efficient ways.

156
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,360
 Just blow the plane up or just shoot him in the middle of a day.

157
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,600
 I mean, he's a rapper.

158
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,400
 People assume that they're going to get shot.

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
 So I read that and I was like, oh, that's interesting.

160
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,520
 And then a couple days later, I read this news article and it's kind of been flowing

161
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 around the internet.

162
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,840
 So like I said, Post Malone's interested in the paranormal and he's been on that show

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
 Ghost Adventures.

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,280
 Well, the host of Ghost Adventures has a museum dedicated to weird and spooky stuff and he

165
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,960
 has the Divock box.

166
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,680
 This Zach Baggins, he's the guy from Ghost Adventures.

167
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,960
 He has the Divock box.

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 What's the Divock box?

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
 You ask?

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
 It's a cursed wine cabinet.

171
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,720
 This was sold on eBay quite a few years back.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,000
 So the history of the Divock box, it's a wine cabinet and I'm going to give you a brief

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 history.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,640
 It's a wine cabinet that contained like a couple pennies and a couple locks of hair and like

175
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,720
 a little note that said Shalom.

176
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,280
 And it came over from Poland, you know, around the time of the Holocaust, this Jewish woman,

177
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,520
 it's a, it's a, because a Jewish spirit, this Jewish woman takes it when she flees, she

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,680
 takes the box, she didn't want to leave it there.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
 But she's like, don't ever open it.

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
 Apparently it's haunted.

181
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,480
 It's actually what it came to attention because a guy bought it and he was immediately like,

182
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,520
 all the bulbs started going out in my house.

183
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,480
 I had this strong smell of cat urine.

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,400
 I don't have a cat.

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,360
 He sells it on eBay and he goes, this box is haunted.

186
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,480
 Like I gave it to my mom the day I gave it to her.

187
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,160
 She had a stroke and when I was talking to her in the hospital, she wrote a note.

188
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,200
 She couldn't speak, but she wrote a note and said, hate gift.

189
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
 And so at this point, he's had enough weird stuff.

190
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,760
 He sells it on eBay and other person who bought it on eBay starts to experience weird stuff.

191
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,040
 Where we're at now is that the Divock box was then bought by a guy and then he gave it to

192
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,720
 the, the host of Ghost Adventures.

193
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,720
 And there's a video of the host of Ghost Adventures opening the box and Post Malone, who was

194
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,360
 on that episode, touches the guy's shoulder, Zack's shoulder, and then they both leave

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
 the room.

196
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,320
 And after all this battle, like Zack goes, I think he's being haunted by the ghost.

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,720
 I think he's got this ghost on him.

198
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,120
 Oh, and the Divock is a ghost from Jewish folklore.

199
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,360
 Is it possible that Post Malone is being haunted by a ghost?

200
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 That's causing all this stuff.

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
 I mean, I guess it's possible.

202
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 So here's the thing.

203
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
 I believe in ghosts.

204
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,840
 I don't believe every ghost story ever, but I do believe in ghosts.

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,040
 I do believe in cursed objects and items and things like that.

206
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,280
 I believe in demons and so on and so forth.

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,360
 Again, I have my skeptic side of it.

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,480
 When I was researching this, I was approaching it from a skeptic side and I think I'm kind

209
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,000
 of meeting in the middle one.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,080
 These events actually have happened to Post Malone.

211
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,600
 Luckily, he's safe, I hope.

212
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,400
 No ill will on him.

213
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,520
 I hope he continues to be successful and happy and all of that.

214
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,640
 Be possible that this ghost is causing this stuff.

215
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
 Yeah, I guess.

216
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,280
 Could it just be a series of three really random events happening to somebody that's

217
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
 in the public eye?

218
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,080
 Yeah, absolutely.

219
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,440
 But imagine, let's assume, let's table this skepticism for a moment.

220
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,520
 If this box has this Divock in it and it's this efficient, don't you think the government

221
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
 would get involved?

222
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,360
 Don't you think it wouldn't be passed around from collector to collector?

223
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
 If there was an object, see, and that's the thing, when I say I believe in cursed objects

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,160
 and stuff like that, I think they either reside in one of two places or three places.

225
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
 One, they're undiscovered somewhere.

226
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,560
 Two, they're being passed around unknowingly from person to person or three, they're in

227
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,640
 somebody's very, very secure hands.

228
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,120
 Because if this Divock box was able to be opened and an evil spirit would come out and

229
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
 mess with you, if I was a South American cartel, I'd buy that.

230
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,000
 If I was the US government, I'd get that because it'd be the ultimate weapon.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,320
 I think that, I mean, imagine if the US government has a laboratory where they take all of these

232
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,240
 weird items, they see the story online, you have people just researching this stuff all

233
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,520
 the time and they, nothing, you know, they read in all this creepypasta, no big deal.

234
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,480
 But once they're like, oh no, this box actually, we can account for these diseases and these

235
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,400
 strokes and these accidents.

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,040
 The US government would take it because it's a weapon at that point.

237
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,440
 It's an uncontained nuclear bomb.

238
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,920
 I wouldn't be shocked if at some point there's a, there's storehouses of this stuff.

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,240
 I know there was that show warehouse 13 on Sci-Fi Channel, I never watched it, but you

240
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
 know what I mean?

241
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,200
 Like governments or assassins or like high level people have, they're like, yeah, look

242
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,560
 at this is this amulet.

243
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,320
 If you wear it, you die within three days.

244
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
 There's only one in the world.

245
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,640
 People would be like, what are you talking about, dude?

246
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,760
 Are you, what are you talking about?

247
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
 You want to put it on?

248
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,960
 No, I don't want to put it on.

249
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,520
 You just told me I'd die in three days.

250
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
 Yeah, but you don't believe it, right?

251
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,680
 Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, they would contain this stuff, not for a good reason, not to

252
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,360
 be like, we have to keep these safe.

253
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,100
 No, it would be like, we need to figure out if can we mass produce this box?

254
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,880
 Can we ship one of these box over to Iran and give it to Amola?

255
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
 So I don't know.

256
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
 I mean, I, again, I think cursed items are real.

257
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,920
 I don't necessarily know that the Dibbock box is real.

258
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,600
 The stories sound real, but again, right now they're just kind of stories that you see

259
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 online and stuff like that.

260
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,320
 The owners are said, no, this stuff's happened to me and I'm not going to go to that dude

261
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,040
 and be like, dude, prove to me your mom had a stroke.

262
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,440
 I want to know the truth.

263
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
 I mean, that's pretty douchey.

264
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,200
 But if I had a ton of money, I'd buy it and then try to figure out how to reproduce it

265
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
 or how to use it to take somebody out.

266
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 Somebody that I didn't like.

267
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 Here you go.

268
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,520
 I'm not going to say her name, but here you go.

269
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
 Open this up.

270
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 That's cold-hearted.

271
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 I should have made that joke.

272
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,840
 Okay, so we're going to move on to our next story.

273
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,960
 Speaking of being cold-hearted, we are going to talk about a son of a bitch.

274
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,520
 There's really no other way to describe this guy.

275
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,920
 We're going to go back in time.

276
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,520
 Not literally, but that would be awesome.

277
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:05,280
 It's a man named Andrew Kehoe and he was just a despicable, despicable human.

278
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,520
 People said that he was eager to do favors and he kind of helped out.

279
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,080
 This is in Michigan, I should say.

280
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,120
 They figured, you know, people, he said he was a good guy, but he was like, get really

281
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,640
 angry really quickly.

282
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,160
 He didn't have an easy life.

283
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,600
 He had a daughter who had some serious health problems.

284
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,240
 He had a stepmom who blew up.

285
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,800
 She was working on the stove and there was a fire.

286
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,920
 There was an accident and she just gets covered in hot grease and fire and he threw water

287
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,440
 on her, which just made the grease fire even more and it just killed her.

288
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,960
 So he had to watch that.

289
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,960
 And then he came where there was this school council in the area.

290
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,120
 This is a small town.

291
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,680
 So this is in the town of, this is Bath Township.

292
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
 And it was this small area.

293
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,520
 And he was just, he was one of those guys that was kind of luckless and then he'd get

294
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,440
 a break and then things would kind of fall apart for him.

295
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,320
 I don't feel sympathetic for this guy because he's a total scumbag, but yeah.

296
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,640
 And so just so you don't feel too sympathetic for him, he was super impatient.

297
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,680
 One day a neighbor's dog walked onto his property and it was barking.

298
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,280
 So he shot it.

299
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,080
 Another time he beat a horse to death.

300
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,280
 So again, like this guy is pretty scummy.

301
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,960
 He would run for local elections.

302
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,040
 He'd win.

303
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,040
 He ran for, so he was put in the position of temporary town clerk and then he ran to

304
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,440
 take the position over for full and he lost and he became despondent and he stopped working

305
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 his farm.

306
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,360
 And his neighbor was like, I've seen that before.

307
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,560
 I've seen people stop working their farm and generally means they're going to kill themselves

308
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,080
 because the farm is your life.

309
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,920
 If you're not working your farm, if you're not preparing it for the next season, you're

310
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,440
 not planning on having the next season.

311
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
 That's his buildup.

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:59,880
 So now we're in 1927 and on May 18th his house blows up.

313
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
 And Andrew's sitting there in his car.

314
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,600
 He's getting everything ready to go somewhere as rescuers are showing up and they're kind

315
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,480
 of putting the fire out and stuff like that.

316
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,000
 And Andrew turns to the rescuers and he says, boys, you're my friends.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
 You better get out of here.

318
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,600
 You better head down to the school and drives away.

319
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,840
 As the rescuers are kind of like, what the hell?

320
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,280
 And they're putting out, still putting out fire.

321
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,800
 They hear a second bigger explosion at the school.

322
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,720
 Now Bath Consolidated School was an elementary school and what Andrew Kehoe had done over

323
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,760
 the course of months, he had been purchasing dynamite.

324
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,960
 He was putting someone in his house and putting hundreds of pounds in the vents at the school.

325
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,400
 They had a timer set to go off at 8.45.

326
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,520
 The north side of the school just is vaporized.

327
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,720
 The ceiling just collapses.

328
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,120
 The kids who don't get incinerated in the blast get crushed by the debris.

329
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,280
 People said that, you know, people just begin rushing out of their houses.

330
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,040
 The people at the farm who were putting out that fire, they immediately got all their

331
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,200
 gear back on their trucks, started headed to the school.

332
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,360
 People just began removing rubble.

333
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,880
 Teachers were saying, you know, I was just seeing bits and pieces of kids.

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,720
 The one teacher who survived the explosion, she said she just saw people, kids flying

335
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 across the room.

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,320
 Like they had been catapulted, just an unimaginable horror.

337
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,800
 And the first thing she was like in shock from the noise, and then she sees this horrific

338
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 stuff.

339
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 People started pouring out of their houses.

340
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,960
 They don't know what's going on.

341
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,360
 They began removing debris.

342
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,720
 One account said that they saw women pick up pieces of debris that would take 10 men to

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 move.

344
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,320
 And you just had, you know, people were moving debris, people were looking for their children.

345
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,760
 They were just hoping under each piece they would find somebody alive.

346
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,080
 Andrew Kehoe pulls up outside of the school and he's sitting there in his truck, kind

347
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
 of slumped over.

348
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,640
 And the school superintendent walks over to the truck to, you know, he thinks that Andrew

349
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 had been injured as well, because he's just kind of slumped over.

350
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,840
 So the superintendent, another local and a young boy who had survived the blast of the

351
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,080
 school, he kind of wanders over by the truck as well.

352
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,800
 The superintendent looks on the truck and he sees Andrew has a rifle.

353
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,880
 And there's a brief struggle over the rifle.

354
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,360
 And then the truck explodes.

355
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,480
 Andrew shot some more explosives in the truck that he had filled with bits and pieces of

356
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 metal.

357
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,720
 He created a giant car bomb, you know, a giant IED that just shot out Trapnell.

358
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 Killed himself.

359
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
 Killed the superintendent, the farmer.

360
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,040
 Killed the young eight-year-old boy who was just standing there.

361
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 And a witness of the scene saw that this gets gross.

362
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,120
 So I don't mind if you guys turn it off, but or this gets dire, I guess I should say that

363
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
 he goes there.

364
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,040
 He goes, there's one witness that I saw a mother sitting there.

365
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
 This one here.

366
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,480
 So this one witness, this was his account.

367
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,420
 I saw one mother, Mrs. Eugene Hart, sitting on the bank a short distance from the school

368
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,400
 with a little dead girl on each side of her and holding a little boy, Percy, who died

369
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
 a short time after they got him to the hospital.

370
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,920
 This was about the time Kehoe blew his car up in the street, severely wounding Perry,

371
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,600
 the oldest child of Mr. and Mrs. Hart.

372
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
 So she's sitting there holding her son, who's dying.

373
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,560
 Her older son is next to her.

374
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,940
 And he just gets shredded by this debris.

375
00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:01,500
 In total, his wife died, Andrew died, and then 44 other people died in that explosion.

376
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,060
 Now the north side of the school blew up.

377
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,380
 As investigators were going through the area and people were removing Rebel, they found

378
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:19,220
 500 additional pounds of dynamite on the south side of the school, wired to a clock set to

379
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,920
 go off at 8.45.

380
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,320
 What they think was the first explosion sent shockwaves and disabled the other trigger,

381
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
 sparing all the kids on the south side.

382
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,040
 I mean, obviously there's debris flying around and there are injuries, but I think over 70

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,880
 people got injured or something like that.

384
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,480
 I mean, obviously, you know, they are injured by debris.

385
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,680
 There was a total of 58 non-fatal injuries that day.

386
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,320
 And he was just mad insane.

387
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,860
 This on record is being the worst school massacre in American history.

388
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,060
 When we talk about school shootings, which are equally tragic, and you see numbers like

389
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,740
 13 or 24 or things like that, none of them have even come close to comparing to the Bath

390
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,700
 School Massacre.

391
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,540
 And hopefully none of them ever will.

392
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,060
 Hopefully none of them ever will.

393
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,340
 It's just been lost to history.

394
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,900
 It was this massive news story back then obviously.

395
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,140
 It was coast to coast news.

396
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,740
 It's actually worldwide news.

397
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
 They covered it.

398
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,480
 I think it's fascinating because these huge life changing events, these huge events that

399
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,360
 ripple throughout the globe just become lost as time goes on.

400
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,800
 So yeah, that's the story of the Bath School Massacre.

401
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,300
 It's chilling.

402
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,680
 It's just chilling to think that he planned this out and actually took steps like he's

403
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,600
 planned it out for months and then he like prepared it for months.

404
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,200
 He was hiding dynamite in there and the whole time he wasn't having second thoughts.

405
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,620
 He was totally going to do this to punish the town that he felt slighted him in the election.

406
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,580
 They figured the election was the ultimate trigger, him losing that election.

407
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
 Nuts.

408
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,260
 Nutty stuff, people.

409
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,740
 Nutty, there's crazy people in the world and it's up to good people to stop bad people.

410
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,860
 That's just kind of the mission, really.

411
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,020
 That's our mission is to reach out to these people who are being sucked into the darkness

412
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,180
 and say you're not alone.

413
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,580
 That might sound pat, but it can help.

414
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,200
 It really can help.
