1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 A hitchhiker is picked up and then forced to dig a grave.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,120
 You too can own a piece of the Betts sphere, the mysterious object we recovered in our

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,920
 last episode, and then we look at the topic of Operation High Jump.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,400
 It's on the conspiracy iceberg, but near the top.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,920
 Fairly well-known conspiracy.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,240
 Did the Nazis really collaborate with aliens to build a fleet of UFOs in Antarctica?

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,520
 And did they beat back an expeditionary force sent to destroy them?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,840
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, or I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,520
 I hope you're having a great day too.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,680
 Sorry about yesterday, I just had to take the day off.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,240
 I feel better now, I'm not 100%, but I definitely feel better now.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,480
 I do have to say I am very impressed and humbled by the outpouring of support I got.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 I appreciate that.

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,880
 I got a lot of emails, a lot of YouTube comments, a lot of stuff on my Facebook Messenger, wishing

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,960
 me a well-rest, hoping I get better soon.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
 I'm glad that you guys all appreciated that.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
 I just need a little bit of break.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,360
 I actually had one listener, Shakira Shakira, offered to do an invitation of me and to still

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,560
 have a podcast that day.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,120
 And I was intrigued just to hear somebody imitate me.

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,000
 He said he could, again I'm assuming it's a he, I don't know why I do that, but that

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,400
 he could match my cadence and style and anything else could be chalked up to mic differences.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,640
 Or no, no, no, anything else chalked up to the fact that I was sick.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,520
 So my voice may sound different.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,280
 And then he had some mic issues and he said it wouldn't sound good, but I appreciate that.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
 I thought that was a great offer.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,320
 I still want to hear that though.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,560
 You've already said it, so now you gotta do some sort of audio clip for us.

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,760
 I guess I probably do have a pretty easily imitated cadence.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
 And I actually edited it up.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,400
 It's funny because when I'm recording the podcast, I take a lot more pauses in between

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 words and when I edit it, I cut out like a half second in those long pauses or a second

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,240
 just to kind of speed stuff up to keep it into that 30 minutes.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,480
 But again guys, I really appreciate that you listened to the show and I really appreciate

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
 that you care about me and that's really awesome.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
 It was quite amazing.

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,120
 Okay, but we're gonna go ahead and jump into this.

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,920
 And that is, because we've got these three great stories, one of them, the first one

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,360
 is "New News."

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,880
 And so I couldn't find the link for it.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,800
 I couldn't find the link for it.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,320
 This story was kind of a small story in the middle of nowhere, so I apologize for that,

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,600
 but I thought it was an interesting enough story to cover.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,840
 We're in the year 2004, that magical year of wacky news.

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,320
 We're in the region of Harare, Zimbabwe.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,480
 There's a bunch of hitchhikers walking down the street.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 The 20 of them.

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,360
 And I guess they were probably looking for work in another town, but it's the middle

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 of night.

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,120
 These 20 hitchhikers are walking down the street or road.

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
 They're in the middle of nowhere.

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,040
 And this truck pulls up, this big truck pulls up and they're like, "Hey, you guys need

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
 a ride?"

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 They all said it once.

58
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
 And I don't know how they fit 20 people into the truck, but I guess if you were determined,

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
 you can do anything.

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,320
 So you get 20 people into this truck.

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,880
 Let's assume it's like a big military style truck.

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,480
 Maybe the people who picked them up saw the hitchhikers depart and they got the right

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
 truck.

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,720
 Because what happens is they're driving through the middle of nowhere at night.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
 I don't know.

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,200
 That's supposed to be a car shifting gears, but whatever.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,000
 So they're driving down the road and at one point, all 20 of them at the same time go,

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,720
 "We're not headed towards the city."

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
 And the driver's like, "How do you guys talk all at the same time?"

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
 And two, "Shut up!"

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
 And so the truck keeps going and it comes to a graveyard.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,160
 The hitchhikers are like, "Uh, this isn't good."

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,880
 And so they jump out, not jump out to run.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,440
 The guys get out of the van and like, "Get out, get out, get out."

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,840
 And they're like, "Push them out of the truck."

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,640
 Actually, you know, now that I'm telling this story, there's some weird inconsistencies

77
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 in it.

78
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,000
 Okay, so first off, we have a truck that can hold 20 people and the guys who are driving

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 the truck.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,800
 So 20 people plus, let's say, three dudes driving the truck, three guys in the cab.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,680
 And they load everyone off the truck and then they give them shovels.

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,760
 So now I have to believe there's 20 shovels in this truck as well.

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,960
 Do they have exactly 20?

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,560
 Was there only 19 and the other guy just kind of stood there waiting his turn?

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,240
 Anyways, the point of the story is, is that the guy said, "You guys got to start digging

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,680
 up some graves for us."

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,360
 And despite the fact that there's 20 of them, I wish I could have found the link for this,

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
 this was a legit news story.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,440
 Despite the fact there was 20 of them, the grave robbers have them dig up a single coffin

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,880
 and throw the body out of the coffin, throw the coffin into the truck and take away off

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,920
 into the night with the coffin.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,200
 And I guess in Zimbabwe because of political strife and AIDS crisis and things like that,

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,640
 coffins are, there's a black market for coffins.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
 They're rare.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,920
 So it wouldn't make sense that someone would want to like grave rob but not the body necessarily

96
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,640
 but just the coffin and the hitchhikers were just stuck in the graveyard.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,800
 Now again, I read that story and I was like, "Oh, that'd be interesting to talk about."

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,400
 But once I started talking about it, I don't think any, I don't even think like a military

99
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,720
 grade truck can hold 20 people and 20 shovels.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,440
 And then if you had that many people, that many shovels, why just take one coffin?

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
 Why not just be like two man teams?

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,720
 You could take 10 coffins.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
 Very ineffective.

104
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
 But anyway, so all the hitchhikers were fine.

105
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,800
 I think that's probably the only story that has, includes the words hitchhiker, graveyard

106
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,760
 and shovel and it ends with nobody dying.

107
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,440
 So good on you Zimbabwe for setting a record on shovel slash hitchhiker slash graveyard

108
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 stories.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,040
 If it's true, because now again that I'm thinking about it, I don't think you could fit that

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,200
 many people in a truck.

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,760
 Okay, our next story.

112
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,880
 So we talked about the Betz Sphere last episode and went through the whole story, the Betz

113
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
 Sphere, Sphere.

114
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,760
 I realized halfway through that episode, I started calling it an orb and I think that

115
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,120
 was almost, I didn't do that on purpose.

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
 I think that was subconscious because I knew I was having a hard time saying sphere.

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
 A couple of times I just used the word the Betz Orb or the mysterious orb, which is

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
 much easier.

119
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
 Anyways, so we went over the story of the Betz Sphere.

120
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,040
 It was this golden, I don't know why I keep thinking it's golden, but it was this orb

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,880
 that was found and there was, in the middle of a field and there was questions of what

122
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
 it was.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
 Was it just a piece of an art project?

124
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,040
 Was it a mechanical ball bearing for a giant valve, alien probe, satellite weapon?

125
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,240
 And then I found additional information that the family didn't mysteriously disappear, they

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,240
 just kind of moved out of the area and faded into obscurity the way they wanted it and

127
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,080
 they still owned possession of the sphere.

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,800
 Now, while I said that I was looking around to find out what happened to the Betz family

129
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,920
 and I made a remark on the last podcast, I had to look through about three pages of Google

130
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,400
 results and I had to type in specifically what happened to the Betz family or where

131
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,800
 are the Betz family now or something like that.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 But I was very specific to say the three pages because on another page I found a website

133
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,800
 that actually is selling the Betz Sphere or more precisely the most powerful part of it.

134
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
 Now again, whoever wrote, whoever's selling this obviously didn't find the information

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I did.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,440
 The people are still alive and they still own the Betz Sphere because these guys have

137
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,680
 a completely different idea of what's going on.

138
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,560
 This is from the website The Haunted Collector.

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,920
 They sell junk and say it's magical.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,720
 And if you poke around on their website enough it says this website's for entertainment purposes

141
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,040
 only, but that won't stop them from taking your money.

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,720
 And they can always say, well it says for entertainment purposes, so a skeptic, so I

143
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,040
 don't really believe this stuff and then somebody believes another like, yeah, legal, I have

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,840
 to put that, but this will make ghosts show up by this ring.

145
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,640
 So anyways, so on the website, briefly they go over the history of the Betz Sphere, I'm

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,920
 not going to repeat that, but this is their story.

147
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:14,360
 We were invited by a secret source to investigate the things that were happening to the ball

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,200
 as they have continued to happen even until this day.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
 These things haven't stopped.

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,080
 The sphere no longer belongs to the Betz family.

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
 It's false.

152
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,160
 Totally false.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,800
 They could no longer handle any of the supernatural crap.

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
 That's not really a good word to put, if you're selling supernatural crap, I wouldn't remind

155
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
 the audience of it.

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,320
 They could no longer handle any of the supernatural crap that was happening on a daily basis in

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 their lives.

158
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,520
 Rather, the ball now belongs, or should say to top secret, but I'm going to have to copy

159
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,000
 it at this as well.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,200
 Rather the ball now belongs to top secret sector, they're missing another word, to the

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,680
 top secret sector of the CIA handling only cases of intergalactic intrigue.

162
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,240
 So CIA is noble as an institution they are at times when they're not poisoning Americans,

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
 sassaning people.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,640
 They're not the people I'd put in charge of any sort of intergalactic group.

165
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
 They don't have any astronauts working for them.

166
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,200
 They don't have any spaceships.

167
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,840
 They don't have any infrastructure to support alien.

168
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,400
 I mean, you would obviously go with NASA or the Air Force or make up a group.

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,560
 The CIA seems fairly mundane.

170
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,400
 You can visit the CIA headquarters.

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,520
 I don't think you can just walk to the door, but you can say "Hey, is there a tour?

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
 You can't?"

173
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,240
 You can just make something up, bro.

174
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
 You're making everything else up.

175
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
 Let's jump ahead here.

176
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,000
 Okay, so the person who's writing this nonsense says he's, I'm assuming it's a he, I don't

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,840
 know why, but this person has a partner named Dee Dee and he says they have worked with

178
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
 the CIA before.

179
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:02,360
 Well, I should not necessarily say with, because we always end up with more than they do, but

180
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,240
 either way you know what I mean.

181
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,200
 I have no idea what you mean.

182
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,960
 You end up with more than they do.

183
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,760
 Like more information?

184
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,280
 Like, I don't know what you mean.

185
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,160
 We were called in to do an investigation and after assuring them we had no idea what was

186
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,920
 going on, we left with two pieces.

187
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,680
 These pieces hold the power that has previously been placed in the stainless steel sphere.

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,680
 So they showed up to the CIA headquarters and they're like "No, we don't know what

189
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
 this is either."

190
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,800
 And then they're like "Hey, can I have a piece of it?"

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
 And the CIA's like "Yeah, sure."

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,880
 Like it doesn't want, it's super bizarre, but they have to get these pieces to sell

193
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,380
 them, obviously.

194
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,280
 So anyways they go on and on and they talk about they don't know what the sphere is,

195
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,240
 but they just know that it's powerful.

196
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
 So they took two pieces of it.

197
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,600
 They took two pieces of the sphere.

198
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,720
 And I'm assuming it's the pieces that are supposedly in the middle of it, but again

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
 how do they get access to it?

200
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,400
 They didn't, obviously, because the Betts family still has it.

201
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,200
 Basically this piece implements a creation power very similar to the one that God used

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,040
 to create the world.

203
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,960
 I want to remind you this is a website called hauntedcollector.com where you can buy stuff

204
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
 via PayPal.

205
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,600
 They're selling the power that God used to create the world and not using it themselves.

206
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 They're going to sell it.

207
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,840
 They're going to turn it into an earring or a ring.

208
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,160
 What we are guessing the sphere was was a piece that was used for the creations of

209
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,320
 world and universes?

210
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 Question mark?

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
 Why is there a question mark there?

212
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
 We have no proof that it's ever been used, but the likelihood of such an active object

213
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
 never being used to slim to none.

214
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
 So is the chances of this actually being real?

215
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,680
 Either way we were able to split the power of the sphere into two pieces.

216
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,040
 Not plural, dude.

217
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,400
 Into two pieces.

218
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,720
 This essentially left the government empty-handed with a sphere that went, okay, another typo,

219
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,800
 that went form doing everything to nothing.

220
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,760
 They will never know that it was us that siphoned the power though because they have no way

221
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 of telling.

222
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,640
 But we now, these two pieces, we now should be, we now have these two pieces.

223
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,880
 Ha ha ha ha.

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,960
 Okay, so they stole the pieces, they stole the most powerful pieces out of the bet sphere.

225
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,840
 The CIA will never find out according to them other than the fact that they just admitted

226
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,560
 it on a website and they are selling those pieces to people via PayPal.

227
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,880
 These, again, these pieces, they allow you to create realities like God, but there's

228
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,600
 a catch only on the astral realm.

229
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,720
 So dreaming, if you buy this, you can dream stuff.

230
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,600
 You can create what it says here, you can create whatever type of realities you want.

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
 As if you were playing a game of the Sims.

232
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,040
 I'm not making this next thing up, I just imagine this person typing this out.

233
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,200
 You can create whatever type of realities you want as if you were playing a game of

234
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,520
 the Sims and then they sat and they looked around the room for 10 minutes and then they

235
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,440
 finished the sentence by saying, "Oh whatever games are out there now."

236
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 Like what?

237
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
 You just say the Sims.

238
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
 If you don't know what other games are out there just be like, "Oh you can create stuff

239
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
 like the Sims."

240
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,480
 And the Sims, the guy is SimCity, SimAunt?

241
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 Which one are we talking about?

242
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,840
 But anyways, I love like the contankerous old man being like, "Oh whatever you kids

243
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,880
 are playing, you can Fortnite stuff, whatever."

244
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
 Go.

245
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,880
 You will be able to create the type of creatures you want in your reality.

246
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,920
 Don't say that because I can already see a bunch of bronies logging in the haunted collector.

247
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,040
 It's hauntedcollector.net by the way.

248
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,640
 You will be able to create the types of creatures you want in your reality and use these creatures

249
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,120
 to create more magical powers and abilities that you will be able to use as they are created.

250
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
 What?

251
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,040
 So you make creatures and then you're like, "I give you the ability to create more creatures."

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,080
 And they're like, "Yes master."

253
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,400
 And then they create more...

254
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 No!

255
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
 That's the worst idea ever.

256
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,920
 You go into your astral... you go back to your astral reality and basically be like if you

257
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,480
 created a bot in Minecraft that you're like, "Hey guys, you build while I'm gone."

258
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,840
 And then you show up the next day and there's just lava everywhere.

259
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,200
 You go to your astral reality, it's going to be a total mess.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,960
 It is a never-ending cycle and you can use this piece as many times as you want to create

261
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,000
 as many different types and styles of existence you want.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Take a look around.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,160
 It is the same magic that has been used to create our universe.

264
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,480
 Just imagine how powerful it is.

265
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,920
 Get this piece and start creating today.

266
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,200
 This object was one of the objects that was made to create the universe.

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,000
 It gives you the same power as God used to create in the universe.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
 They stole it from the CIA.

269
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,720
 The CIA doesn't know that but they admitted it on this website.

270
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:58,000
 The CIA that polices intergalactic policies, they stole this from, gives you the ability

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,680
 to create stuff in the astral realm, gives you the ability to create creatures who can

272
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,400
 create stuff in the astral realm, basically making...

273
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,680
 It gives you the power to make other gods, gives you the ability to create any existence

274
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
 you want.

275
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,200
 How much would you pay for that God level of power?

276
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,560
 Well, they took these little pieces of the bet sphere.

277
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,040
 Apparently there's only two of them.

278
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,840
 Now, I don't know if they've shaved them down so they can sell hundreds of these, but

279
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,040
 they took a piece of the bet sphere, you know, the metallic orb, stainless steel sphere,

280
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,440
 according to them, turned it into a crystal skull, $1,200.

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 $1,200.

282
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,080
 You can buy them on shop.hauntedcollector.net for $1,200.

283
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,440
 You can have the power of a God in your imagination.

284
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
 Here's the thing.

285
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 People are buying this.

286
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
 It doesn't do that.

287
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,280
 They admit it on their website that the website is for entertainment purposes only.

288
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,280
 I just, you know, I think it's funny because it's another addition to the Betts Orb story

289
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,640
 because it was left so mysterious at the end that it did leave people to fill in the blanks.

290
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,680
 And some people are going to fill in the blanks with a creative option.

291
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,800
 And some people are just going to fill in the blanks with, "Let's see what we can get

292
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 away with.

293
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,560
 Let's see if people will buy this thing."

294
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,680
 It shows up in the search results for Betts Sphere.

295
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,520
 Betts Sphere Orb Ball.

296
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 It shows up.

297
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,440
 And I'm sure people have purchased these things.

298
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
 There you go.

299
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,120
 If you want to buy it, if you want the ability to create things that can create things, if

300
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,360
 you want to become your own perpetual machine in your dreams, like it doesn't affect the

301
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,720
 real world, it's just in your imagination, the astral realm, there you go.

302
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,600
 Shop.hauntedcollector.net.

303
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,920
 We may be revisiting them.

304
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
 They got a lot of crazy stuff there.

305
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,600
 Okay, let's jump into Operation High Jump real quick.

306
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
 Now this was actually a request.

307
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,600
 It was kind of a dual request.

308
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,320
 Operation High Jump was specifically requested on YouTube by a user named ToxicRage.

309
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,080
 And then there was a little addendum to it.

310
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,960
 New Swabia by PawnRall.

311
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
 He mentioned that the other day.

312
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,800
 Now Operation High Jump is something that I've been familiar with for a long time.

313
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,920
 And I think it's something that most people are familiar with, just in passing.

314
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,840
 Because again, when I covered the Vril Society, how the Nazis were looking at gaining this

315
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,720
 magical elixir called Vril and it was going to power all their weapons of war and it'd

316
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 be all sci-fi.

317
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,800
 That was something we'd seen in pop culture.

318
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Things like that.

319
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,520
 The Wolfenstein games deal a lot with Vril.

320
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,080
 This is kind of the same thing.

321
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:28,060
 Because this deals with the first big UFO Nazi alliance.

322
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,760
 So there's always this rumor that the Nazis were building UFOs during World War II.

323
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,800
 But so Operation High Jump was the conspiracy theory that what happened was, after the war

324
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,760
 ended, America, we assembled a fleet and the purpose was, the purpose on paper was to set

325
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,640
 up a base in Antarctica.

326
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,120
 And it was not so much to like establish the base.

327
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,560
 But this is, they wanted to train personnel and see how their ships worked in really cold

328
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
 zones.

329
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,840
 They did want to extend American sovereignty over one of the biggest continents.

330
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,440
 Really, they wanted to, there was already little bases there at like outposts.

331
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
 They wanted to say, can we have a bigger baser?

332
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,560
 And they wanted to look at like how to build airfields there.

333
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,480
 They were just using bulldozers and stuff like that to like flat nikes.

334
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
 Then you could have planes landing.

335
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,440
 It was kind of a expeditionary force to look at the realities of basing people out of Antarctica.

336
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,880
 We just got it out of our second world war.

337
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,560
 And so now you kind of want to say, hey, we want to have bases everywhere.

338
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:38,120
 Now New Swabia was a mapping expedition done before the war by Germany where they said,

339
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,920
 we are going to see if we can find a suitable base, suitable place to base.

340
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
 And it was very, very preliminary.

341
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,000
 New Swabia was them charting the coastlines.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,440
 So they did make great maps.

343
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,760
 I mean, I don't want to praise the Nazi government, but they surveyed a lot of Antarctica, the

344
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
 coastline.

345
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,960
 The official story with that is that then they just said, okay, they went back home

346
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,680
 and they said, here's our maps.

347
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,000
 Now, the conspiracy theory is this.

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,520
 When the Allied nations came to Antarctica to check out the region, they said they were

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,720
 going to be there for, I think it was like six months.

350
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
 And they left about four months early.

351
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,360
 And they're just like, you know what, the weather got really, really bad.

352
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,120
 We had to pull out, we had to cut, we did what we wanted to do.

353
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
 We wanted to be there longer.

354
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
 But you know, this was their first big expedition.

355
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,280
 They had like, I think it was like 60 boats, 4700 men.

356
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,120
 It was a sizable thing.

357
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,120
 But they said, you know, the weather was too bad, so we're going to pull back and then

358
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,040
 we're going to wait until the weather's good and then we'll continue our operations.

359
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,120
 And obviously they did because today there's huge outposts and bases there and all that

360
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
 stuff.

361
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,680
 But the conspiracy theory was this.

362
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,640
 We showed up and they were met with resistance.

363
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,640
 They were met with Nazis who had gone there and established New Swabia was a real place,

364
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,160
 an underground base.

365
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,680
 And while the Nazis are underground, they discovered, they met UFO, not met UFOs, they

366
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
 met aliens.

367
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,960
 They're like, hello UFO and the UFO is just sitting there and then the aliens like, I'm

368
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
 over here.

369
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,360
 And they're like, oh, there you are.

370
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 Sorry, I thought that was you.

371
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 Sorry.

372
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,760
 They met the aliens and the aliens are like, oh, racial superiority?

373
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 Yeah.

374
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,680
 No, we're totally down with that for whatever reason.

375
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,760
 You only like like, during races and we're like a different species.

376
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
 Oh yeah, this should work out.

377
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,120
 So the aliens and the Nazis made an alliance.

378
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,600
 Very logical, but they made an alliance and the Nazis and the aliens started flying around

379
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,880
 and they fought off the US troops and the US troops left.

380
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 A couple of people did die during the expedition and some people have said, oh no, it was a

381
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,640
 ton of people and official numbers say no, it was just like a couple.

382
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,160
 So but I mean, you have 60 ships, there's a UFO.

383
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,560
 I guess I'm already debunking it, but the story of this fleet going out and these UFOs

384
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,440
 showing up and they're having this big shootout and us being pushed back and like everyone

385
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
 comes back okay.

386
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,960
 And no one's like, oh, they're like, oh, so honey, how was Antarctica?

387
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,080
 And they're like, oh, the laser beams, man.

388
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,440
 It was just way too much.

389
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
 And they're like, what?

390
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
 And he's like, I mean the weather.

391
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
 Oops, the weather.

392
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,080
 Anyways, so the way this story came out and it's really, really interesting because I

393
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,240
 think we've touched on it a couple of times this week with misinformation stuff intentionally

394
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,680
 being obscured, obviously obscured.

395
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,920
 We'll see what I'm not gonna get too fancy.

396
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,680
 So I'm gonna read you two quotes.

397
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,760
 They actually come from the same source, but two different websites are quoting the source

398
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 differently.

399
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,440
 IE, one of them has the whole quote.

400
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
 Here's quote one.

401
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
 Admiral Bird was one of the leaders during Operation High Jump.

402
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,800
 Admiral Bird declared today that it was imperative for the United States to initiate immediate

403
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,000
 defense measures against hostile regions.

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,600
 Furthermore, Bird stated that he quote, didn't want to frighten anyone unduly, unquote, but

405
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,800
 that it was quote, a bitter reality that in case of a new war, the continental United States

406
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,560
 would be attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible

407
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,280
 speeds, unquote.

408
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,240
 So that is where, so you have this Admiral, this very well respected Admiral, served during

409
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,400
 World War II, a very, very legitimate guy, real guy.

410
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,480
 I don't know him personally, I don't know why I'm vouching for him so much, but by all

411
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,840
 accounts he was a good guy.

412
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,720
 Saying, hey listen guys, I was down in Antarctica.

413
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:39,160
 I don't want to scare anybody, but we need to be prepared to face objects that are flying

414
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,760
 so fast they can go from pole to pole.

415
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,320
 And from that, and there was other, so and then there's a quote, another quote from a

416
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,560
 German Grand Admiral, his name is Carl Donuts, not donuts, but donuts.

417
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:58,320
 And he said that the submarines out in the Arctic area had found another part of the

418
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,640
 world, a Shangri-La land and impenetrable fortress.

419
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,720
 Now we'll handle donuts, we'll just call them donuts, we'll handle his quote first.

420
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,840
 There's no record of him actually saying that on the record.

421
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,800
 We don't have any proof that he actually said that.

422
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
 Most likely was attributed to him later.

423
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,640
 It's a nice image that they had found this thing.

424
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,800
 But let's go back to Bird's quote.

425
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,560
 So I read you the first quote.

426
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:34,160
 Now I had actually started reading the Wikipedia article first and it had this section in it.

427
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,120
 And both of these quotes come from the same thing.

428
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,920
 So what happened was Admiral Bird did an interview in a Chilean newspaper called El Mercurio.

429
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,120
 It seems weird that this American Admiral is being interviewed for a Chilean newspaper,

430
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,200
 but the Antarctic expedition was such a big deal that he was doing the rounds.

431
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,040
 They have footage of him talking about it on like a talk show.

432
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,760
 There is actually an Academy Award winning documentary about them going to Antarctica

433
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
 and Operation High Jump.

434
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,560
 So it wasn't this top secret thing that was done.

435
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,080
 They made a documentary and it won awards.

436
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,480
 And he went on talk shows and talked about his experiences in Antarctica.

437
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:19,200
 So the idea that they somehow, if they had gone out there and fought Nazi aliens,

438
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,960
 they could have just scrubbed the whole thing and just go, "Oh, we never even got there

439
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
 in the first place."

440
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,160
 But instead they come back and the guy's like doing talk shows.

441
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,860
 And it's like one of those old-timey talk shows where everyone's like smoking cigars

442
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,440
 on stage and stuff.

443
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,000
 And there's an Academy Award winning, maybe it was nominated, but anyways it was an Academy

444
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,520
 Award something documentary on going to Antarctica.

445
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,640
 Because it was this kind of this hopeful exploration thing after this horrible, horrible war.

446
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,360
 So anyways, this is what Wikipedia says regarding that article.

447
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,640
 And this is very, very telling.

448
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,400
 This is from the article, from the actual article, article, not the Wikipedia article.

449
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,120
 This is from the article in the newspaper.

450
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,960
 "Amral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of

451
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,760
 protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country," so that matches up, "of hostile

452
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,200
 planes coming from the polar region."

453
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,840
 Now I will give the alien guys this.

454
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,040
 It could be a translation error.

455
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,240
 So he's specifically saying planes in this, but let's switch that to objects.

456
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,200
 Hostile objects from the polar regions.

457
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,880
 I'll give you that because he is an American giving an interview for a Spanish newspaper,

458
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,840
 speaking newspaper, that's then being translated back into English.

459
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,560
 So I'm not going to quibble over planes or objects, but even with the word objects, we'll

460
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,040
 listen to the rest of this and just from the context you'll know what he's talking about.

461
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,920
 They cut out all of the context.

462
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
 Their quote pretty much ends around there.

463
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,400
 The Admiral explained that he's not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that

464
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,320
 in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes, which objects will

465
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
 change into objects, objects flying over one or both poles.

466
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,360
 Again, matches up.

467
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,720
 This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own...

468
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
 recapitulation?

469
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 Doesn't that mean give up?

470
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,920
 Anyways, of his own polar experience, re...

471
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
 whatever.

472
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,400
 I know there's people who are like, "Jason, you're an idiot.

473
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,280
 You're trying to disprove this," and he can't even pronounce words, but whatever.

474
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,560
 It's part of his own recapitulation of his own polar experience in an exclusive interview

475
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,800
 with the International News Service.

476
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 Talking about the recently completed expedition, Bird said that the most important result of

477
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,040
 his observations and discovery is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security

478
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,240
 of the United States.

479
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,560
 The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking, recalled the Admiral, is one of

480
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,600
 the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration.

481
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,640
 I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended where we were able to take refuge

482
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,920
 in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles

483
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 were a guarantee of safety.

484
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:08,200
 What he's talking about is not just planes or objects, but the fact that the world with

485
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:15,120
 the advanced weaponry that was made in the ten years prior to this, we were on the cusp

486
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,080
 of the ICBM.

487
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:24,720
 America had always been an island from conflict, and now things are just going to fly over

488
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
 from anywhere.

489
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,840
 Long range bombers, high speed missiles, satellites, they're already, they got their

490
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,880
 power project paperclip Nazi scientists working on rocket engines.

491
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,400
 That's what he's talking about when he says, and you notice in that he doesn't say anything

492
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,660
 about them flying from pole to pole, but so that's changing that.

493
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,560
 What he's saying is the world is very small and we need to have US assets everywhere,

494
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,320
 because we're no longer safe.

495
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,360
 The weaponry that's been developed by humans, not aliens, can hit America at any time, and

496
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,960
 what happened was ten years later that was the Cold War.

497
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,880
 Was that Russia all the way across the world now had the ability to strike America within

498
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
 half hour?

499
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,640
 When in the 1930s you'd just see the Navy coming, and he's saying the world's smaller.

500
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,600
 So that's what that means, and it's interesting because an entire mythology has built up around

501
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,920
 aliens and Nazis because of stories like this.

502
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,880
 This story takes those little pole quotes and it's a fascinating story.

503
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:32,960
 I mean I think it's an interesting topic of these cold weather US soldiers fighting up

504
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,400
 like UFOs coming and stuff like that and we're like retreat, retreat.

505
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,480
 It's an interesting image, but it didn't happen and they really had to pull out the quotes

506
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
 to get this stuff.

507
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,880
 There was also this thing that the Secretary of State who supposedly knew about Operation

508
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,600
 High Jump, his name was Forrest L. James Forrest L. Sorry, Secretary of Defense.

509
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,360
 Anyways he knew about this and he couldn't keep the secret and he got locked up in a

510
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,280
 mental hospital and then he jumped out of a window and died and people said he was

511
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
 suicided.

512
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
 I looked into that.

513
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,240
 He was a real guy, he did get put in a mental hospital, he got fired from his job as Secretary

514
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,400
 of Defense, he was having some depression issues.

515
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,840
 The hospital didn't want people to know he was there for depression.

516
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,320
 Everyone in depression is put on the first floor so they don't jump out of the window.

517
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,200
 He was put on the 14th floor, jumped out of the window.

518
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 He may have been murdered.

519
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,080
 I'm not going to deny that, but here's my pushback on that.

520
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,040
 If he was killed to cover the story, why wasn't the person writing this article killed before

521
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,520
 the article was published?

522
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,680
 None of the sailors got suicided.

523
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:42,900
 No you're telling me no other official at all in the 20 years after that event.

524
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,160
 After Operation High Jump.

525
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,880
 Which was again a real operation, but none of them, a single one of them had any second

526
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
 doubts about this.

527
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,120
 Just the one guy who happened to die in that 20 year time frame.

528
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,960
 I mean at a certain point, like yeah, it's like the Bennington Triangle thing.

529
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,160
 You can take a big enough period of time and you'll find five outliers and be like, oh

530
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,840
 this guy killed himself, this guy died of some rare disease, ergo, this whole conspiracy,

531
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,940
 this Triangle I drew is true because I can look at all these little weird events happening

532
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,940
 inside of it.

533
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,020
 Even though it doesn't fit anything else.

534
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,340
 The tens of thousands of other people who went on to live their lives just normally.

535
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,940
 A guy did get crushed, I thought this was pretty gruesome.

536
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,940
 They asked this one dude, what's the worst thing you saw in Antarctica?

537
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,780
 Which let me tell you a tip.

538
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,020
 Don't ask veterans questions like that or cops or even construction workers because

539
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,540
 they don't like to relive those stories.

540
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
 Ever.

541
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,580
 Because they go, someone asked what's the worst thing you saw in Antarctica and they

542
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,460
 were probably expecting the grays.

543
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,460
 And the what?

544
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
 No, no, no, no.

545
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,580
 He goes, the worst thing I saw was there was a bulldozer that was used to crush ice, like

546
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,780
 to make ice flat, to make a runway and a dude fell down.

547
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,980
 I imagine he's like running and he's like slipping on the ice and it melted him.

548
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 They just ran.

549
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:08,040
 I mean I guess that's pretty disrespectful to make that noise but just flattened him.

550
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,540
 I mean it's made to crush a continental ice shelf.

551
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,980
 Imagine what it would do to a 180 pound man.

552
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,860
 Don't imagine that actually but anyways.

553
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,340
 Now what's weird, I'll give them this.

554
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,980
 I don't buy the alien Nazi thing.

555
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,020
 Again, why would the aliens, at that point the aliens aren't stupid.

556
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,940
 They would go, you guys lost.

557
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,620
 And you guys are against other people of your own species for being different.

558
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,300
 What are you going to do to us?

559
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,840
 If anything, it would make sense that the aliens would go on the side of the winners.

560
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,720
 The guy, people who had the nuclear bomb.

561
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,600
 Not a bunch of like a rag-tag group.

562
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,480
 However, I will give them this.

563
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,840
 There were reports, substantiated, unsubstantiated, I can't really tell, but there were reports

564
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,840
 that Nazi subs were operating in Arctic regions for a period of time after the war.

565
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,680
 Whether that was them continuing to fight the bad fight, whether that was them just saying,

566
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
 well what do we do now?

567
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,160
 Well let's try to get to South America.

568
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
 Who knows?

569
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,500
 I don't have a lot, or as far as I can tell, any instances of these subs shooting, you

570
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,140
 know, allied chips in the area.

571
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,640
 But there were sightings.

572
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,540
 Could have just been overactive imagination.

573
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,380
 There could have been actual still Nazi subs out there, because what are you going to

574
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
 do?

575
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,540
 You know everyone else is getting hung up there.

576
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,220
 You know you lost the war.

577
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,660
 So you just flown around for a while.

578
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,620
 So I mean there are definitely things.

579
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,260
 And there was Operation Werewolf, which was the original, which is admittedly a badass

580
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
 name.

581
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,960
 Originally when the war was winding down, the Germans were like, let's just go underground

582
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,280
 and we'll fight a guerrilla war for the next 60 years.

583
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,720
 That was Operation Werewolf.

584
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,520
 And the commanders were like, no, that's not a good idea.

585
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
 The South had the same idea.

586
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,440
 They were planning to just fight a guerrilla war for the next hundred years, since cooler

587
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,600
 heads prevailed and said, nah, it's over.

588
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 Let's move on.

589
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
 So anyways, it could have been kind of a byproduct of that.

590
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,600
 It could have just been sub commanders trying to figure out what to do.

591
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,400
 But Antarctica is, like I said in the other episode about the guys dying over there, it's

592
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,000
 a creepy, spooky place.

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,860
 It's completely inhospitable to human life.

594
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,620
 And it's easy for us to make stuff up happen there.

595
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,060
 But at the end of the day, there's really no difference between this story, which has,

596
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:21,060
 which is all based on a quote that is completely taken out of context, and the person selling

597
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,140
 the bets orb pieces.

598
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,100
 It's just, it's fiction.

599
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,100
 It's fiction.

600
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,340
 It's fun fiction.

601
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,500
 It's fun.

602
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,780
 And I enjoyed covering the story, so thank you Toxic Rage and thank you Pon Rolf for the

603
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,680
 new Swabia information as well.

604
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,760
 But it is a story nonetheless.

605
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,200
 So, but so that is the story of Operation High Jump.

606
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,080
 Is, was it just a survey mission that they ended up canceling a little early because of

607
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,680
 the weather and one guy got crushed by a snowball dozer?

608
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,240
 Because we did go back and we did build bases and there's people there now.

609
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,840
 Or was there really this human interplanetary alien war where we fought UFOs with saucicas

610
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,660
 on the bottom of them, got beat, and yet today still have bases all over Antarctica or all

611
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,460
 over the coastlines at least.

612
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:17,940
 No actual working UFOs and the Nazi government is in, well it doesn't exist.

613
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,580
 And I mean, you just got to think about it logically.

614
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,580
 Like at a certain point, it just, it just didn't happen.

615
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,180
 If interesting story.

616
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,020
 And if you step back and you look at it and go, hmm, it just didn't happen.

617
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,840
 I know that kind of a downer note.

618
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:40,260
 If you're into, if you're into Nazi superiority, having access to intergalactic weaponry, sorry

619
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
 if I ruined your day.

620
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,400
 And again, I'm not the final say on any of this.

621
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,640
 If you guys go, oh no, no, here's some more information, I'll be more than willing to

622
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
 look at it.
