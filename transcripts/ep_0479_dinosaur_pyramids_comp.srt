00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 Today we go to the Monroe Institute to get a first-hand look at what the effects of lush

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,800
 may really have on the human psyche. And then I am going to give myself a challenge. I am going to,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,280
 by the end of this episode, prove to you, using science, that prehistoric creatures may have

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,200
 helped build the pyramids today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:35,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,640
 or I'm having a great day. You guys are having a great day too. It was a awfully radio DJ sounding.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,160
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Hoots Cheech. Hoots Cheech,

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,000
 thank you so much for supporting the show. You're going to be our pilot of this episode.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,120
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,000
 That really helps out a lot. We also have a merch store and the Minecraft server is set up for the

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
 new update. So if you want to play the Minecraft server, that'd be awesome. So Hoots, let's go

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
 ahead and give you the keys. We're going to start off in the Jason Jalopy. We're going to take a

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,680
 little drive from Oregon. We are headed out to the Monroe Institute in favor of Virginia. I'm

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
 recording my episode. I'm doing a lot of advanced recording right now because I plan on taking a

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,120
 real vacation soon. I haven't had more than a week off in two years since I'm doing the show.

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,760
 I'm trying to record episodes in batches. So when I take an upcoming vacation, I can actually just

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,880
 sit and watch sci-fi channel movies for three weeks in a row and not have to be recording stuff.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
 I'm taking all my recording gear with me in case there's a late-breaking story, but it'll be nice

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,640
 to just kind of relax. So the reason why I give you that little interlude, and I've been telling

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,800
 the Patreon people that for a while, I've been posting actually previews of upcoming stories

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 because I'm recording so far in advance. The reason why I'm going through all that is I actually

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,040
 am recording this story before the Loosh episode comes out. Now you guys will have already heard

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
 it by now, but I'm going to give you a little behind-the-scenes thing. I don't think that episode

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,600
 is going to be received very well. I think that's an episode I want to get a lot of feedback, a

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,360
 negative feedback on, Loosh feedback on, because it's one of those stories where I kind of, it's

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,560
 a very popular belief system and I was ragging on it for like 20 minutes straight. I imagine that

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,360
 it's an episode that people are going to be upset about. But one of the reasons why I'm

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
 upset about it, and if you don't know what the Loosh is, you don't really have to go back and

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,880
 listen to Friday's episode. This is just kind of a side thing, but I still believe, even though I

30
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,160
 just recorded that episode a couple days ago, I still believe in that time period, and my mind

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,440
 hasn't been changed in 48 hours, that I think any religion, any belief system that's structured around

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,320
 fear is a bad one. I mean, is that something we should all agree on? I think anything that invokes

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,560
 fear in the participants, and you can say, sure, you know, Christianity, Hell and Brimstone and all

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
 that stuff, but the point of most religions is there's hope in the end. If you're a good person,

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,640
 you get rewarded. And good conquers evil. The ideas that are put forth in the stories of Loosh

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
 that I've read online, now I haven't read Robert Monroe's books or anything like that,

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,520
 maybe he has a happy ending at some point, but every time I come across Loosh online,

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,720
 the idea of Loosh, which is that there are archons, I can't pronounce that word a couple days

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,880
 ago, and I can't pronounce it now, there are these interdimensional beings that make us suffer,

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,640
 and we're basically just a farm. The entire planet, all realities of farms, so these creatures

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
 are farmed in our delicious, delicious misery. And the only reason we exist is to live horrible

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,760
 lives and then eventually we get eaten, and it was for nothing. That's really Loosh in a nutshell.

43
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 Apparently there's some way to transcend it, but you know, again, most of the people who come

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,160
 across, most of the stuff I've come across with Loosh, it's pretty, it's pretty heart, it's pretty,

45
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,000
 it's pretty negative. So all that being said, it's just like turning the car around. I don't want

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
 to finish this story. No, no, no, come on, it'll be dope for all fighting over the steering wheel,

47
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,480
 or there's a bunch of Loosh eating aliens floating above the car being like, "Ha ha ha,

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,040
 the chaos in the car is extra delicious." Eventually we get to the Monroe Institute. I

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,040
 read this interesting article and it was too cool to just kind of summarize during my Loosh episode.

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,600
 It was written by Stephen Barling called Cosmic Degrees, Out of Body at the Monroe Institute.

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,640
 And what happens is this dude, this journalist, works for a like alternative magazine it looked

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,120
 like called The Hook, a local alternative magazine. So he decides to check into the

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,200
 Monroe Institute and see what it's all about. The Monroe Institute was really about like astral

54
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,920
 travel, balancing the mind. So you go there, you pay 1500 bucks. Hoots, you got enough money to cover

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,520
 me and all of the listeners. Hoots is not an okay, perfect. 1500 dollars per person. I have that

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,120
 and after Hoots is already paying. And you go in, you basically, it's like you spend mornings,

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,440
 eating breakfast and then you like, like do stuff with people who are like guided astral travel

58
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
 people, they're ghosts. They're all trying to take your credit card at the coins, they're just like

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,040
 dropping through the hands. And then at night you are in a pod. So and that's not a, that's an,

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,000
 you're in an actual pod apparently. There's like these deprivation type chambers or something like

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,840
 that. And so this journalist, Stephen Barling, goes to do this to see what it's all about. It's

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,600
 just kind of a puff piece. And he joins us up and the way just the, I don't know why they did this.

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,400
 I mean, if I'm paying 1500, 1500 dollars for this program, I want my own room. Apparently,

64
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,880
 you have to have roommates with this. And you're not bringing your own astral travel buddy because

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
 you just astral travel at home, right? You just, one person falls asleep in dreams and then you

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,400
 wake that person up and go, my turn. And then you fall asleep and dream. It's funny because on the

67
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,160
 loose episode, I kept making fun of the idea of visions while you sleep. I actually believe, and

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
 I don't know if this came across in Friday's episode, I do believe that you can astrally travel.

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,200
 I do believe that you can project your soul from your body. Now 100% believe that. I don't base

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:09,280
 my belief systems on it because I think one, it's not super easy to do. And two, a lot of it is you

71
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,560
 probably dreaming or having a seizure. Astral travel is actually one of the hippie-dippy things that

72
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,080
 I believe in. But I think it's also something that can easily be a mistake and for a dream or

73
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,560
 a grand-mall seizure. And then you have to go to the hospital. So anyways, if I wouldn't pay 1500

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
 dollars to have someone teach me how to float around, but I mean, if they could guarantee it,

75
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
 right? I'd be like, what? Yeah, here's all my money. And then I'm floating to the bank,

76
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,600
 canceling my check, but you have to share a room with someone. So anyway, Steven goes in and he

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,240
 signs up for a $15 program and he meets a guy like they're in this big meet and greet in the

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
 beginning. He meets a guy named Jack. Now Jack is not his real name for obvious reasons coming up.

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,720
 They had just had dinner as a group. Someone says they're going to bring out Cherry Pie and

80
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 Steven starts going, "Pie? A pie? Oh, a pie?" Like just joking around. Actin' like he's really excited

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,480
 for Cherry Pie. And Jack turns and stares to Steven and goes, "Pie?" Everyone's like, "What?

82
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,560
 What was that? Well, yes, we're having pie. No, that's not what this means."

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 Jack goes on to tell this story, okay? He used to have a problem with pie. Now, not in the delicious,

84
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,280
 yummy food, but in the number. In that magical, mystical number known as pie, which I never got

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
 the big deal about, but I'm not a math dude. I guess maybe it is something awesome. But anyways,

86
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,120
 four years earlier, we go back into Jack's past and he's sitting there and he's like in his house

87
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,320
 and everything's pie. Everything's pie. Like that's all he's talking about. He's writing it down

88
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,360
 everywhere. He's like waking his wife up in the morning. "Hey, guess what? Guess what? Pie."

89
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,800
 Like that's a bit of an exaggeration, but not much because he becomes obsessed with pie. Actually,

90
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,720
 that might be an understatement. He becomes so obsessed with pie, the implications of what pie

91
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,520
 means that he will not stop talking about it. Eventually, his wife gets so concerned, she calls

92
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,640
 the police and the police finds out that he's a licensed federal gun dealer. So they call in SWAT.

93
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:21,440
 Call in the SWAT unit for this pie guy and then we get to this great quote in this article. "So,

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,400
 I don't actually, before I start the quote, I don't know if SWAT showed up before, during, or

95
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,720
 after this. I think that it was during because all this stuff seemed to be going on, but if it was

96
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,640
 during, I can't imagine the SWAT team walking past this dude or maybe they were even confused by what

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,880
 was going on." Here's this quote from this article. "Jack found himself naked in the street,

98
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,560
 demanding to speak to a mathematician as flak-jacketed teams ransacked his house.

99
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,120
 So the reason why I don't know, so I'm imagining like, did he walk past him? He's like,

100
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
 'Good morning, gentlemen.' And he's taking his clothes off and the SWAT team's like,

101
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
 'We better just secure the house and make sure there's no, we know he doesn't have a gun. He's

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
 taking his clothes off. He's naked.' So while SWAT is kicking in his door, looking for his guns,

103
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,320
 he's outside going, 'Does anyone have the number of a mathematician? I must know pie.' So he obviously

104
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,440
 went off the deep end. He tells everyone at the table the story and then they tell Stephen,

105
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,560
 the author of the piece. And everyone knew he was a journalist, but they go, 'Oh, guess who's

106
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,600
 going to be your roommate? It's Jack. It's the pie guy.' But Stephen goes, 'He seemed to be pretty

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,360
 fine by now. He had all his clothes on, right? That's a plus. That's a starter.' He did actually

108
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,560
 end up going to a mental hospital for a while after that, but and he's no longer allowed to possess

109
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,520
 a gun, so he had to get a new job. But now it's his roommate. So the next morning they wake up

110
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,880
 and they're like sitting around in a classroom and they're asking about their dreams because they

111
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,360
 have to listen to like binaural beats. Can't pronounce that word still either. While they're

112
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
 sleeping and they try to invoke visions and stuff like that. And spoiler alert, Stephen said he went

113
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
 through all this stuff. He didn't really have any visions. He didn't really feel like it was doing

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
 what it was supposed to be doing. He also started off by saying, 'I'm not a skeptic, but I'm not really

115
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
 a believer either.' He's open to this type of experience, but he didn't really think it worked

116
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,280
 out. But anyway, so Jack is, they're doing their meeting the next day. Jack goes, 'I had a dream

117
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,880
 that this was Survivor. This was a television show, 'Show Survivor,' because this story takes place

118
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,520
 like in 2008. It's the show 'Survivor,' and you got voted off and he points at Stephen. Stephen's like,

119
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,480
 'Oh, this is going to get weird, right?' Then a couple days pass and Jack, they're doing this whole

120
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,520
 meeting thing again and Jack goes, 'I had another dream.' 'I had a dream that you.' He points at

121
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,040
 Stephen again, his roommate. The man who has to sleep next to him while he's trapped in a pod,

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 which I don't know if being in a pod would make you feel safer. Or I think it would be more scary

123
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,280
 if you slept in an egg, right? Like you're more commending. That's an old reference. Like, okay,

124
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,800
 just imagine a chicken in an egg. That makes more sense. You're in an egg, right? You're in a pod,

125
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,080
 and there's a crazy person outside the pod. Technically, you're safe in the pod. Not an egg,

126
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,920
 they just crack the egg, but you're safe in the pod. But the thing is, pods are generally built to

127
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,480
 be open from the inside and the outside. So now, if a crazy person opens up your pod, where are you

128
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
 going to run? Like on a bed, you can usually roll off on one side and like crawl underneath it,

129
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,600
 or just stand up and walk away. Rather than being trapped in a pod, I imagine being like

130
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,960
 getting in a tanning bed and seeing like a silhouette walking up next to you and just

131
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,160
 standing there would be far scarier than if you were laying in your bed right now and you saw

132
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,840
 a silhouette standing at the edge of your bed. I mean, I guess they're both scary, right? But one

133
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,720
 of them you can maneuver. One of them you can duck and weave, duck and weave. Anyways, Jack now

134
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
 tells us another dream about Steven, where Steven was driving a male car like a box van down the

135
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,680
 road and plows into a group of people. And you can just imagine what Steven is thinking at this

136
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,440
 point. Like dude, first off, this cost me $1500. Secondly, it's not working. And third, can I get

137
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
 a new, can I please get a new roommate? Jack says he has this dream where Steven's driving a car and

138
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 he plows into a group of people, killing them. And one of the people in the group was a young boy

139
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,240
 and then the boy begins to morph into like a fetus, like 2001, like a big old baby.

140
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,320
 And then Jack realizes that he was the boy and Steven killed him.

141
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,600
 Come on man, give me another room dude. Like seriously, first he's having dreams where I

142
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,240
 get voted off the island, which whatever, but now he's having dreams where I murder, murder him.

143
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,040
 He turns into a space baby. Like please, I will pay you an extra $1500 for another room.

144
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,520
 And so then really to make a long story short, the other people in the group, all Jack wants to

145
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,080
 do is talk about Jack. Every time they, you know the guy, you know that type of person, right?

146
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,200
 Every time a story comes up, Jack goes, oh, oh, you had a dream about murdering someone, so did I.

147
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
 Wait, it wasn't me, it was Steven, but I was the victim. And then someone's like,

148
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,280
 hey, does anyone have any orange crush? Orange crush? I used to crush oranges back on the vineyard.

149
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,760
 People are like, orange is still growing on the vineyard. What? Vineyard? I used to drink wine,

150
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
 like, you know, no matter what, right? They always have a story. And so eventually someone said,

151
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 listen, I've experienced stuff too. Can someone else tell their story?

152
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:38,400
 And at that point, Jack fell totally silent and then went completely off the rocker. Here's the,

153
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,880
 here's this quote from this article. That was it. He never fully came back. After sitting quietly

154
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,240
 through the rest of the group session, Jack began his descent. And by the next day, he was in full-time

155
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,720
 channeling mode and had to be separated from the group. They took him off the tapes. He could no

156
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,400
 longer listen to the Byron Earl tapes. He's like, oh, man, that was my favorite song. Put it on a

157
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,720
 Spotify playlist. It's all, he's flipping them out. He had to start seeing an on-site psychologist.

158
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,920
 Eventually he had such a deep, like mental breakdown, they had to call his mom to pick him up.

159
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
 And then Steven basically ends the article being like, it's a wacky place. It's a wacky place.

160
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,640
 He said the most normal people there were the people who worked there, which was odd considering

161
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,200
 they were talking about astral projection all day long. So that's the story of Jack and Steve.

162
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,160
 And I thought it was an interesting little microcosm of just the conspiracy world, the world of

163
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,880
 fringe beliefs just kind of melt. You have someone who comes in, who's an outsider. He's just like,

164
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
 oh, that's kind of an interesting topic. And I think that's how most of us view this stuff.

165
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
 I mean, obviously I've spent decades of my life researching it, but I'm always like, oh, you know,

166
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
 I'm always looking for something cool, new, something, and I never give too much credit for it.

167
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,400
 I'm just like, oh, that's interesting. And then you have people who just dive in headfirst and

168
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,360
 whether it's a belief that the number Pi can unlock the universe. Oh my God, I hope he never

169
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,280
 saw that movie. I hope that Jack knows. He's tearing off Ragnosky, I've been around his name.

170
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,880
 It's the actual director of Pi. After this incident, he's like, ah, well, I got kicked out.

171
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,680
 I got attacked by SWAT and I got kicked out of the Monroe Institute. Maybe I'll make a movie.

172
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,600
 And then I'll follow it up with a really long boring movie called The Fountain.

173
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,720
 That could be Darren. Don't sue me if it's not or if it is. But I think it's an intro microcosm.

174
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,480
 We have the tourist who's the journalist just trying to get an interesting story. And I think

175
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,840
 this was an interesting story. Then you have the person who jumps in, pays the $1,500,

176
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,120
 goes full bore with it and loses it. And whether it was being isolated from his support group,

177
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
 maybe it was the binaural beats, maybe it was being the center of attention. Every time he

178
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,880
 told a story, people were paying attention to him. And it just, when they stopped paying attention,

179
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,960
 he lost it. But it's an interesting look at that those two aspects of the paranormal community.

180
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,400
 I think most of us are curious about this stuff. We're tourists. We may take a couple of the

181
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,400
 subjects more seriously than other subjects. And then there are other people and you guys have

182
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,080
 seen them online or maybe know them in real life. No matter what the conspiracy theory is,

183
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,400
 no matter what the belief is, they believe it 100%. And the people who believe all conspiracy

184
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,200
 theories, you know, they may be right on 10% of them. But the other 90% they're wrong. They're

185
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,440
 wrong. And you know what? When you're wrong, you end up eating a slice of humble pie. Hoots,

186
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,880
 cheech, let's hop in that carbonar copter. We are leaving behind the Monroe Institute. We're headed

187
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,640
 out to Egypt. Now, this was a challenge I gave myself. This is a topic on the conspiracy theory

188
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,480
 iceberg. This is a topic I got off the conspiracy theory iceberg. And again, hats off to some

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,680
 weirdo on Twitter, aka Jack, different Jack, different Jack for putting together this all in

190
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 Excel document, because it's really made it easy for me to go through. Hoots, let's bring it down.

191
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,680
 We're flying over Egypt. And we see those great pyramids. That's the first thing you think of

192
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,440
 when you think of Egypt, right? You think of the pyramids, you think of the Sphinx, and then the

193
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,080
 desert. And then if you live there, you think, "Mom, Dad, I love you guys." But for, you know,

194
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,800
 the other 98% of the planet, the pyramids and the Sphinx. On the conspiracy theory iceberg,

195
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,320
 we have the conspiracy theory. Dinosaurs helped build the pyramids. And I looked at that and I

196
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,760
 did some research on it. And I thought, I'm gonna make this work. I'm gonna make this work. Using

197
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,280
 science. Using science. Let's see how close I can get you guys on this. Neocreationists is the term

198
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,880
 I like to use. There's a lot of people who are creationists, and I would consider myself in this.

199
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,000
 I believe that God created the universe, but I believe that, and there goes 50 subscribers, but

200
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,440
 hold on. I believe that he created it in the realm of science, if that makes sense. I don't believe

201
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,880
 he created it in seven days. I think that when you look at the Hebrew word for day, it means epoch

202
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,480
 or era in that translation. So he built it over time and evolution's real. I believe all that

203
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,400
 stuff and God is a guiding hand through all of that stuff. Neocreationists is the term I use for

204
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,800
 these guys. Are the guys who believe that the world is only 6,000 years old. Now in that theory,

205
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,600
 there is stuff saying that dinosaurs helped build the pyramids. That's foolish, right? They'll have

206
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,560
 like drawings of a brontosaurus pulling a brick. It's super funny looking, but that's not real,

207
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,520
 right? Right? It's not right now. Dinosaurs, the best estimate we have is they died out 65 million

208
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,200
 years ago, even if that number is wrong by double half whatever, 30 million years ago, even if it's

209
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,760
 wrong and fourths 15 million years ago, it's still nowhere even close to the rise of humans, or even

210
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,000
 close to the stone age or anything like that. So when you look at the term did dinosaurs help

211
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,600
 build the pyramids, I think right there we can say no, but stick with me. Stick with me. I might

212
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,160
 surprise you on this. The pyramids were built around 2500 BC, according to our best radiocarbon

213
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,240
 evidence. Now some people say that that is taken from the wood inside the pyramid and the wood

214
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,880
 may actually be newer than the construction of the pyramid itself. Let's table that for a second.

215
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,400
 When we look at Egyptian artwork, Mesopotamian artwork, there's a creature known as the

216
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,680
 Serpapard, the Serpapard, the Serpapard. It's a cross between a leopard and a serpent. It's a

217
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,680
 leopard with the long neck of a snake. Now people have said that's a really weird design, because

218
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,080
 here, let me read you this quote. The Egyptians are well known for their accurate depictions of

219
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,080
 animals, leading some archaeologists to believe that the Serpapapard is not a mythical creature,

220
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,760
 but an extinct animal that existed during that time. Where did I get that quote? I got that quote

221
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,480
 from Cryptid Wiki. Now sure, they're not an Egypt specific website, but again, let's think about

222
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,200
 that for a second. In other places other than Cryptid Wiki, they do talk about this Serpapard.

223
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,080
 And some people have said, well maybe that is their version of a dinosaur that helped them build

224
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,480
 bricks, carrying these big bricks up the pyramids and things like that. But it's interesting because

225
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,080
 people don't know what to make of that. People say everything else in the Egyptian

226
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,240
 bestiary is real. I mean, when I read that I go, yeah maybe, what about the dude with the dog head,

227
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,520
 right? Like that guy's not real. Anubis? That dude's not real, as he kicks in my door, he's like,

228
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,760
 I am real. Sorry Anubis, but I mean, probably not real. Probably not real, right? Get ready to eat my

229
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,440
 loosh. So even if these things were real, even if this was a contemporary creature of the Egyptians

230
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,760
 that died off, according to the measurements that we can pull off, they're only three feet tall at

231
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,000
 the shoulder and 30 feet long from the neck to the tail. So from the head to the tail. So

232
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,360
 those things may or may not have existed. Again, it is weird that everything else appears to

233
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,560
 match up according to Cryptid Wiki. And again, other sites said that, but it is weird that everything

234
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,480
 matched up. But even if that's the case, they weren't big enough to be carrying rocks, you could

235
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,080
 throw your kids on the back of them and go for a ride, it'd be totally awesome. But I don't think

236
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,440
 they're going to help you build the pyramids. Hear me out. Hear me out on this. Robert Beval is an

237
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,640
 author and he's a guy who came up with a fringe theory that the pyramids match up to Orion's

238
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,280
 belt. And what's funny is I heard that theory for the longest time. Orion's belt, if you don't know,

239
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,440
 it's a constellation in the sky. It's not an actual guy was walking by with a belt and they're like,

240
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,480
 well golly, stand there for a thousand years. We're going to match this up. Orion's belt,

241
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,760
 the constellation in the sky, the pyramids match up to it perfectly. And I've heard that stated

242
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,280
 over and over and over again. And it's one of those things like the ancient astronaut theory and all

243
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,280
 of that. And the Sphinx was built from what they can tell us that the Sphinx was not built at the

244
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,120
 same time of the pyramids. It was built about 500 years earlier than the pyramids. So it's older

245
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,800
 than the pyramids and some people think it could be far older. There's a new theory appearing and

246
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,360
 again people say it's a fringe theory but based on water erosion it could be way older than we

247
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,320
 think it is. But we'll go with the general science. I'm going to go right now with the numbers that

248
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,760
 the pyramids were constructed in the year 2500 BC. The pyramids as we know were constructed in the

249
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,000
 year 2500 BC and the Sphinx was constructed about 500 years earlier than that. But Jason

250
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,480
 Priestork animals weren't around in 2500 BC. Unless these serpipods were running around

251
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,840
 there weren't a Priestork animals in 2500 BC. Hold up. Robert Bevall has a theory, it's a

252
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,600
 fringe theory, that the pyramids match up to Orion's belt and the Sphinx matches up to a star as well.

253
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:45,840
 But the only time, which is true, they do match up to that. But the only time it would have matched

254
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,480
 up because you know constellations move around, everything's constantly moving. The only time

255
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,200
 that Orion's belt would have been perfectly aligned with Egypt. So like the distances and the degrees

256
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,080
 you could figure out, it looks like Orion's belt. But the only time that Orion's belt would be over

257
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:11,360
 Egypt was in 10,000 BC. And the pyramids, so his argument was that the pyramids are far older.

258
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,040
 The pyramids were built in 10,000 BC and all the radiocarbon dating is wrong.

259
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:25,360
 But I want to go with science on this one. I'm trying to use as much real science as possible.

260
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,000
 Now I could throw out the radiocarbon dating. I could go, "Eh, it doesn't work." And apparently it

261
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,520
 doesn't work any, going forward, after 1950 it will never work. It doesn't work because there's so

262
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,480
 much radiation in the air. Before 1950 we can match stuff up. And there's, it's been contested and

263
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,720
 stuff like that. But I don't want to get into that. Let's say that yes, the pyramids were built in

264
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,680
 2500 BC and the Sphinx was built before that. How do they match up to Orion's belt? Now again,

265
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,680
 Egyptologists say it doesn't or it's just a coincidence or it does, but they just kind of

266
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,480
 looked at it and it was at a distance and that and that. Robert Bavall says if at 10,000 BC

267
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,960
 those stars are perfectly lined up to the pyramids. Hear me out. This is where I'm going to make my

268
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,720
 case. You know that the Christian church has a bad habit of doing this. I don't know if they do it

269
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,800
 anymore. I think they've kind of done it as much as they can. But when you would have a holy site

270
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,120
 that was created by another religion, say like a druid or a pagan religion or something like that,

271
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,240
 they would knock it down. You'd get a ring in the forest where pagans used to go there,

272
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,360
 dance naked, talk about pie all the time, a swat is kicking in some elf door. They're right in this,

273
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,880
 they're right in the dwarf fortress. The Christian church would build a chapel on top of it.

274
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,360
 They'd go to these places that were being used for hundreds of years by paganistic religions.

275
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,800
 They knock it over, they build a church on it. Now I have a theory about that. A lot of people go,

276
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,720
 it's so the people like, let's say you're in Ireland and you worship some ogre or whatever,

277
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,320
 whatever pagans worship, a big tree. And there goes another 50 subscribers, my pagan listeners.

278
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,040
 The church would come down, chop down the tree, put it up basically to one,

279
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,840
 subvert the local power. They say, nope, we're the most powerful people in town.

280
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,360
 Two, so that way all the Irish people know where to go, right? Because they're like, hey,

281
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,960
 where's church at? And they're like, where did you, Seamus, where did you pray last week?

282
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,320
 I prayed at the giant tree. Well then just pretend it's a tree, but you're going to walk

283
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,440
 inside, you're going to sit down instead. I can walk inside a tree, just go there.

284
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,640
 So they would know where it was basically, they wouldn't need directions. I have an idea,

285
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,480
 I have a theory that this is throwing out the science thing for a second, but I have a theory

286
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,920
 that there are certain, the reason why that tree or that glen was picked by the pagans in the first

287
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,000
 place, because it held power. I know I said I was going to talk about science, but it held an

288
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,240
 intrinsic power in and of itself. And the Christian church, when they came in, they weren't, they

289
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,840
 picked up on the power as well. Holy ground is holy ground. Holy ground is holy ground. So

290
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,440
 whether it's holy because it was to Artemis or it's holy because it's to Saint Michael,

291
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,880
 it's holy ground. And it's been holy for tens of thousands of years before people even stumbled

292
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,400
 across it. That's my theory. I think that the reason when you had the churches being built,

293
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
 that was one of the reasons they go, well, we can already feel this place is powerful,

294
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
 there's a presence here. It has nothing to do with science. And they're probably muddying the

295
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,120
 issue. But anyways, that's what I think. But regardless of my theory or the general theory that

296
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,040
 they were just knocking, the Christians just like knocking down trees, building churches there,

297
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,480
 I think it's a useful tactic either way, right? But who's to say that the modern Christian church

298
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,080
 pioneered that effort? I always know, I always hear about it of the Christian church. But who's

299
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,560
 to say that other groups haven't done that? Who's to say that the Druids who found that glen,

300
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:10,240
 there wasn't a Stone Age monument there before the pagans got there. The Bramble had been cleared

301
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,760
 out by hand. A tribe that had long been decimated considered that spot holy. Again, because holy

302
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,600
 land is holy land. What if the pyramids were built in 2500 BC, but the specific locations,

303
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:34,320
 the layout of the pyramids, was laid out in 10,000 BC when a Stone Age tribe of Egypt looked up at

304
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:43,120
 the sky and saw Orion's belt aligned perfectly with this patch of land. Now they didn't have the

305
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:51,680
 ability to make pyramids. They weren't able to pour concrete or work these giant mechanisms. I do

306
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,760
 believe the pyramids were built by humans too. I guess there's no aliens aren't going to show up

307
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,080
 anywhere in the story. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but they didn't have the ability to do that level

308
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,280
 of engineering, but they knew that this was a special place, a special point in time where they

309
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,640
 could look up and see these stars. So they did what they could do. They do what we've seen so many

310
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,280
 other cultures do around the world. They built mounds. They built mounds marking the spots

311
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:27,760
 of the Orion's belt and then that star where the Sphinx would later lay. You could mark that territory

312
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,200
 and it wouldn't have to be anything that would stand the test of time and most likely wouldn't,

313
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,120
 right? The Stone Age culture that built these mounds or depressions or whatever they were to mark

314
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,840
 this point where this beautiful star arrangement aligned perfectly over Egypt. This Stone Age

315
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,200
 tribe does it and then when they're wiped out and another tribe comes in and they're wiped out and

316
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,000
 another tribe comes in and eventually we move to the Bronze Age. We move on through the ages. When

317
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 the pyramids are being built there's no historical record as to why they're there, but they put

318
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,120
 them there perfectly, matches up to Orion's belt to mark these places as holy forever rather than

319
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:20,720
 just earthworks, mounds. If that area of land was marked to match Orion's belt, which matched up to

320
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:31,120
 the year 10,000 BC, mammoths did not die out until 8,500 BC. So we would have a 1500 year period,

321
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,480
 so we would have, we know humans do not run alongside dinosaurs as dope as that would be.

322
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,800
 Almost makes me want to be a neocreationist, right? But that just didn't happen. But humans did live

323
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,040
 alongside mammoths. They didn't wake up and pet them in the morning, but they hunted them.

324
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:54,880
 Why couldn't they have taken them as beasts of burden, train them to be beasts of burden,

325
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,040
 maybe little baby ones, and use these massive creatures who actually weigh as much as a tyrannosaurus

326
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,680
 wrecks. I didn't know that until I was researching this, and use them to make these earthworks,

327
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:12,400
 these massive markers that match up perfectly with Orion's belt. These wouldn't

328
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:18,880
 show up in any sort of historical reference today, other than the fact that it marked a place in time

329
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,200
 that would only exist in 10,000 BC. The pyramids don't have to be built in 10,000 BC.

330
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,360
 They only have to be, the locations only have to be marked in 10,000 BC.

331
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,280
 Like we have the major earthworks of the Native Americans, still here in America,

332
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:42,640
 where they took their time and they made these giant mounds marking these areas.

333
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,120
 My using, I should have said this earlier, with a conspiracy cap fully on,

334
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,320
 using science and the phrase, "Did dinosaurs help build the pyramids?" I think we can state a

335
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:06,000
 reasonable hypothesis that a Stone Age tribe used mammoths to mark this area. And why mammoths?

336
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,600
 Because they didn't need mammoths, right? But it just makes the conspiracy theory work.

337
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,120
 And why not mammoths, right? But the mammoths aside, the mammoths make it one fitness theme,

338
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,960
 prehistoric creatures help build the pyramids. But two, I think that you don't need to have the

339
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,200
 pyramids built in 10,000 BC for this to make, to work, because the pyramids could be built in

340
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,120
 2,500 BC. The pyramids could have been built in 2,500 AD. The point is, is that they were,

341
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:45,760
 that area was marked in some fashion in 10,000 BC to celebrate that star alignment over Egypt.

342
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,520
 You can take this episode as a cautionary tale of what happens when you spend

343
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,600
 too much time looking at Excel spreadsheet full of nonsense sayings, or you can take a look at it

344
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,800
 and go, "That's what happens when you take a conspiracy theory and work backwards."

345
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:12,560
 You can make almost anything sound plausible, even did prehistoric animals help build the pyramids.
