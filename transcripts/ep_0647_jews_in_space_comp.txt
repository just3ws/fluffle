 It's too hot for YouTube week. These are all the stories that I put off telling because I knew YouTube
 Wanted to allow them anyways first off
 There's a cheese out there. They would have allowed this story, but I have to do an introduction story and it's a good one
 There's a cheese out there. That's so
 disgusting
 It's illegal to eat and
 Then we meet a man who believes that the Jewish people came from outer space
 with one mission
 To protect us from cryptids today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I had a great weekend
 I hope you guys had a great weekend too. Coming at you live from the new studio
 The haunted closet that is the name of the studio and it actually is a haunted closet and I have some even more improvements
 I have some sound balancing stuff
 So I hope this sounds even better than it did last time
 We're making improvements to this show because this show is going to be around for a long time
 And the reason why the show keeps growing is because of patreon supporters like Sam everyone give a round of applause to Sam
 He is walking into the Arab command playing a little piccolo
 And all these kids are following him and doing these dances and something like that. We're like hey Sam
 Why'd you bring all those kids to the not even now? Why do you have a bunch of kids following me? He's like I'm the fight Piper
 I love that episode. I actually don't know if you love that episode
 But he's the fight Piper and the kids are just like what are we doing here?
 And we're like, we'll have to feed you guys and we'll get you home to your parents soon
 But Sam until then the kids are now part of this crew and Sam
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you don't kidding
 Have children in mass. That's great. Don't do that second thing. But if you don't support the patreon
 Help get the word out about the show. Tell your friends. Tell your family talk about it online
 That's what we need you to do to help the show grow now Sam
 Go ahead and fire up. We've got all these kids. We're gonna need some of our big vehicles
 Let's hop in the dead rabbit dreadnought
 We'll put it in your little kid arms to work as they're rowing in the galley
 You're gonna be the captain of this dreadnought. We're leaving behind dead rabbit command. We are headed out to
 Sardinia
 Being in the big old drum the kids were like my arms hurt
 I'm like only a thousand more miles kids. We're almost there. So we all get off of this boat
 We give the kids some some fruit juice. They'll need those electrolytes for the journey back and
 Sam is leading us into a small village in Sardinia now Sardinia is actually an island in the Mediterranean
 It's off the coast of Italy. We're here to taste the delicacy
 It's called kazoo Martzu
 It's supper. This is great. It's supper time not only a supper time. It's some kids birthday
 They use this for birthday celebrations and wedding celebrations. It's a delicacy
 Everyone lives this and I have my little napkin tied around my neck and I have my fork in my knife
 And I'm like come on guys. Let's run. Let's go get some Kazoo Martzu
 And we sit down and they bring out a big block of cheese
 Mmm-hmm. You love the smell of cheese
 I say to you as the smell is not hit your nose yet and you look down at it and it's like
 Melted cheese in the middle of this wheel of cheese kind of like queso you guys love queso, right?
 I'm already taking three or four bites. Yum. Yum. Yum. Just dig in guys and you're looking at each other
 Sam is hijacking the boat to leave leave us all behind Kazoo Martzu. It's illegal
 This cheese cannot be purchased to come out be eaten probably can't be transported
 You just roll in a wheelchair on the road cops are chasing after you Kazoo Martzu literally means putrid cheese
 Now they've been making this cheese for thousands of years
 They're actually trying to get it made not illegal the people of Sardinia goes this is a traditional food
 Haggis is disgusting right a bunch of people eat disgusting stuff. Why can't we eat Kazoo Martzu?
 We've been doing this forever and the government's trying to get the the European Union. It's illegal in the United States as well
 You can't even eat it where it's made they can bust you there
 It's like it's like a black market thing although the local cops aren't gonna kick down your door because you're eating this
 Disgusting food they might kick down your door to eat some as well. This is what you do now
 We're all in farmer outfits Sam is teleported back to the group. He's like great
 We're milking a sheep get that nice warm body temperature sheet milk right out of the other
 Then we take it back and you cook it
 That sounds normal right there's nothing wrong with drinking sheep's milk and
 You know that's how normal cheese is made but you cook it you get the curds all together you make a normal block of
 Percogno
 Percogno
 One of the two who make one of those that sardinians are looking at us like great. He's gonna butcher everything
 The word butcher
 You take you make a normal wheel of Pekino and you go ah
 Monza Monza and they're like not yet not yet
 You then take this wheel of Pekino and you cut the top off of it
 So you know like cheese gets kind of waxy on the outsides, but we want to expose the gooeyness of the insect
 You cut the top off of the wheel you take it off and then the flies show up
 You like that perfect you thought it was actually a fly flying around you
 They'll land on the cheese and then they start going that's my time to shine
 And they start laying eggs and
 The way that this cheese is made is the the people eat this
 People have eaten this for thousands of years the flies lay eggs on the cheese
 The eggs hatch circle of life
 maggots come out of them
 The maggots then begin eating the cheese they digest the cheese and their little maggot tummies
 And then poop out a little bit of that cheese
 They sound like that but you can hear them
 Then you let this process go on and on and on for two to three months
 So it's not just like one maggots pooping on your cheese
 This is actual quote from Wikipedia by the time it is ready for consumption
 A typical kazoo mart zu will contain
 thousands of these maggots
 So it's not just one which would be bad
 I'm not saying if you're ever eating spaghetti and there's one maggot in your spaghetti
 You're like, ah Jason said this is a problem, right?
 Disgusting either way so these little maggots they're about they're about eight millimeters long and these little maggots
 It's like one-third of an inch. They're super tiny, but you can see them
 They're a little white translucent maggots and they just kind of eat through cheese and they make it soft
 They make the inside of the cheese super soft. So it is kind of like queso
 Sorry if you're eating queso right now. You're looking for maggots
 And you go Jason listen, we all know that cheese is just like old milk
 It's like curdled milk and stuff like that it you let it turn orange or I didn't look about cheese was made
 I'm just
 Remembering some of the Sesame Street I saw back in 1979 the cheese is old milk
 Like this is just an added part of the digestive process and sure I don't appreciate
 Maggots in my food and you say
 But you know, it's it's really no grosser than just leaving milk out overnight or again
 Whatever Sesame Street said in 1979. Okay, let's get ready to eat some kazoo Marchu
 So we each get our own wheel because we're clients
 We each get our own wheel and I'm already scooping it in yum yum yum
 And you see me I'm put it this is how they traditionally take it they take scoops of it
 They spread it across a piece of flatbread and they eat it. So you see me I've been doing that and you notice
 When I put a little bit on the flatbread I then kind of cover the top of the flatbread
 I'm like holding almost like I'm eating food in jail and don't want anyone else to steal it
 Like that's weird. Why does he keep covering his food? Is he afraid like rains gonna fall on his food?
 You look up the sky perfectly clear and that's when you're looking down at your own kazoo Marchu and you realize
 The maggots are still in the cheese
 You are supposed to eat the maggots
 That's part of the delicacy the people do this when you eat it you spread it across the flatbread
 You'll cover up the top of the flatbread so they don't jump off of you and land in your face
 Or maybe you're like I don't want to lose my delicious maggots. You don't want them to jump
 You're licking your hand. You're licking your other hand. You're not getting away from me maggots
 Yes, this is the end of season 13 the last week is going out with a bang get ready for season 14 soon
 Licking the maggots right up your hand. It's actually considered the cheese is considered ruined
 It's unhealthy if the maggots are dead in the in the cheese, which that should go just go without saying if there's ever dead maggots in your food
 It's unhealthy
 but
 If let's say you don't like maggots, let's say you're one of those weirdos out there
 Let's say you're one of the 2% of the human population who doesn't like to eat maggots
 You can't wait for the maggots to die naturally because that's gross
 What you can do is you can take you spread some cheese and you put it on a cracker and then you put the cracker in a zip lock bag and
 Then oh did I mention these?
 These maggots can jump up to six inches. I didn't mention that. That's why you have to protect it
 I think I said they could jump I didn't think I said they could jump half a foot
 So you spread it on this cheese you put it in the zip lock bag you close it and as the maggots are suffocating
 You will see them jump off of the cheese and hit the sides of the zip lock bag
 You'll hear it go. I'm not making this up. This was in Wikipedia. They go
 There's so many maggots per piece of cheese that you're gonna hear it a couple times and once you're done hearing the pitter-patter noise and the zip lock bag
 You're good to go. All the maggots are dead now. You just have to reach into a bag full of maggots
 Now you just have to stick your hand into a zip lock bag full of dead maggots to retrieve your price
 This is so disgusting and people love it over there. I actually watched it was really cool
 I watched two
 YouTube clips on it in between me watching hours of unpractical jokers for the past week
 I was able to watch two YouTube clips on this one was a Gordon Ramsay show. I guess called the f-word
 And where he sends people out he sends people out to eat disgusting food
 He he did it at the ending he had and they're like, yeah, it tastes really good. It didn't necessarily
 Tasted good. They said that it had a smoky type of spicy taste
 And the one guy says the aftertaste stays with you for hours and Gordon Ramsay goes
 You gotta told me that before I took a bite
 But you can get it. It's it's illegal. It's like black market food
 But you can't get it and the reason why it's illegal is because it's unhealthy to eat maggots
 Can you believe it? Can you believe what science is trying to tell us these days?
 Ah, I hate when politics gets into science
 Supposedly the egg heads back at NASA want to try to convince me that eating living maggots is harmful
 It actually causes something called myapsis
 my isis and
 It's where you can get you can get it anywhere in your body. They say normally it's accidental
 Sardinia normally it's accidental because of poor living conditions. You'll get maggots in your eyeball
 You'll look maggots in your ear. You'll get me eat maggots is the most likely one
 You're eating unsafe food and it could take a while like it's not like I'm it's not like you eat a magnet later
 The night you're like a Martha Martha. I don't feel so good. What's what's wrong? Well?
 Disgusting food we got from Italy and oh it could take six months because the maggot has to like go in there
 It hatches in you it starts laying more eggs
 It'll get in your intestines these bugs will get in you and I know it sounds like body horror
 It sounds disgusting, but it's true. They actually have different types of I should have done it
 She's an adventure. I mean I should have done an interactive adventure on this one
 They had these different forms of my isis you can get and most of them were just kind of boring or inconvenient
 I mean all of them led to your death
 They weren't treated, but I thought the creepiest one if you picked any number you get oral
 My isis and what that is is that's when you get a maggot in your body that hatches and then begins to spread and lay eggs
 And a little flying your butt. This is a hundred percent true oral my asses or oral oral not oral like you know hearing oral
 I'm so glad the season's
 Oral my asses I need a break you get these in you you can actually you'll be sitting there in your chair
 Martha's reading the newspaper and you'll be sitting there
 And you're like six months six months after you ate this disgusting food you'll feel crawling in your skin
 These wounds they will not heal by the way
 Wounds will not heal without medication or a kick-ass Lincoln Park song you feel crawling
 Inside your body because they're actually crawling in there. You'll be sitting there watching the prices right one night
 Martha did you hear that noise?
 Wow, what are you talking about this guy's hitting the buzzer and prices right no not that noise
 You'll hear them buzzing in your body that should
 In your body
 And you'll have a smelly discharge
 But I'm telling you if I'm feeling stuff crawling in my skin these wounds they will not heal
 Buzzing in my body this time that it's real. I don't care about the smelly discharge
 I would be like throwing that at people so if you've ever eaten
 Disgusting cheeses you've ever been to Sardinia or if you just happen to be having a conversation with someone in the street
 And you accidentally swallow a fly go to the hospital
 What if the doctor please and get it checked out you might be totally fine? It's not it doesn't happen every single time
 But if you do eat this cheese, there is a small chance. There is a maggot in your intestines
 waiting
 For its big break to be part of a Lincoln Park song Sam
 Let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We're leaving behind Sardinia the children can find their own way home
 We give them the keys for the dead rabbit run not let them take care of themselves
 They end up in a Lord of the fly situation. I will check in on them later, but take us out of Sardinia
 We are headed to New Mexico
 Last week we did a promo read for happily actually watch that movie. It's decent. It's decent. It's a good rental

 I
 Got it cut out now. Ah this haunted closet is so hot by the way Sam turn around this carbon helicopter
 Just hang a left or right whichever direction we're headed in we're headed to El Paso, Texas
 Let's get started because I'm gonna warn you right now. It's not the most coherent conspiracy theory
 Again another shocker a conspiracy theory. That's not coherent. We are in El Paso, Texas, and we're walking around downtown
 We're eating popsicles because it's so hot
 And then out of the corner
 Dracula jumps out. Oh, you thought it was daytime, didn't you?
 No, it was nighttime and then we're scared and samples out of steak and I was like bro
 Not yet, and then we hear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and we turn around and
 There is a giant slime
 Moving through the city and then
 Now that that that that that that that that that that that it's not techno music craft work hasn't entered the scene
 We see a giant man-eating plant with hands that have like little
 Plant things on them to go and snap snap snap snap snap
 And I'm like, oh my god
 This might be the end of Dead Rabbit radio
 We're surrounded by some of the worst cryptids the worst cryptids Dracula slime and a giant plant and then all of a sudden like a
 Power Rangers beam from the sky
 And we see three dudes just standing there. They all look at each other and
 They go, huh? They take power ranger poses and
 They go, don't worry guys. We got this
 We're Jewish and then they start karate chop and it's like a freeze frame guys back to karate chop a
 Slime Dracula's running in fear the plant is getting ripped in half
 Did you know according to the Reddit account anonymous tips X or his username now is deleted?
 But he used to be known as anonymous tips X. This is where we are
 The very beginning is where it already starts to lose cohesion
 either one Jewish people came from outer space all of them or
 Not that or not that they simply live in space from time to time
 Which would be pretty dope. I'm glad that I'm from earth, but if I could vacation in space, I'd be down to do that
 The and the Jewish people they have two missions in life
 one
 To protect us from gang stalking. Did you know this?
 Did you know that every single gang stalker and the entire Western hemisphere at least
 So if you're down in Chile, you're being stalked. There's all pockers. We're gonna look at you weird
 Oh
 Like what or if you're in Alaska and you're fishing your ice fishing and fish you're gonna look at you weird
 That fish that alpaca they were both from El Paso, Texas
 Every single gang stalker in the Western hemisphere is from El Paso, Texas if you think you are being gang stalked
 Look around for some Southwestern art
 You see Coco Pelle on a car driving by gang stalker. You see a man in a cowboy hat
 You're probably watching
 Dynasty or a rodeo or are herding cows right now, but those people are also gang stalkers. So that's good to know, right?
 It's good to know now anonymous tips X has actually crafted this map
 And it sucks because the images when he deleted the count the images are gone
 I'm gonna try to find a way to find them. I thought I had him saved on my computer
 I have I might have and if so I'll post it and I'll put it in the show notes
 I might actually take me a couple days or maybe someone can use the links. I tried going through internet archive
 We'll see what we can do, but let me try to give you a visual here. You're really not missing much
 It's basically just really bad Photoshop, but he has a map of America
 So we know that the gang stalkers come from El Paso, Texas and the Jewish people are here to protect us from gang stalk
 But I also got to let you know a little bit more about the United States
 Let's take a geography lesson according to anonymous tips X Oregon is the home of the second horsemen of the apocalypse
 Which looks like cloud from Final Fantasy? That's just
 That is the most sane one on here. That's what Oregon Oregon is the home of cloud from Final Fantasy
 According to this source according to our source
 California is currently overrun with white supremacists
 who
 Also is the bad guy from Resident Evil Nemesis
 They're actually you've ever been walking through California. You've seen a white supremacist
 maybe
 These are the identifying factors
 Is he 8 feet tall? Is he 8 feet tall?
 Does he have a giant glowing red ball in his chest to show his weak spot is one of his arms an organic blade if
 You if you've just seen a bunch of people walking around shouting white power. They're probably not white supremacist
 However, if they are a video game character in the shape of a bio weapon leave
 Go go away right now and they're all over California governor Gavin Newsom white supremacist
 Resident Evil Nemesis boss. You didn't know them Montana is the capital of hell
 Texas which is where we're at right now
 Texas is guarded so not everyone in Texas is this person Texas is guarded
 The whole state is guarded by leather face that makes the most sense out of all of this stuff
 Illinois is protected by a German
 Named I didn't know this guy was German. I mean I've never really watched these movies, but I don't think they ever went into his ethnicity
 I don't think they're ever like oh that character
 Illinois is protected by the
 Illinois is protected by the famous German Michael Myers from the Halloween series
 Like did I really watch those movies, but they're like ah, yes
 He's he has a sister and he broke out of insane
 And his mother's from Germany. Did they ever is that ever part of the origin story for Michael Myers?
 There's another famous germ this guy actually might be German based on his name
 But again, I don't think it was implicit in his origin story Ohio is protected by another German named the famous
 Freddie Kruger or Frederick Frederick Kruger was probably his original German name
 Frederick Kruger best origin story of any horror villain ever. I love his origin story
 His mother was assaulted by a thousand maniacs in an asylum and he was born from that act
 That's a perfect horror story origin
 But again, I don't think and they're like half of those inmates were German like I don't think that's part of his origin story
 New jersey not
 German new jersey is actually protected by a famous dutch man
 A famous dutch character first off who wants to be protected
 Who wants to be protected by freddy kruger for new jersey? It's the famous dutch
 Guy jason vorhees
 Very very famous. I knew he was dutch actually. I remember
 I was taking a class in dutch cinema history and they're like the famous dutch character ever was not dutch from predator
 It was dutch from it was the dutch man from brand 13. Everyone's all what?
 Neither of those characters are actually dutch
 Florida is protected by a which if I had to choose to live in any of these states
 Any of these states, right? None of those guys are protectors leather face not a protector
 Michael Myers freddy frederick kruger jason vorhees not a protector if you live in florida
 You're protected by blade dude. Wesley snipes blade. What first off he would wreck
 He would easily wreck all of those guys
 He might have a problem with freddy kruger because he's the most magical but dude blade versus leather face
 It's not even a contest leather face is just a fat dude with a chainsaw. I want to move to florida, dude
 I want to move to florida because blades watching over me
 Now this is a map of the united states, but canada is included. I know I have a lot of canada listeners
 We're not gonna leave you guys out canada
 Canada you're protected by a tiny guy with a knife
 I didn't recognize the photo
 I didn't recognize what it was from. They just show the entire country of canada
 There's a little like a gnome with a knife like a little goblin guy with a knife. So eat it canada
 We got blade in america. We have blade. It's official ladies and gentlemen. This is just the mind of anonymous tips x
 We're really just getting started here because the jewish people are not here to protect us from jason vorhees because luckily
 He's the protector if you happen to live in the state of illinois. Don't worry
 sleep easy
 A mass murderer with a machete is watching over you as you sleep
 But see the jewish people are here to protect us from gang stalkers if you ever have problem with gang stalkers
 Find someone who's jewish and say hey, dude
 I'm pretty sure that alpaca's following me and they'll turn and they'll look and they'll be like
 I got you covered
 And then you see me you're choking the alpaca out. Uh, let him go quit gang stalking this man. I'll let him go
 It says
 They're also here to protect us from cryptids and before I go any further I should
 Give you this little lifestyle tip before we continue here because I see this in my notes
 According to anonymous tips x you should eat three eggs a day. This is a public service announcement in the middle of his ramblings
 This is literally where he dropped it as well. You should eat three eggs a day
 but
 Only three eggs a day. You can't eat any more than three eggs a day
 his source for this information
 Famous video game you guys may remember this video game moment
 Avid video game players are going to be like, oh dude. I remember where I was at when I saw that cutscene
 In metal gear solid 4
 There's a scene
 Where they're frying eggs
 There's three eggs in the frying pan
 Moving on
 Moving on from metal gear solid 4 so we we have we're done with the public service announcement
 Let's continue on with the story the jewish people are here to protect us not only from gang stalkers
 but they're also here to protect us from cryptids and
 Little did you know you thought that you would just be able to go? Hey, you know, I'm jewish
 I can I go cry to chop Dracula a bitch upside head. No you idiot. It depends on where you are jewish
 Where you are jewish?
 Very complicated mythology we have here if you are jewish in algeria
 It is super specific jewish people in algeria
 They were sent here
 to fight giant scorpions
 uh jews in kyrgyzstan
 They're here to fight the winged tiger
 Which
 That's pretty dope right like both of those you're fighting giant scorpions
 You feel like jason and the argonauts the winged tiger is actually a cryptid that's supposed to exist in the takla moklin desert
 That's kind of a more dour existence
 You have your bar mitzvah. You're like, oh, this is dope, dude
 And then your parents realized sorry son
 You gotta go live in the desert for a while. You can't come back until you kill the winged tiger. Oh mom
 Jews in venezuela. They're the ones one in our beginning intro story. I didn't make those. I didn't make those cryptids
 I don't know where
 The jews in venezuela
 They are the ones that fight giant man-eating plants
 In the jungles of venezuela a giant man-eating plant it's it's so full it can barely move it already ate a bunch of dudes
 But out of the jungle
 There's a jewish guy hiding me on a tree and he walks up and he just
 Crotty chops this plant on the back of the neck doesn't have neck crotty chops him right on the stem
 I don't know if the implication is that if you're not jewish
 You can't fight these things because I think I could take on a man-eating plant
 I left the word giant out. I left the word giant out when I said that
 But I think I could do it fighting winged tigers fighting man-eating plants. This is dope jews in norway. What do they get to fight?
 They actually this is so bizarre
 This is even weirder than that stuff if you're jewish in norway you have to travel to laos
 Because apparently there's no cryptid in norway for the jewish people to fight you have to travel to laos and there
 You're like all right, dude. I'm not gonna fight like some float and demon head and we're gonna flight some like
 suck monster from the swamp
 jews in norway hunt pedophiles in laos
 Which is noble work. Don't get me wrong
 But if you knew
 That all your other jewish buddies were crotty chopping giant scarfians
 And you were just like arresting some 43 year old dude and be like i'm sorry man. I'm sorry. Don't tell my family
 You'd be a little disappointed again. You're doing good work. You're doing good work for the community for the world at large
 But your buddy your buddy just beat up a winged tiger
 jews in hawaii
 They get to fight churufe
 Which is a volcano monster
 that's
 both awesome and that's all that's that
 At that point you're like why i've been born in norway
 I can see myself fighting. I can see myself fighting a man eating plant. Maybe a giant man eating plant. I can see myself at least
 Maybe with the right equipment being able to take on a giant scorpion or a winged tiger
 How do you fight a volcano monster?
 Like
 If he has no organs you can't stab it
 You can't really push it anywhere the whole fight is you just like slowly
 Ambling away as you're getting closer and closer to the sea
 I guess the implication is if you're jewish in hawaii
 You have the ability to find a volcano monster. You can't be burned by heat. Maybe i don't know
 I'm not jewish. I'm not jewish on hawaii. If you're jewish in hawaii, let me know
 Jewish people in singapore was also one of the people who saved us in the beginning of the episode
 They fight giant slimes again. That's a very abstract
 Creature to fight but they can do it
 Jewish people in singapore are able to fight giant slimes. We're back in canada
 You have the tiny man with the knife protecting you jews in ontario canada to be specific
 They fight giant turtles
 So after what the last two groups fought giant slimes, which you know, they're slow moving but again
 No noticeable weakness volcano monsters. No noticeable weakness. I was like, oh, that's dope
 I can kill the giant turtle
 I mean sure it could just like bring its arms and legs and head into the shell and I just kind of waited out
 Or i'm just poking it with a little knife
 I'm paring a little knife from a little goblin guy. I could fight a giant turtle the jews in ontario canada. They have it pretty good
 I found out later on because they're I had to do additional research for this
 I found another image he posted when he says giant turtles. He's actually referencing the teenage mutant ninja turtles from the michael bay movie
 I'm sorry much. I'd rather fight a giant slime and a volcano monster at the same time than rafael
 Screw that so anyways canada is just not a good place to live according to this guy jews and chekelsavakia
 I'm gonna give you guys a second
 Can you guys guess what the jews and chekelsavakia fight?
 I don't know why i'm giving you
 I don't know why i'm giving you a second. I can give you an hour. You'll never figure it out the jews and chekelsavakia have one enemy
 The face on mars
 So, okay, let's bring this do I even have to break this down
 Do I even have to say it can't move it can't die
 It's just a structure and you have to go there now apparently again
 I don't know if the jewish people are hanging out in space every once in a while. They're from space
 Super unclear not like everything else is super elusive, but how do you kill the face on mars? They just stand there. They just erode it. They're just going
 Blowing on it they're like hey it's your turn you gotta come up and blow on the face
 For a hundred years eventually it'll be eroded away
 Jews these ones make sense jews and romania they fight dracula
 Jews in egypt they fight the mummy just the one not all of the mummies just the famous mummy those make sense
 Those make sense
 Frankenstein is also a target on this list. Uh jews have to fight frankenstein
 But for whatever reason i can't figure this out jews and ethiopia fight frankenstein
 I don't even think frankenstein knows why he's in ethiopia. Huh?
 What so so
 Used to be in european castle
 Now where am i just watching all these people walk around he's in the middle of a small town
 He's trying to figure out exactly. I got struck by lightning now here
 And then there's a jewish guy walking up behind him. What do you use to kill?
 He's the frankenstein is the easiest guy to kill. He's just stitched together body parts just give him a good push
 I guess fire is what makes him scared
 But i mean like a bullet to the brain can kill him and jewish people in india
 fight igor
 India has a population of about a billion over a billion people. I don't know how many people there are jewish
 But it's not none. It's not one. It's probably just probably like a couple thousand ten thousand jewish people in india
 Maybe more because the population is so large. They all beat up igor every single one of them shows up
 Every single day igor the assistant
 The hunched back assistant to dr. Frankenstein
 At least frankenstein can like try to hide in the jungle seven foot tall corpse trying to hide in the jungle
 igor is just a dude
 Getting the crap kicked out of him every single day in india
 By at least again, I don't have accurate numbers, but at least 10 000 people
 at the very end of this photo presentation that he presented on reddit
 It's just a picture of a fart green fart
 And I think that's the best way to sum up this whole story
 So that is the saga of anonymous tips x and that's really the start of
 our
 Band from youtube week this story. I've had it for a couple months. I really wanted to cover it. I thought it was so funny
 Just this bizarre rambling of this guy
 It's from the gangstalking subreddit the gangstalking subreddit has so much potential
 It's not as funny as I thought it was gonna be
 There was one guy he was talking about his reddit post was gangstalked by x
 Kids flying monkeys
 Not x kids not like they were abducted by professor xavier. He's gangstalked by his x by his kids
 And by flying monkeys. I was like dope dude flying monkeys. Like does this actually think fly does this guy?
 That's crippling mental illness actually see flying monkeys. Haha. That'll be hilarious
 No, there was no flying monkeys in it
 It would have been sucked to be gangstalked by your kids first off
 You would find out that your kids were from alpesto texas
 They're like, that's weird and then secondly, how would you get away from them? They're just always there. Are we there yet?
 Are you there yet? Are you there yet? They're calling you as you're driving to work? Ah
 But it's so funny because I wanted to cover this but when I do put stuff out on youtube
 It just attracts great people. I've gotten a lot of great listeners a lot of great friendships
 But all the weirdos youtube attracts all the weirdos as well think about it this way when you listen to the podcast
 It's like a nightclub. You kind of have to know where it's at. Someone shows you
 Tells you about it. There you go to the nightclub. But when you put it on youtube is like a city park
 Anyone can show up any search term could have someone just stumble across it
 This is one of those stories that's real fun to look at and kind of look at this guy's madness
 I knew if I put it on youtube
 I was just going to get inundated with a bunch of weirdos and a bunch of
 Normie tear conspiracy theories about some screenshot. They saw
 Regarding Jewish people or I saw watch this six hour documentary and it'll answer all
 I just want to talk about fun conspiracy. I first off I've researched all that stuff
 I may sound like I'm poo pooing it, but I've researched all those screenshots. I've watched those documentaries
 I've done that stuff. I've been doing conspiracy theory stuff for 20 years
 Can't we just have fun with these conspiracy theories? So I wanted to say I'm glad I saved this one
 I always figured the youtube channel was going to go down at some point and it is back up but I'm debating on
 What we're going to do in the future
 But this is a this is the type of story that I know that I could share with an audience
 And we could have a good laugh at it. So hope you guys enjoyed this story
 This is one that I've been sitting on for a long time and really hope I can get the graphics up at some point and share them with you
 But the next time someone does say, you know
 Jewish people blah blah blah blah blah you should turn to them and say, you know what?
 I'm thankful for my Jewish brothers and sisters
 If it wasn't for them Igor would rule India
 And just walk away just walk away have no response to anything else and
 I think we all need to give a little shout out to
 To Frederick Kruger. He is truly doing the Lord's work all of those monsters
 All of those monsters Frederick Kruger and Michael Myers. I always thought they were evil people
 See doesn't this story show that you may think someone is evil, but they're not
 Just because they carry a machete or a chainsaw
 Or have a huge body counts and have murdered people across multiple movies. They're not evil. They're the real heroes
 I think that's the moral of this story one
 Don't post everything on youtube two. Don't judge a book by its cover and three if you are ever
 ever
 Gangstalked
 Be prepared to take a trip to El Paso, Texas because if you want this terror to end
 You have to go
 To where it all began
