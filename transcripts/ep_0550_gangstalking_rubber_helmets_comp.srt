1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 A crazy man does crazy things.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 But is he crazy?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Or possessed?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at a way that you, you, dear listener, can stop from being gangsta.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 All you need is two bicycle helmets, a hot tub, a can of beer.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 You can't sleep on a mattress.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And stay away from tunnels. Maybe?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 We'll figure out what this means today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Charlotte Rene.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Charlotte Rene.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 She's doing a little bow.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Charlotte, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So Charlotte, I am going to pull out...

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You're totally in suspense. You're like, "Oh, what's he going to pull out?"

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'm going to pull out the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 We're going to take a nice, soft little journey.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Two, Shelby County, Tennessee.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Shelby has on her old, timey, steampunk aviator goggles. She doesn't need them.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We don't have them. We can see perfectly good, but she wants to be fashionable.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're headed out to Shelby County, Tennessee.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's July 3rd, 2019, one day before America's birthday.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And if you think about it, last time we got to see fireworks her 4th of July.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It's weird how much has changed in a little over a year.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 But, "Protection fireworks at the Durgible." Look out, look out.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Charlotte's having to do all these crazy maneuvers.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I don't know why they're shooting them the day before 4th of July.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But anyways, they're trying to shoot us down.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But she's an expert pilot. She lands us in Shelby County, Tennessee.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're specifically going to the Mid-South Urgent Center.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 That's on Houston Levy and McCon, or McCone, I don't know.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 But if you live in that area and you know how to pronounce the street,

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 you can actually visit this location. It's 8 p.m. at night.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I probably should have described what that was.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Those are the noises of empty glass vials rolling on the ground.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 [Singing]

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Rolling around.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And there are these two police officers.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And they're walking with their flashlights and they're shining them.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 She's a pitch black Shelby County, Tennessee sky.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 It's extra dark there. It's only 8 p.m.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I don't know if they needed flashlights.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 [Singing]

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Cops are walking. They see these vials rolling on the ground.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 So, it bends over and picks one up. Radio's in.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Roger, we uh...

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We found the source of the noise. The weird noise.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Appears to be an empty glass vial.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And they look over and they see another one.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 [Singing]

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I just like doing that sound effect.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 They are following a trail of empty glass vials.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And they follow this trail of glass vials.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And they show a man hunched over in the darkness.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It's 8 p.m. so it's actually quite light outside.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And where he's at, it's super dark.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They can see him hunched over.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 [Singing]

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Drops the vial.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 [Singing]

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Freeze! The officers say.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And the man turns around.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 He's glowing.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And they just arrest him.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 He's not a supernatural creature. He's just a guy.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 He's a guy wearing a shirt and a cap.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Or a cape. Maybe the news article left out the letter E.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 But it was most likely just a cap.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 His name is Kevin Giles.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And this is all alleged.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Kevin, don't sue me. Definitely don't come looking for me.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So what happened was at the Mid-South Urgent Center,

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 they do medical stuff.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And they have to constantly send stuff out to be tested.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So outside their facility, they have a little lock box.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And in it they're putting in vials.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 But see, the vials weren't empty.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 What these vials contained was human blood and urine.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Human urine. Not like dog piss.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It would still be gross, regardless of what creature it came from.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But I'll let you decide what's grosser. Blood or urine.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Let me give you all the information.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Because you can imagine just be like, "Oh, I'm full of both."

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 What happened was at the medical facility,

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 there's video footage of Kevin Giles

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 walking, skulking up to the box.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 He has this cape wrapped around his face.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He skulks up to the box and he breaks it open.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And he begins reaching his hand into the box.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And he's pulling out vials of human urine and human blood.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And he pops one open.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Glug glug glug glug glug glug.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 He's drinking them.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So now which one's grosser?

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 If you knew your best friend,

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 you have a poor choice in friends, by the way.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 If your best friend says, "You ever show often,

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I get a hankering for a little bit of human blood."

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 He'd probably be like, "Oh, okay, that's weird.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Listen to my chemical romance.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 That should have been my first guess."

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Second guess, he's always staring at my neck.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But whatever.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But if your best friend said, "Every show often,

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I get a little thirsty,

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I drink a little bit of good old human urine."

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Like, it's grosser, right?

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 The P is grosser.

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Drinking urine's grosser than drinking blood.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 But anyways, it didn't matter.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 This guy was drinking both.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 [laughs]

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He got busted for having a little bit of cocaine on him.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Probably in him as well,

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 if he's drinking urine and blood.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But the neighbors, no shock here.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The neighbors, when the news reporters went to go visit him,

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 most of this information came from WKRN,

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 local news center in Tennessee.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 The neighbors go, "Oh, that guy?

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Yeah, Kevin Giles.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Super weird."

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 The reporters like, "Yeah, we kind of figured that.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He was drinking blood and urine."

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Here's a quote from one of the neighbors

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 who didn't want to be identified.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Quote, "He didn't want to interact with anybody

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 in and out fast."

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Where's Sonic?

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Where was Sonic during this whole thing?

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 "In and out fast, and if you try to interact with him,

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you look like a deer caught in the headlights."

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Oh.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 The quote also continues,

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 "He was also speeding up and down the road."

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Which I imagine for a guy who drinks human blood and urine,

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 that's kind of the best situation for him,

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 is driving on the road and makes people pee their pants.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And then he's like, "Oh, he's marking down their address."

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 When he sees people like,

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 "Whew, that was a close one."

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And they're walking into their house.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 He's like, "I'll be seeing you tonight."

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And then he's ringing out.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He's ringing out underwear.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And if he hits them,

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 so in July 2019,

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 this is just how insane the world is,

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 in July 2019,

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 he's drinking human blood and urine.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And by October, he's free again.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So I don't know what type of penalties there should be

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 for drinking blood and urine.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I think there should be some, though.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You get arrested in July in October,

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 you're like, "Oh."

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I don't even know how long he was locked up.

162
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 He wasn't locked up for a couple of months,

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 but apparently, I don't think he happened the next day he got out,

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 but he had gotten out just a couple of months later,

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 or a couple of weeks later, who knows.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But in October, he was re-arrested

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 because he was driving like a madman down the street.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And he got in an accident,

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 and his seven-year-old son was sitting in the car,

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 and he got in the accident,

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and the seven-year-old son bumped his head.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I probably did a little more than bump his head.

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I think he...

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 (laughs)

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 He bumped his head into his head.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I don't think he had a little lump on his head

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and little cartoon birds were flowing around,

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 but he also wasn't horribly crippled.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So some were in between the two.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Somewhere in between Bugs Bunny getting hit with a mallet

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and being brain-dead for the rest of your life.

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That's where this kid was.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So he was re-arrested for that.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So it definitely has a driving issue.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He's like trying to drive the car.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He's like, "Where did I leave my blood?"

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He keeps checking his pants.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 "Dad, dad, no!"

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 "Oh, here it is. It's inside of me."

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 (blah)

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So we've had a lot of...

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 (laughs)

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 We've had a lot of laughs at Kevin Giles,

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 the urine drinker, blood drinker,

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 "crasher of cars."

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But there's a weird detail buried in this story.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Otherwise, just weird news crime story.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 The neighbor said that he used to be a seminary student.

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But he dropped out of school.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 "Seminary," if you don't know, is where you go

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 for religious studies,

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 generally to be like a minister or a deacon.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I don't know if deacons have to go,

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 but to be an ordained minister.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It's preferred that you go to seminary,

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 so you have a well-rounded view of the holy text

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 that you will be teaching.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He went to seminary and he dropped out.

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And now here he is years later drinking human blood and urine

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 and driving like crazy, which is different.

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Everyone drives like crazy.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Not everyone drinks blood and urine,

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 but I have to keep saying, driving crazy

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 is the number one producer of blood and urine

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 if you can't break into a lockbox.

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So I think they are combined in this case.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 What if, they put on our conspiracy caps here.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is fully allegedly conspiracy cap fully on

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 what if in the middle of his seminary studies,

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Kevin Giles was waylaid by a demonic force.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I've talked a lot on this show about my father used to be a minister.

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 One of the things he said a long time ago,

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 he said one of the things that he had observed

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 was you get these, and we've done it too.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 We've all done it too, because we're all into the paranormal.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He says one of the things he's observed

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 is every show often you get a young minister

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 who becomes obsessed with demonology.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because it is a very intriguing topic.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I mean, this whole podcast in a sense is based on that darkness,

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 that other darkness that's out there.

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He says every show often you get a young minister,

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 in seminary who would start researching demonology

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and become obsessed with demonology.

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 You would see this happen because you're researching it

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 because you have to know that if you're preaching the good word

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 you also have to know the bad word, right?

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 You have to know what the opposition is.

239
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 People would start to become obsessed with it.

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I'm wondering if that's what happened to this guy.

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 He was in seminary and he began to research demonology

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 and it became an obsession,

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 and then eventually it became a gateway.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 There's no better chess piece to take off the board

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 than a devout person.

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 That would be the best one when you can look and go,

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and this person, if they succeed in their quest to become a minister,

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 they can preach the word,

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 they can preach the way you're supposed to be.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 But if we can corrupt that person,

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 we can take that piece off the game board.

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That's a win for us.

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Possessing a taxi cab driver, I mean, that sucks, right?

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Especially for the taxi cab driver.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But, I mean, you might like become a serial killer

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 or just like overcharge people.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Again, a vast difference between the two.

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But if you possess like Billy Graham,

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 if you possess like a major religious figure

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 and spoke a corrupted version of the text,

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 that's a game changer.

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 So is that what happened to Kevin Giles?

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Was he a man who started looking a little too closely

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 into the darkest parts of religion?

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And then he let infernal forces take over his life?

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Or is he just a man who went--

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I guess the other one was just a guy

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 who went nuts and started drinking blood and urine,

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 which happens too.

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But I do think the fact that he used to be a seminary student

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 makes me lean more towards a man who,

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 if not possessed,

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 may simply be under the influence

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 of a dark demonic force

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 that wanted to take a playing piece

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 for the side of evil.

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So, Charlotte, let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter.

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I'm just kicking vials at the cops.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I'm like, "Hey, you guys, catch."

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 They're like, "Oh, that's evidence, man."

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Like, "Ah, he was only in jail for a couple weeks anyways."

282
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 The justice system sucks. I'm still kicking vials around.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Charlotte, bring in that carpenter copter.

284
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 We are headed out to a hot tub.

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 [imitates hot tub]

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Charlotte's like, "What?"

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 She's like looking all around.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 She's like, "There's a lot of hot tubs around."

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I was like, "Yeah, we're flying towards a particular one."

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 But first, this Halloween,

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 prepare yourself for the terrifying, suspense-thriller

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Spell, starring Omari Hardwick from the TV show Power

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 and Loretta Devine.

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Marquis, played by Omari Hardwick,

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 awakens from a plane crash and prisoned

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 by a mysterious woman practicing hoodoo magic.

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 He desperately tries to break free to save his family

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 from the sinister rituals that await.

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Spell is premiering at home on all digital platforms

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 October 30th, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I said yesterday how I watched the trailer for this movie,

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and it does look really good.

303
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 It reminds me of an episode of Tales from the Crypt.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It has a really cool vibe to it.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'm really looking forward to being able to check it out.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 So yeah, and you guys check it out as well.

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Check out the trailer. I'll put it in the show notes.

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Let me know what you guys think, but it does look pretty cool.

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 I was actually super stoked to be able to do this one.

310
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Charlotte, keep flying that carbonic.

311
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Have you found a hot tub yet?

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 She's like, "No, you're talking about a movie.

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I was paying attention to the movie read."

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You see a hot--it's that hot tub right there,

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 and we're flying.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 We see a hot tub in this guy's backyard,

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and we can't really see his face, one,

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 because we're 10,000 feet in the air,

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 but two, he's holding up a beer can.

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 You're like, "What?"

321
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'll explain.

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I'll explain as best as I can.

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So Charlotte, land this carbonic copter in this guy's backyard,

324
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 and he doesn't even acknowledge we're here.

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 He's still holding a beer can in front of his head.

326
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 A while back, Chris, long-time show supporter.

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 He's the founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade,

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 long-time supporter of the show.

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 He turned me on--that's a bad choice to wear.

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And he introduced me to the subreddit Gangstalking MKUltra.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They're not for just you regular gangstalkers out there.

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 They're not for you people who just think that the mailman's spying on you.

333
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 No, those people--those people are people that you could share a cab ride with,

334
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 and hopefully overpower the satanically possessed taxi cab driver.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 MKUltra gangstalking is way weirder,

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 to the point that I imagine if these guys went to the Gangstalking subreddit,

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 they would be told that they're nuts, because this is truly nuts.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 This is absolutely insane.

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 This is a Reddit post called Part 2.

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I don't know where Part 1 is, either, guys.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I looked all over for it. I looked all over for it.

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Part 2 exists. Part 1--it must have been taken down by the MKUltra.

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I don't know why they left Part 2 up,

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 because Part 2 explains how we can defeat Gangstalking.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 It was written by throwawayguy123xd,

346
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 who--again, I don't spend a ton of time on Reddit.

347
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I know we've known a lot of Reddit stories recently.

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 This guy has -6 karma, which I didn't even think was possible.

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And the fact that he's posting exclusively on Gangstalking MKUltra

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 shows that other people who believe they're being gangstalked, thanks.

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 This is nuts.

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So we're walking. We're gonna get in the hot tub.

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Did you guys bring your bathing suits? I did.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 You guys are like, "No, I didn't plan on--I'm listening to podcasts.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I'm not bringing a bathing suit."

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Here you can borrow mine.

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 We have official Dead Rabbit Radio board shorts.

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Where is Part 1? Nobody knows.

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Throwawayguy123xd, we're just gonna call him "throw" from now on,

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 is sitting in the hot tub.

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Here is what his steps are to 100% prevent you from being gangstalked.

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Step 1 is very easy.

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Write this down. This is very important.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 This is very important. This might save your life someday.

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 First off, you need to buy two bicycle helmets.

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Because the bicycle helmet--

367
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It's the bicycle helmet that has rubber on the inside?

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 That's a thing.

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 I'm taking this guy and his word that that exists.

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I don't think I've ever put on a bicycle helmet.

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Have I?

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I don't know why I looked over to my imaginary Jamie over there.

373
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Anyway, she has to get a bicycle helmet--two bicycle helmets with rubber on the inside.

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Now you wear one all day long.

375
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And that keeps the negative energy from the gangstalkers from permeating your head.

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Now, this is kind of an interesting one because when you see someone with a bicycle helmet,

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and you see him on a bicycle, you don't even think about it.

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 If you saw a guy with a bicycle helmet walking around a store,

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 you'd be like, "Oh, he must have just gotten off of his bike."

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 But if you go to a movie theater, sitting on the movie theater with a bicycle helmet,

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 you're going to be like, "Okay, first off, I shouldn't have followed this guy all around town."

382
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I almost feel like I'm gangstalking the guy, and he's like looking over his shoulder.

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Two, that just looks weird.

384
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 There are certain places where you can play the game of pick-up basketball in your bicycle helmet.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 People are going to be like, "Dude, seriously, take off the helmet."

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 You're like, "What? No way. It keeps out the negative energy."

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So wearing a bicycle helmet in weird places--you have the opera--

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 You can just keep naming places.

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 You're at your daughter's wedding.

390
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 You're like, "Oh, yes, I have my bicycle helmet on."

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 That's your whole toast.

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 The point is, is that you're going to get weird looks while you're wearing a bicycle helmet.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And then that's just going to make you think you're being even more gangstalked, right?

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But you're not getting their negative energy.

395
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 But the question you ask--it's a question that I ask, too--

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 To be--you know what? Actually, I forgot about this.

397
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So he posted--the subreddit is the post that's titled "Part 2."

398
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 The whole post is just a picture of this image with text written in it.

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He doesn't explain any of it in the comments.

400
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And I sent this JPEG to Chris and I go, "Hey, look at this."

401
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And he said, "I'm not clicking on that."

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Now listen, Chris. You're the one who sent me to this website in the first place.

403
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So I'm sending--he's like, "I don't even want to look at it."

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 "I don't even want to look at what you're sending me."

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 "Dude, you're the one who sent me to the subreddit."

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So if I send you a photo from that subreddit, you better look at it, bro.

407
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I had to absorb all this insanity myself.

408
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Let's get back to it.

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So why two bicycle helmets?

410
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Well, you have to discharge one and wear the other one.

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So it only absorbs so much negative energy in a given day

412
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and then you got to put on the other one.

413
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So now you have two bicycle helmets, but you just can't take the other bicycle helmet off

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 and set it on the ground.

415
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Well, that's part one.

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 You have to then cover that bicycle helmet in mud

417
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 because the mud discharges the negative energy.

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You see a guy wearing a bicycle helmet riding a bike.

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 You're not going to think anything of it.

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 You see a guy with a bicycle helmet in a grocery store, you're not going to think anything of it.

421
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 If you see a man with a mud-covered bicycle helmet,

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 it doesn't matter what situation he's in.

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He could be a bicycle helmet salesman.

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 You're going to stare.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 You're going to stare.

426
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He could be riding his bike with a bicycle helmet the way that the law intended,

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 but you are going to wonder why it is covered in mud.

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But you got to keep doing this.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 You got to wear a bicycle helmet every single day and cover mud.

430
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Now, he doesn't say, see, here's the interesting thing.

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 He doesn't say to not wash him, but he doesn't say to wash him.

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And when you're talking to crazy people, you have to be pretty specific

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 because you just keep layering mud on over and over again

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 until eventually there's a little trilobite fossils.

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 There's little fossilized worms at the very bottom edge of the helmet.

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 We don't know.

437
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He just tells us you cover one in mud.

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Wear the other one, but then I don't know.

439
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You never wash him.

440
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 You just got to keep covering him in mud.

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 That only shields your head.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But see, the way that the MK Ultra dudes, the bad guys,

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 which MK Ultra is a real thing.

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Okay, I'm not dismissing that there's a government plot that was working

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 on brainwashing and people and stuff like that.

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 This isn't real.

447
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 This is just going way too far.

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But anyways, he's saying that he's like, oh, he said it was real.

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You believe in me?

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I'm like, okay, for the sake of argument, I believe in you.

451
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 What else do you have to tell us?

452
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 He says that that only protects your head, though.

453
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 See, the beams, the negative energy can actually go through your jaw,

454
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 go through your nose, go through your neck, go through all sorts of stuff

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 and get into your brain.

456
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 It's not just you don't just have to protect the brain.

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You have to protect the whole upper body.

458
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Oh, great.

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That is why we're in a hot tub, because he says,

460
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 if you sit in a hot tub with your neck and your spine,

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 you have to have both of them.

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Don't just try putting your neck in the hot tub and exposing your spine.

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That will allow you to still get negative energy and drown, by the way.

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 If your neck is in the water, your spine is in the water.

465
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I don't know why.

466
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 See what I mean?

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Too much detail sometimes, not enough detail other times.

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You have to be underwater, both your spine and your neck.

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Don't be contortionist and just get your neck in there and think you'll be okay.

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You got to be wearing the helmet, too, by the way.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So your hot tub is going to be full of muddy water.

472
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 You're wearing your helmet, you're in a hot tub, up to your chin,

473
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 and then you have to take a beer can, a cold beer can,

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 and you have to put it in front of your face.

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So you're sitting there.

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 This is the rest of your life, by the way.

477
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I hope you have a really good pension planner.

478
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You have a trust fund, because to protect yourself from these horrible beams,

479
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 you got to sit in a hot tub, hold a beer.

480
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And the beer can, I don't know why beer can.

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I don't know why it can't be like a Coca-Cola or something like that.

482
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 But it covers your third eye, your temples.

483
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It doesn't.

484
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 That's the biggest beer.

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 That's like a Foster's beer can.

486
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 That's bigger than a Foster's.

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I've never had a beer can, then when I held up,

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 went from my temples, my chin to my third eye,

489
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 he's carrying around a keg everywhere.

490
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Stop staring at me!

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 His mud is dripping off of his helmet.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 If you hold it up, if you're in the hot tub,

493
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 you got the helmet on, you have the beer can.

494
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 You cover your third eye, your temples,

495
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 all of that stuff with this beer can.

496
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 That will actually, and the beams can't penetrate the water.

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 The second you get out of the water, mind you,

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 they're going to be right after you.

499
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 The gang stalkers are waiting for you.

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 They've hidden all your towels.

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 They're like, "Ha ha ha ha!

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Now you got to walk and be cold all the way to your house!"

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 You're like, "Ah!"

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Dripping mud everywhere.

505
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Did you know?

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Did you know?

507
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 This is actually a real common conspiracy theory,

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 because I've seen this a couple of things.

509
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 In your mattress, you have springs.

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Your mattress has springs.

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Bum bum bum bum.

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And springs are actually transmitters.

513
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 That coil is actually a way for the govern--

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 This is an old conspiracy theory.

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Old farmer was all in that conspiracy theory.

516
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 The coils in the bed are actually to create a basically

517
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 a giant transmitter or a giant receiver.

518
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So when stuff is being beamed down from satellites

519
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 or like cold war spies are shooting you with radio radiation,

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 your symptoms are worse in bed.

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Again, self-fulfilling prophecy.

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 If you're not getting a lot of sleep,

523
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 you're prone to having crazy thoughts.

524
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 But if you think the act of laying in bed

525
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 is causing you this distress,

526
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 you're not going to get as much sleep.

527
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So that's an old-timey conspiracy theory

528
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 that springs are actually used as a way to spy on you.

529
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It's like a listening device.

530
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It's an energy receiver, sender type of thing.

531
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He goes the extra step.

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He says that did you know this?

533
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That springs and coils are actually shaped after the human vagina.

534
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Now, I don't know who this dude's been banging, right?

535
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I am not in my wildest dreams or nightmares.

536
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Think how you can look at a coiled spring

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and imagine a vagina.

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Like, I that...

539
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 But he can.

540
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 He can, right?

541
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Which is the thing.

542
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 If that was the case, if your mattress was made out of nothing

543
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 but vagina-shaped objects,

544
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 you're not staying in the auto-bulter while you're staying in bed.

545
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Dudes are like, "Oh, I'm so tired."

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 They're like, "Dude, you just woke up five minutes ago."

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 He's like, "Oh, no, man, it took a bunch of minutes."

548
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 They're like, "We should have invented beds

549
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 to be shaped like something else."

550
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 They're not...

551
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 There is no way you can look at a coil and go,

552
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 "Oh, no, cover your eyes.

553
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You see, you're walking by a spring store.

554
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Do those exist?"

555
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 He believes that this is a conspiracy against him

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 that he has been, obviously,

557
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 but he's been trying to spread the word.

558
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He believes that mods of websites are actually

559
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 modulations or mind control.

560
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 They're actually, like, being controlled

561
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 and they are controlled themselves.

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Here's this quote, exact quote,

563
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 "My data has been deleted from Hacker News,

564
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Reddit, and 4chan.

565
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 My congressmen and newspaper and police won't talk to me."

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I would say most of that is true.

567
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Everyone's information gets deleted from 4chan

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 because it's anonymous.

569
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Reddit, you have negative six karma, bro.

570
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I don't know anything about Hacker News.

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 The congressman and the newspaper are not wanting to talk to him,

572
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 but I'm sure the police do.

573
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I'm sure the police aren't like,

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 "Oh, no, look at this crazy guy.

575
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Let's not pay attention to him.

576
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Let's totally just ignore him."

577
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I'm sure the police do want to talk to you, sir.

578
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 He tells us there's a couple different ways

579
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 to break this mind control.

580
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 You're taking notes, right?

581
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Because there will be a quiz.

582
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 There'll be a quiz when MK Ultra kicks down their door

583
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and they're like, "What?

584
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Where's your hot tub?"

585
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 You're not supposed to write the letter M anymore, okay?

586
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I mean, this is where we get--

587
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 the whole thing's insane, right?

588
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But this is where we get to just like,

589
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 there's different levels of insanity.

590
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Now we're not allowed to write that letter M anymore.

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You're supposed to just write an upside down V.

592
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And then I guess another one.

593
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 So, because otherwise it's just like a little triangle.

594
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So don't write the letter M anymore.

595
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Put it as two-- again, not super specific.

596
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 So just to be safe, if you're writing M's,

597
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 just one little upside down triangle.

598
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Also, do that in your cells.

599
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 It doesn't tell us how to do it.

600
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It just tells us that we need the letter M--

601
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 the letter M that's floating around in our cells.

602
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It needs to be an upside down V, guys.

603
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You didn't even know there was a letter M in your cells, did you?

604
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 But there is.

605
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Just keep thinking. Turn that into an upside down V.

606
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 The letter G?

607
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I'm not going to do the whole alphabet,

608
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 but I kind of wish you went through the whole alphabet.

609
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 You just had these two.

610
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So letter M, you write upside down as a V or something like that.

611
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I've already kind of forgotten.

612
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 So it's like, the letter G, did you know this?

613
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 The letter G has a hook,

614
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 because it's trying to hook our brains.

615
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That's it. There's no explanation for that.

616
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I'm so curious.

617
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I could honestly sit down and talk to this guy

618
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 over a nice cold beer and hot tub and go,

619
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "Wait a second. What is it? Why?

620
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Why is it trying to hook our brains? How does it hook our brains?

621
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Is there another way to say the letter G?

622
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 How are we going to talk about all the stuff that's G-related?"

623
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He says that the tunnels are real.

624
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 The tunnels are real. And like I said, it's this giant graphic.

625
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 This is a giant image that he has.

626
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I'll put it in the show notes obviously, but he goes,

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 "The tunnels are real. He has a picture of this old tunnel."

628
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It's actually like a less of a tunnel and more of like a giant pit.

629
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And he has this quote, "This is a real tunnel in Portugal."

630
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That may or may not be true, right?

631
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I'm going to assume that he did find a photo of a tunnel in Portugal.

632
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 But I don't know.

633
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "This is a real tunnel in Portugal surrounded by one million black people."

634
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 What does that even mean?

635
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 What is the point of that?

636
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 First, there's a lot again.

637
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 So many questions.

638
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 One, is there like a town nearby?

639
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 First off, I don't think, I think that would be a big town of a million people, but...

640
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Are they just hanging out there?

641
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Is it just like, "Hey man, what are you doing this weekend? What do we always do?

642
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 We're going to hang out that tunnel in Portugal."

643
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 There's a million of us. It's super awesome.

644
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Why are they there?

645
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Is there an infrastructure?

646
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Is there like roads and stuff?

647
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Or is it literally you go to the tunnel and then when you walk out of the tunnel, there's just a bunch of dudes standing there.

648
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 A million of them!

649
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I think they would show up on a satellite photo.

650
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 I think a million of anything.

651
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Except for like microbes and stuff like that.

652
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 A million little "M's" in your cells.

653
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 A million people are standing outside this tunnel.

654
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That's it. He doesn't say if it's good or it's bad.

655
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He doesn't say if they're like, "Hey, welcome, let's have a big party."

656
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 He just says that they are there.

657
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 We are going to finish it up with this.

658
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 He says that if you want to feel better, this goes with the hot tub thing and walking around with a muddy bicycle helmet.

659
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 If you want to feel better, you should stay outside.

660
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Like, "Okay, I've heard that before. You know, like vitamin D sunlight, working out, gets a blood pumping."

661
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 No! What? Are you crazy?

662
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 What does not what he means?

663
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Think about it. "House." The word "house."

664
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 "H-O." The first two letters.

665
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "U-C."

666
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Now, because "SE" apparently becomes the word "C."

667
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 So he's saying that it implies "U-C" or "C-U."

668
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And then "I-O" for input/output.

669
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Let me read you that sentence back exactly how he wrote it and see if you can make any more sense out of it.

670
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 "House." H-O-U-C implies "C-U-I-O" input/output.

671
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Where'd the "H" go?

672
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 The "H" just left. Jumped into your cells.

673
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 The "I" showed up. It's like, "Hey guys, what's going on?"

674
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 They're like, "Oh, we're in this guy's paranoid delusion."

675
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 He's like, "Ooh, can I join?" They're like, "Yeah, sure."

676
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 How do you get that? How do you get-- I get how you might be able to get H-O-U-C.

677
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I mean, it's still-- I mean, it's stretching it.

678
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 But where did the "I" come from?

679
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Anyways, by being in your house all the time, it's like an input/output thing, or they're seeing you, or you're seeing them, or--

680
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 He gives us this great analogy. It comes out of nowhere.

681
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 It's going to sound like I'm pointing it out of context. It comes out of nowhere.

682
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 If God was a hot model, and you made fun of her, she'd send bullies after you.

683
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I'm wondering, one, if this guy-- he'd just stalked a hot model at some point, and a bunch of bullies came after him, too.

684
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I don't think God is just chilling up there, and people are all making fun of him.

685
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 He's like, "Oh, we don't believe in you anymore. We're atheists," and he's up there, and he's like,

686
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 "Oh, man, if I was a hot model, I would totally know how to take care of those guys."

687
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 This infinite army of archangels that stand behind him, they're like,

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 "God, do you want us to do anything?" He's like, "No. No, I'm not a hot model, so I can't-- I mean, like, where is this coming from?"

689
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But just so you know, atheists out there, you may talk trash about God all you want.

690
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 But just so you know, if he was a hot model, you'd get beat up.

691
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Here, we end it with this. We end it with this.

692
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It's an uplifting message that this man tells us.

693
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Don't be scared. Don't get rid of your stuff.

694
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 How close do you live to the swamp?

695
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And then-- And then there's a picture of a bug, of a cockroach or something.

696
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 So there's a picture after he has that uplifting. I guess that's uplifting, right?

697
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And we talked about this guy previously last season, where he asked people,

698
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 "How close do you live to the swamp?" And I was puzzled then, but I'm even more confused now.

699
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I actually didn't know it was the same guy when I found this post. I was reading this and I was like, "Damn it, it's the swamp guy again."

700
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Don't be scared. Don't get rid of your stuff. How close do you live to the swamp?

701
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And then there's a picture of a bug, and on its antenna are Cheetos.

702
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So I don't-- I don't know, guys.

703
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I don't know. I don't know how close I live to the swamp. I don't know. I don't know what any of that means.

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 This is a look at insanity that's far beyond the normal gang stalking.

705
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 This is a guy who actually writing stuff out like a Reddit post is less effort than what this guy did.

706
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 He had to make this giant graphic, which he thought was super helpful.

707
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And if anything, it has driven me one step closer to insanity.

708
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Because now every time I see a G, I'm gonna think, "Hmm, so that-- that was that."

709
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 There's literally no way to wrap that up.

710
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 If you followed these, all of them turning your cells into little M's and sleeping on a non-spring mattress.

711
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Unless you like sleeping on a bunch of vaginas and who doesn't.

712
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 What if you did all this stuff? Let's put on our conspiracy counts here for a second.

713
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 What if you did all these things and your life became a thousand times better?

714
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Like you felt all that psychic energy, that weight that's always been laying on top of you.

715
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Like a snoring man on a vagina. You feel it lift off of you.

716
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Everything seems clearer now. Colors are brighter. And the darkness has faded to gray.

717
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 What would you do? Like if you took these steps and things got better?

718
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm not advising you to do it.

719
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Because you could be opening like the man in the first store. You could be opening the path from curious interest to agreeing with the paranoia.

720
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 However, the next time you're at your local neighborhood Walmart, pick up a couple bicycle helmets.

721
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Two for you and two for your friendly neighborhood podcast.

722
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Because who knows? We may be the insane ones.

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Laughing at a man who is finally decoded away to stop the gangstalkers assault.

724
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 All we need is a hot tub, can of beer, a couple bicycle helmets, and a way to balance two Cheetos on a cockroach's antennae.

725
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Who could have ever thought it would be so simple?

726
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
