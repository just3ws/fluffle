 breaking news out of San Francisco as US Marines make their way through the city trying to capture an
 Elusive target and then we take a look at the story of a babysitter who has a close encounter of the delicious kind
 And then we visit Ohio University
 Considered one of the most haunted colleges in America
 Are these hauntings caused by a past of suicides and murders or is it something even more?

 Really really helps out a lot. Thomas. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit dirgeable
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit command. We are headed out to the city of san francisco
 Came across the story the other day. I'm sure you guys saw it in the mainstream news
 Who am I kidding the mainstream news more like the mainstream lube
 Concerns that's what they should be called right? I got this from the real news
 The news that doesn't need to be prepared the news that has no sanitary conditions whatsoever real raw news
 It's may 3rd 2021 go go go go go go bunch of marines are running through the streets of san francisco
 There's a bunch of mucking taking place. We don't have time to stop that
 We don't have time to actually maintain law and order in the lawless city of san francisco. No
 We have one target in mind go go go. They're doing the hand signals game fingers are shooting them. They think they're from a rival gang
 Ah, the marines are making their way through the city of san francisco target
 house speaker nancy polosi
 She if you're part of the 95 percent of the world population who cares nothing about us politics
 She is currently the house speaker. That's why that's her name. She's the speaker of the house of representatives in the united states congress
 and she's wanted for
 unspecified crimes
 Apparently she's committed several crimes the article did not make it clear
 It went into great detail about who was in charge of this operation
 But did not really make clear to me what nancy polosi is being charged with but anyways the us marines that are still under the control
 of president trump
 Trump still president joe biden not president. He's at like a sound stage
 It's like a fake white house that's in the same location of the white house
 The sound stage is actually in the white house. So when you see his car is driving around
 He's just going to the sound stage. He's not actually going to the oval office
 this is the slightly lopsided office where he's at and
 The us marines are looking for house speaker nancy polosi. Go go go go go. She's like 78 by the way
 I don't know what he even said that a full platoon
 It's not like she's gonna go straight up tony montana and start like shooting them up with a bunch of cocaine or will she
 We'll find out the us marines are moving through the city. Go go go go go
 And they see her they actually plan to this operation. They waited till her husband was at work
 Because if there's one if you think there's gonna be complications taking down one 70 year old person
 You don't want to face two of them. So they wait till her husband's at work
 They see house speaker nancy polosi leaving her house the marines throw a bag over her head zip tie her throw her into a van
 Go go go. They told the marines have sent this entire operation
 They can't say any word other than go go go. They have to say three times in a row as this van is speeding away
 Duly elected house speaker nancy polosi is in the back of this van that's speeding out of the city of san francisco
 They take the bag off of her and they realize something
 Go go go one of the marines says and the other one goes go go go. It turns out
 That they did not nab nancy polosi. They nabbed
 a decoy
 This was a another woman a much younger woman
 Who was wearing a realistic
 realistic nancy polosi mask
 And also had like her passport her id
 Everything on her that detail didn't
 Have any sense but that detail specifically didn't make sense if she has a life like nancy polosi mask on
 What does she need her passport and her driver's license license for right?
 And if she has nancy polosi's passport and driver's license, what does the real nancy polosi have?
 Does she have the doppelganger?
 Does she have the person with like photos of the person without the mask on?
 Why would you give doesn't make sense? You wouldn't want your decoy to flee the country
 You wouldn't want to make sure they didn't have a passport anyways
 turns out that nancy polosi
 who
 Regularly works in washington dc all the time and is well known in san francisco where she was elected
 They can't find her. They can't find her even though she's on television all the time
 Very very well known schedule where this woman's at they can't find her
 And this is i wanted to read you this quote from this article because i just love this stuff. I just love this stuff quote
 us military assets have fudged a covert mission to apprehend house speaker nancy polosi
 Arresting instead a polosi doppelganger
 Donning a lifelike mask that mimicked every hideous detail of polosi's face
 Right down to the most deeply ingrained wrinkles
 unquote
 I don't think the marines put that in their interaction report. They're like like dear dear general
 We thought we got nancy polosi because no one would like this. She doesn't look that ugly
 Nancy polosi is an elderly woman. She's not so
 Yes, if I was describing if I held him a mask of nancy polosi, I wouldn't say
 Every hideous detail. She's an elderly woman. It's not just that nancy polosi
 Has a doppelganger with a mask, but it's a disgusting mask
 The author wants to let us know that this mask was super hideous
 But anyways, who am I? I'm not a real journalist the people at real raw news
 Know how to undercook the facts and give them to us raw. So who am I to judge?
 This isn't a beauty podcast. This isn't a special effects podcast
 And this definitely is not a real raw news podcast
 So semper fi gentlemen your mission in san francisco is halfway complete. You capture nancy polosi's
 face
 Thomas the dankenjun, let's go ahead and leave behind san francisco
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the jason jalopy. We are headed out to
 Fort Wayne, indiana
 Seeing a train drive a car is not something I thought we would ever see but here we are. Thomas the dankenjun is somehow making it work
 It's a long driver. Smelling is exhaust the whole time. We're like, uh, he's a coal burning engine. We're all passing out
 Eventually though, we're taking a fort Wayne, indiana hospital
 We are revived from carbon monoxide poisoning and it is time to start this story
 It's march 1993 and there's a young woman. Let's call her
 Let's call her nancy. Let's call her nancy. There's a young woman named nancy. She is babysitting a baby a little baby person
 Parents are gone. Nancy is taking care of this kid
 Rainstorm starts
 But she's an experienced babysitter the rain doesn't super scare her right. It's just something that happens from time to time
 But then the power goes out
 Rainstorm power outage. You're alone with the baby now things are getting a little nervous and the baby starts screaming
 She's trying to figure out what to do like this is a strange house where are the candles?
 Where's the flashlight got the screen don't want to trip on the baby. Where's the baby?
 While she's trying to figure that out a bright light shines from outside the house
 The entire house is illuminated now
 But it's not a comforting light. It's a mysterious spooky light. It shouldn't be there
 And then
 There's a knock at the door
 Nancy slowly turns her head. I don't know. He might have turned it super fast. That wasn't in the notes
 It didn't say how fast she turned her head Nancy ever so slowly looks towards the door
 She sees the doorknob turn
 Then the door opens
 And she sees
 in the darkness
 A four foot tall man
 He's purple
 Her eyes must have really adjusted at this point to determine that he's purple
 with a curved nose
 large ears
 And he stands there looking at her for a second
 Nancy is frozen
 Little man staring
 Nancy's staring
 And the little man runs into the house
 Passed Nancy passed the baby into the kitchen
 She sees the refrigerator door open up
 That one's also a haunted refrigerator door
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 They got it from Strange Magazine number 13 Strange Magazine has served us very well in the past as well
 So think about it docks.com has a really good
 Track record as far as legit stories in Strange Magazine 13 the one time we covered it
 We covered it twice one was I think a monster in a basement
 The other one was the puff balls that rock people's skin
 I'll try to find those two stories for the show notes. I'll try to put those episodes in the show notes
 But this is an interesting story for me
 Because it makes this is a Pepsi commercial, right? Like when when
 I'm pretty sure there is a I'll actually try to see if I can find on youtube
 I'm pretty sure there's a soda commercial with this same setup
 Or a Snickers commercial butterfingers or something like that. I know the Reese's pieces had the alien but this seems set up
 This story seems fake
 This story seems fake and that's why I want to cover it
 At what point
 Do we dismiss stuff out of hand? I'm not going to go on a huge tangent with this
 But at what point when you hear a UFO story or an alien story do you go? That's not true
 And this is an interesting one for me because on the one on a
 If you never if he had not walked in to get the soda
 It would just be a babysitter meets an alien story
 It would actually have been so mundane. I wouldn't have covered it
 Because we see stuff like this happen all the time the fact that it goes in and gets a soda doesn't say the brand of soda
 So it's not the best advertisement in the advertising the alien's hand is covering the soda the whole way. You're like, is that coke?
 Is that Pepsi? I don't know what to buy
 At what point do we dismiss alien stories or really any of these stories imagine a story
 Where a ghost walks into a house and turns to the camera and goes choice of a new generation
 You're like, what?
 What what is that ghost story have an advertisement in it at what point do we decide to dismiss these things?
 I'm not saying the story is fake. I'm saying I highly doubt that it's real
 Because it reminds me of a commercial and is that fair
 For me to say because her story. I mean, I would think that this young woman saw
 A commercial like this and then she dreamt about it or was imagining it
 But I am dismissing the story because it reminds me of a commercial
 I feel like
 The story is not true because it seems so ridiculous, but we've covered a lot of ridiculous stuff on this
 So, I mean the story is kind of meta for me
 The cassa blanca invasion is one of the most ridiculous alien stories. We've ever covered. I'll put that in the show notes
 But any reminder remind me of a commercial
 So I just want I want to include the story one because I think it's an interesting but two on that meta level at what point
 Do we decide this is too ridiculous for us to believe because in essence all
 Alien things all ghost stories all bigfoot stories are too ridiculous for 70 to 90 of the population to believe
 So I just think it's interesting when we come across stories. Otherwise, this is fairly legit
 It's from two sources that I've gotten good stuff from before
 I distrust this I can't even say I distrusted like again
 I'm in that weird mode, but I wanted to cover this because of that meta moment and for you guys to examine that as well
 At what point do you go? I don't believe that because it's too
 It's too wacky
 It's interesting because we do come across that even though at its core everything is wacky and it's possible
 That the story is so wacky that it is true
 It's super bizarre and I think it would be hoove aliens to do more wacky and weird stuff
 They really want to stay off people's radar the weirder they get like making people pancakes or having talking bears show up
 Which are both stories we've covered on this show the less likely people are to believe them
 So it actually makes sense of aliens did things that mimicked pop culture
 Like the next files episode where the men in black were jesse ventura and alex trebek
 Because they knew no one would believe that they were visited by jesse ventura and alex trebek
 The aliens actually plan to be that ridiculous
 Thomas the dinkage and let's raid this babysitter's fridge and take all the sodas. We're gonna leave her. We're gonna say goodbye to the baby
 Hopefully they'll be okay. Hopefully no more aliens show up, but it's really doesn't matter to us
 We have another story to cover. I'm gonna touch you the keys of the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind
 This little house in fort Wayne, indiana. We're headed out to afton's ohio
 We've actually been to ohio university before I covered it a long time ago on episode
 200 what was it episode
 276
 Because at ohio university part of the college campus used to be an insane asylum
 As the campus was they built the campus and then 70 years later
 They thought it'd be a great idea to build an insane asylum right next to it
 And not a good idea. Not a good idea, right? It's gonna definitely interfere with your grades if you're afraid some lunatics
 Going to break in at any moment
 Eventually the asylum was shut down and the campus absorbed it
 So the campus got bigger and now the asylum is some classrooms and some teachers offices
 But we covered the ridges in ohio university back on episode 276
 But I started looking at some other ghostly activity that brought me back to
 Ohio university that I wanted to take a look at with you guys. So we're now college students. We're walking around campus
 We got on our college clothes. Those are different the regular clothes. They're smarter
 We're walking around ohio university, which is the alma mater of not only richardine anderson a k a magyver
 But ed o'neill
 Everyone's favorite television dad no matter what generation you're in you have good memories of ed o'neill
 Richard Dean Anderson and ed o'neill we wave hi to them. They're like, dude, we don't go here anymore
 We graduated decades ago. We're like see you in class. They're like, what are you guys even talking about?
 We're gonna take a little tour of this supposedly haunted college
 So you have east green so it's divided up into sections. So first off, let's start off on the section
 Oh, and is east green. There's a place called wilson hall
 That's where we're going to be dormant with our buddies. I don't need Richard Dean Anderson
 They're like, dude, we don't go here anymore. We're like, let's be bunkmates. They're like, oh man, they're stuck in this story now
 We go to get our dorm room. It's room 428
 But it's boarded up
 We're like, what how are we supposed to get in here and the hall monitor or whatever they're called the
 chauffeur, what are those guys called the hall monitor?
 The floor dude the floor dude walks up and we're like a floor dude. He's like, dude, I'm called the din mother
 What are they called the people who run the dormitories the mayor? He goes, hey guys
 I know you guys supposed to be in room 428, but that one's actually even sealed off
 We don't let anyone in that room anymore and we go. What's what happened there? He goes, let me tell you a story
 Also, sorry for sorry for booking you in a room that doesn't exist anymore
 But let me tell you a story
 This room used to just be a normal dorm room and back in the 1970s. There was a student
 Let's just call him Barry. We don't have his name
 But he was in there
 Fun loving guy probably the description of him whatsoever. They just says a man in the 1970s
 So he could have been could have been anyone. It could have been Henry Kissinger. It could have been
 Ed O'Neill. We don't know probably wasn't either of them. They didn't die
 mysteriously room 428
 But a young man died in room 428 that was in the 1970s
 Everyone in Wilson Hall had heard this story and some people. Oh, did he commit suicide?
 Well, maybe was he murdered? No, they don't think he was murdered. He just died mysteriously and this story went around
 But people went in and out of this room through the semesters through the years other people use this room
 Didn't really have a problem with it
 But a couple years later there was a girl who had heard about these stories
 And heard about this guy who died mysteriously and she was really into
 Black magic astral projection talking to spirits stuff like that
 She's in that room and she goes, you know, this is perfect because since this guy died mysteriously here
 This would be a vortex for me to make my powers greater
 People are like, what are you talking about you weirdo? So she begins to talk about astral projection
 She's trying to harness the power of this room and then she dies
 Supposedly some say that she killed herself by slitting her own wrists
 Other people say well her wrists were slit
 But she didn't do it
 She was murdered not by an assailant well technically an assailant but not by a human assailant
 But the dark forces came after her
 She was brutally murdered
 Because she was pushing the limits of what a human should know what a human should be capable of when it comes to the world of the paranormal
 So now the room had an even darker reputation. You had two people who died there one mysterious circumstances the other one
 May or may not have committed suicide, but definitely was involved in some dark arts black magic things like that
 Time marches forward. This is a dorm room students are filtering in and out of the college
 People are still using the room
 But what they're starting to run into is that when students would come in they'd put down their keys or their coffee cup or whatever
 You had reports of things being thrown off of shelves smashing against walls smashing into the floor
 Doors would open and close by themselves
 Sometimes you'd be in the room all by yourself
 Sometimes you'd be in the room by yourself and you'd hear a loud shout which i'm not going to emulate that
 Just imagine this voice but way louder right in your ear
 And then on the door people said that they could see the outline of demonic faces in the woodgrain
 That is the one I call the most bs on anything because that could easily be what is it periabola
 Where you're just looking at patterns and you're seeing it wrong and stuff like that
 But everything else could definitely be possible when we talk about the world of paranormal even the faces appearing on the door
 But I couldn't find any photographs of that the 1970s people had cameras if this is something that was happening all the time
 It'd be easy to document. I'm not saying there's not photographs out there. I couldn't find any
 Eventually the university got so many reports of paranormal activity in the room. They just sealed the room off
 We've covered that before we've talked about another university this episode is going to be full of past episodes of the show notes
 We talked about another university before I don't remember where I think it was actually now that I remember it was in
 Athens, but it was a different university where they also had walled up a room
 There's a staircase that leads to nothing. It's walled in
 There's a lot of legends behind that and so we have this same thing you have this room this dorm room
 That is not accessible. I was actually watching a video by the post. I believe it's called
 It is a Ohio University newspaper. It's their journalism program
 And they were investigating it. I mean, they were kind of goofing on it as well
 But they showed the door the door does exist
 You can't enter it. So it actually is a real place that can't be entered. It's not an urban legend
 It's not like room 428 doesn't exist at all. Even to this day on campus. They hear these stories about this room
 this building is also
 apparently in the middle of a pentagram of
 Native American cemeteries. So some people think that's why Wilson Hall is haunted but looking into Ohio University. That's not all
 Jefferson Hall, which is another building on campus
 Has what's called the marble sound. This would be weird to pin down
 They say sometimes when you're walking around Jefferson Hall, you're on the top story
 It sounds like someone's dropping thousands of marbles on the roof. There's nobody up there
 If you go to Washington Hall
 There is an entire this is huge actually. There's an entire ghost
 There's an entire ghost basketball team
 A high school girls basketball team all of them. It's an entire girls basketball team haunts, washington hall
 The story goes
 There was a girls high school basketball team. They visited
 Campus, they're like, oh, this place is great. I can't wait to go to college here
 I'll probably be here forever and ever and ever
 I'll see that at the same time even the coach is all ever and ever and the tour guides like oh, that's creepy
 and then they died in a car accident on the way home
 And now instead of their ghost going back to their loved ones instead of their ghost inhabiting the places
 They grew up and no they're just all at washington hall a place they visited once
 Which means i'm never going to go to a sucky plan
 I'm never going to go visit a sewage treatment plant
 Well, all this place is kind of cool and then my ghost then I died like eight years later
 My ghost is floating around a sewage treatment plant. I'm like, oh it sucks
 So that's the backstory
 But this okay, so if you heard that backstory you're like, oh, that's kind of sad, but you know
 They're in washington washington hall first. There's no basketball court there. It's apparently like a dormitory
 So it's not like they're like, oh, we can always play b-ball and who would they play against they're playing against a bunch of demons
 They're trapped in washington hall these girls are trapped in this dormitory
 That whole backstory is created because sometimes when you're in washington hall you hear the sound of basketball dribbling
 So here's what i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell you what happened i'm telling you what happened
 Sometimes you can hear a basketball dribble in washington hall i'll give them that it probably is a phantom basketball dribbling
 I think the high school basketball team is made up because i actually heard several versions of this story one is
 You just hear the basketballs the second one is it was a men's basketball team an adult men's basketball team that was trapped there
 And then the story that I found was the most fascinating and sad
 Was the all high school girls visiting one single time and being trapped there
 So I think what happens is there and this is very common in ghost stories
 There is a singular ghost event that may happen once or twice
 It may happen on a regular occurrence and the backstory is made up and I actually think that leads us into the answer of 4 28
 Most likely the room is sealed off for one reason or another
 Apparently the official answer is it's not safe
 That could mean anything from asbestos black mold the foundation's giving out
 There's a bunch of nails the place is infested with cockroaches
 It could be all sorts of things now most of those would affect the rest of the school
 It's not like they just nail a door shut and they're like cockroaches you'll be in there forever
 Could also be that it wasn't safe because you got a couple students complaining about
 Doors opening and closing there could have been a paranormal thing there
 But I think the story is made up from the 70s about the younger those are probably made up
 They're probably
 Backtracked they probably have a story wise. Why can no one go in this room?
 Someone goes. Oh, it's just not safe and then people over the years have made up these myths
 And that's the most logical answer
 But I don't want to end with the most logical answer
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here because I found something really cool about this university
 That opens it up to a whole other
 set of theories
 This school
 Has one of the most powerful
 Particle accelerators on the planet that's capable of sending a particle up to 14 of the speed of light
 It's one of the most powerful on the planet
 It was opened in 1967 which predates
 The ghost story of wilson hall the man who died mysteriously
 So with our conspiracy caps on it would be interesting to think that this particle accelerator
 Which is used for all of these experiments
 What if it actually has opened a rift of some sort?
 and so we do have
 More ghost act because this by a lot of accounts. This is I've just covered the ghost in this particular like wilson hall
 Washington hall
 There's a ton of ghost stories in this college. It's considered one of the most haunted colleges in the united states
 It's one of the oldest colleges in the united states
 But what if this you have this normal ghost activity people walking up and downstairs stories being shoved this particle accelerator has actually opened up
 Some sort of gateway that allows this phenomenon to be more apparent
 To be so apparent it can actually be violent and actually kill people
 So that's an interesting way to look at it. You have science and the paranormal blending together
 The side effect of this particle accelerator is causing that but then I thought of something even crazier
 and
 And I am not I am not implying I'm not implying in any sort of legal sense
 That ohio university or the people who maintain the particle accelerator
 Or this is conspiracy cap fully on do not sue me
 What if the experiments of the particle accelerator is what killed those two kids?
 Somehow a little particle
 A little particle was flying around so fast and it went crazy
 Grabbed a little particle knife a little did a little particle Ted bunny. What if by some sort of fluke
 That particle accelerator killed the kid in 428
 You're like Jason
 That's not how particle accelerators work conspiracy cap fully on
 What if the particle accelerator killed the kid in 428 in the 70s? So after it was operated some guys are like let's do this
 Let's see what happens. Let's type in particle plus 14 speed of light plus
 Charles Manson like what are you doing? Don't type that in
 The thing starts up. What I'm saying is what if that's why the room is not safe
 It's like right in the right in the path
 Like people are disintegrating at 14 of the speed of light that young woman in there
 She really is trying to do black magic, but it's not working. She's trying to astrally project. It's not working
 And then one day she's sitting there. She's walking around the house and she feels something but doesn't feel it
 and she looks down
 and
 A particle
 A particle hit her wrists a particle like she was she was holding a bag
 She was holding a big piece of bread
 She was walking with a piece of bread and she had her hands out
 And the beam the little particle went and cut across both of her wrists and it cut it so deep that she dropped a baguette and
 She died and so it didn't look like they're like no one would ever kill themselves if they were about to eat a giant baguette
 What happened? What if the particle accelerator is the reason why this room is unsafe?
 It's probably more it's probably more likely my original theory the particle accelerator may have something to do with ghostly activity in the area
 but
 Since we're already going down that path. I thought what if the particle accelerator is actually killing people there
 So does this particle accelerator open up gateways to other worlds as a few particle?
 have
 A few particles gone rogue and murdered students
 Who knows we don't know right it could be neither of those it could just be a particle accelerator
 A bunch of kids telling ghost stories making stuff up
 But the answer to these stories lie locked away behind the door to 428
 Maybe the school's right. Maybe it's not safe to go in there, but you try your luck anyways
 You want to prove the existence of ghosts you want to disprove the new conspiracy theory about murderous particles
 So you are able to sneak in
 You're in there for a bit waiting for something to happen asking the spirits to show themselves
 It's been 20 30 minutes
 You know you should leave because eventually the school authorities are going to find out you're in there
 And as you go to reach for the doorknob
 You realize
 It's wet
 It's sticky
 And it's warm
 That's when you look down and you see your own blood
 dribbling off of your fingertips
 onto the stained carpet
 You thought you were going to prove the existence of ghosts and you were right
 You became part of the story
 For decades students will tell the tale of a ghost investigator who forced their way into room 428
 And by the time anyone realized they were in there, they had been dead for days
 Their ghost now wanders the campus
 Hoping no one else makes the same mistake of walking into room 428
