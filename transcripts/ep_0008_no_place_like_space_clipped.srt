00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 There's no place like space and the war between the resistance and the dark ones heats up today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, thanks for listening into another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. Episode 8, I think? Episode 8?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. It is Monday, so generally on the weekends you kind of get a little bit of weird news.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Oh, you know what actually? Unfortunately, I don't know how to say the young man's name.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I always called him Extension, XXXTACNCION. Anyways, he's a rapper. I'm a rap fan. I'm not a fan of his or that style of music, but he got shot today.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 20 years old, got shot. That's unfortunate. Now he wasn't the best guy in the world. That's not saying a lot, but he was currently in her investigation or something for beating up his pregnant girlfriend,

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 which puts him in a particular kind of scuminess, but yeah, it's always tragic to see anybody get murdered. This story is kind of developing right now.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 However, what makes this... it falls into the true crime category, because it's an unsolved murder. What puts this into kind of a conspiracy story is I just saw a picture that I'm going to call him Extension.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 That may not be correct, and I apologize for that, but I saw a photo that Extension on, I guess he was beefing with Drake, and I'm sure the photo will be available.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm not going to link to it, but it's a photo of Drake with his face covered in what appears to be semen, and the picture is cropped out right where it appears that Drake is giving oral sex to a man.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 This side note, I was trying to make my episodes not so explicit, but unfortunately this one probably will have the little explicit logo next to it.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So Extension had been beefing with Drake. He posted a photo of Drake blowing a guy, apparently, with a comb on his face.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I just saw that picture, I don't know if it's accurate, but anyways, they're saying that Drake had Extension killed. Oh, I hope not.

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I mean, it's tragic enough that he has murdered, and it's tragic enough that one or more other young men are going to prison for this, but hopefully his Louis Vuitton bag was stolen as well.

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I don't know, it's just sad. I get it that he beats pregnant women, and that's disgusting, and he needed to be held accountable for that and do his time for that.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But a 20-year-old man lost his life today, so that's sad. I think that's sad.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 But anyways, we'll see what comes of that story. Was Drake or his crew responsible? If so, this would be one of the highest profile rap killings.

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I mean, other rappers have been killed in the meantime, but as far as like two big rappers, it may be this generation's Biggie and Tupac, if again it's Drake.

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Again, I wasn't a huge fan of his music, but a lot of people were. I have a really good friend of mine who really likes him. He's kind of bummed out today that that happened.

20
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So, and a little bit happier news. I get it. A lot of people don't like Trump. I'm not a huge fan of what's going on in the border right now. Let me revisit. I'm not a fan of...

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I don't know how to fix the situation of the border with the children, but that aside. That aside, because I don't want to get too political on the show.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And I guess nowadays everything's political.

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 A couple months ago, Trump announced that he wanted to start a space force, and he was just doing it at some sort of ceremony for the military or some football game for the military.

24
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And it's funny as he goes completely off script, like he always does. You see a bunch of young men standing behind him in the uniforms.

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And they're there to receive an award or it's part of some military celebration, and then Trump just starts going on about the space force.

26
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And he go on and go on and eventually the young men in the back just to kind of start looking at each other, laughing. It's actually really funny to see. I'll find that video I posted in the links.

27
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And of course you're like, okay, that'd be kind of cool. Today it is official. The Pentagon is beginning to set up a US space force, a completely separate armed forces.

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 We'll now have six armed forces, Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard, and US Space Force. At its very least, we're going to have a space station with dudes flying around little robots that are moving stuff out of the way.

29
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 At the very most, we're going to have armed spacecraft flying through space. We're going to have basically X-Wing fighters. We're going to have little clam ships with little laser guns or little rockets.

30
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We're going to have all this amazing stuff. Now they may not be manned. They may be drone controlled, but guess what? They're going to be flying them from a space station.

31
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 This is not going to be on Earth. You're not going to be in sitting in some laboratory in Nevada flying these things. You're going to want to be up there flying around these little robots.

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I'd love it if people climbed minimum and flew around little spaceships. The great thing about this, other than the whole childlike joy of building fightercrafts in space, is that you're going to create a whole new organization whose sole purpose is the militarization and exploration of space.

33
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Every year, they're going to have to justify their budget. Every year, they're going to be pushing farther and farther out into space. We need $50 billion. Why?

34
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Because we've got to set up a base on the moon. If this is part of another organization on Earth, then they're always going to be like, "No, no, no. We want to do that, but we have to buy these tanks first."

35
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 You're going to have people, generals, who have to make sure that their budgets are there. They're going to push so hard, so hard to prove that they're worth the billions of dollars they get.

36
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 So they're going to do stuff. We're finally going to see people going back to the moon. We're finally going to see us spreading out.

37
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 What's going to happen, too, is that Russia and China and India, maybe even South Africa, a little African, I think we're going to end up in our lifetime seeing this huge Pan-Africa alliance.

38
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I think they'll also, they have so many rare earth minerals. I think the whole southern half of Africa could end up becoming some sort of Pan-African alliance, and you could see a real-life Wakanda type situation.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Some stuff has to happen before then, but I definitely see that happening in our lifetime. You're going to have these other world powers saying, "You know what? We need to get up there."

40
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And of course you have the problem is that if we're building fighters, Russia wants to build fighters, India wants to build fighters, Africa wants to build fighters, and all of that.

41
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 But I think the real thing is that we spread out, Russia spreads out, we spread out, China spreads out, we spread out, India spreads out, and they're going to start mining these asteroids.

42
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 We're going to start finally doing the things that we've talked about for the longest time.

43
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 People complain about us mind-stripping the planet and doing all these horrible things. We can do that in space.

44
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And what we're looking at right now, what we're looking at right now, are the same decisions and the same naysayers that was going on when people wanted to launch galleons across the Atlantic.

45
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 People are like, "You can't do that. It's totally not going to be worth it." We have these resources here and other people are saying, "Trust me, you're going to make quadruple your money if you invest in my ship."

46
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And people die and they're a war spot, but in the end the world is better off for it.

47
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Global trade, the discovery of the American continents by the Western world. Trade with China, opening up all of those borders by going both through sea and land routes.

48
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I mean, we have to explore, we have to explore. And I just find that absolutely amazing that we are going to have a space forces in our lifetime.

49
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 And I really hope that this gets other countries to do it and we all just start going out. We start going for those bases, going for those natural resources out there.

50
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 There was an article I read the other day. I'm going to pull it up here real quick. I didn't plan on talking about it, but I'm going to go ahead and throw it in because I've kind of segwayed off into that.

51
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm going to put this in the links. This was from the Metro news. The headline, "New asteroid gold rush could earn everyone on earth 75 billion pounds."

52
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Because it's a British magazine. They're saying that NASA estimates that the total value of asteroids out there could be up to 700 quintillion pound dollars equivalent to 75 billion pounds for each of us here on earth.

53
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And they're saying that by going out there, the rare, the minerals that take us so long to get here, the rare minerals that it takes us so long to get here, we can mine these asteroids.

54
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 It goes on to say that some have predicted that the mineral wealth is so vast it could destroy our world's economy.

55
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And then it talks about how some people may mine them and hoard them for themselves. But if every country has its own asteroid mining operation, and there's not a shortage of them,

56
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 so I mean this could be the post scarcity world we're talking about. This could be a point where we have so many resources, so many natural resources like this.

57
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I'm almost speechless. This could be the beginning of that. Now it's not easy, and there are going to have to be spending decisions made, obviously.

58
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 This money's not magical. It has to come from somewhere. But when you look at, we can spend our money on this, and X amount of people will have X amount of, you know, decent life for X amount of years.

59
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Or we can spend more money and life is going to be hard for a lot of people, but in the end it benefits everybody.

60
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 You know, these are decisions that we'll have to make, but I do think it's important to have people whose financial existence and their existence as a branch of the military is they have to show that we're getting some return from it,

61
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 that it is worth it, and I think that we'll get that through them pushing farther and farther into space.

62
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So, space forces. If you're allowed to sign up at 41, I would totally sign up. I remember watching Starship Troopers and I thought I would sign up for the military if I was fighting aliens.

63
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Not a huge fan of fighting people. And you know, that's not, well I'm not a huge fan of, you know, killing people, I guess I should say.

64
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But I did try to sign up after 9/11 and that didn't work out because I was too overweight. But I'm not anymore. I'm much slimmer now.

65
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So, space forces. And also wouldn't matter because I'd be in space how much I weighed. I don't think I would have to really run a mile because I would just float everywhere.

66
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Okay, that was such a rant. I forgot. What was the second topic?

67
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Oh yeah, okay, so we're gonna try to get this, we got about 7 minutes left here.

68
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 So we'll see what we can do on this now. Not gonna talk about John Gotti moving even though that sounds absolutely terrible.

69
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I feel kind of bad for John Travolta. He's had two huge bombs, but anyways maybe I'll talk about that later. Here's the thing.

70
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So I stumbled across this group. They're called the Resistance Movement. Now, they're not the Resistance Movement, the Political Resistance Movement.

71
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 The Resistance Against Trump. They're not the Resistance Movement from Star Wars movies, which is stupid.

72
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 But anyways, this, so this is on their website, PrepareForChange.net, and I'll post the link.

73
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Imagine this is your first, imagine you just stumbled across this website. No, no, better yet, imagine a friend that you really trust.

74
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You trust their judgment. You think, you know, this person has their stuff together, and they say, you know what, blank, you know what, dead rabbit listener.

75
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Check out this website, PrepareForChange.net, and you go to this website and there's a picture that says the new, new Atlantis, and you're like, okay.

76
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And this is what you, this is the first paragraph you read.

77
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 The main body of the Resistance Movement came to Earth from Planet X with the aid of teleportation chambers in December 1999.

78
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 They have settled down an underground bases that were emptied before in severe battles between the Dark Forces and the remnants of Agartha Kingdom and the so-called organization.

79
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The organization was a forerunner for the Resistance Movement and was a leading resisting force against the Dark Ones throughout the human history.

80
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Between 1975 and 1999, they had their main command center about 1,000 feet below the Underground Railway System of New York.

81
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 When the weakened forces of the organization were refreshed with members of the Resistance Movement, they renewed together many underground dwellings and moved their main command center to a new location.

82
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And the article goes on from there.

83
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So, there is, there is a pull, there is a draw to living in a sci-fi universe.

84
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 There is a draw to feel like there is a secret war going on, that the world's not aware of, that one day you are woken up to that secret war.

85
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You are one of the few people who have that sacred information that the rest of the sheeple don't understand, but you do.

86
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And you know that when the time comes, two things are going to happen.

87
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 One, you're going to know what's going on.

88
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You're going to know how to help the people close to you, and you're going to know how to help that cute girl that you've always had a crush on.

89
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 You're going to be able to save her life and she'll reward you.

90
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Secondly, you're going to know what your true purpose is.

91
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 You weren't born to be a college student in debt. You weren't born to be a tradesperson.

92
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 You weren't born to be barista or a clerk or unemployed.

93
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 You were born to be a member of the resistance.

94
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And I get that appeal.

95
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I think, I think that's just a natural thing in our world.

96
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Our world is fairly empty. We feel empty inside.

97
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Now I feel my emptiness through stuff like this, by doing the podcast.

98
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I find this very, very fun.

99
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And I feel it through writing and doing artistic stuff and theater and things like that.

100
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And I think everyone can fill it some way.

101
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 However, I think the easiest way to fill it is to daydream about stuff like this.

102
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Is there anything wrong with daydreaming? Not at all.

103
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 If it interferes with your normal life, yes.

104
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But just daydreaming and sitting around and thinking, you know, when the dark ones finally wage their final assault on this world.

105
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 The resistance movement, because I've been reading these articles and I've been putting stuff in the comments,

106
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 because I've been donating to them and buying their books.

107
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 They know me. They know Jason Carpenter. And I know what's going to happen.

108
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So once I start to see the signs, the mass arrests, when the evil ones, the dark ones finally make their big push to take back their planet.

109
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And the resistance and the organization and the Agartha Kingdom stand together.

110
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I will be the ones in the street standing there saying, "Stop, evildoer. I resist you."

111
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And I'll be a hero.

112
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But that's not the way the world works.

113
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I wish it was. It would be very exciting.

114
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 That's not the way it works.

115
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 It's too simple.

116
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Too simple even to think that the resistance movement came to Earth from Planet X with the AIDS of teleportation chambers in December 1999.

117
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And I think it's funny how specific that is.

118
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 You can always sell a lie with specifics. That's one of the first things you learn is your lying.

119
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Where'd you go? I went to the store.

120
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Where'd you buy bread?

121
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Versus where'd you go? I went to the store. I bought some bread.

122
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And they gave me the wrong change. You sell the lie with specifics.

123
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I don't think this is true at all. I think you've probably gathered that.

124
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I don't think anyone's teleporting from Planet X.

125
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And this whole article, there's a whole website. There's a ton and ton of page for this.

126
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 It looks like they're even running some scam for African children, which is disgusting.

127
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Anyways, I'll go on a little bit more if you need it. The resistance movement, again, this I think, sells it to the egos of the people who believe this.

128
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 So let's say that I, Jason Carpenter, am 41 years old. I'm a clerk.

129
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I'm not, which is all pretty much true. I'm not really doing anything in my life. I feel empty.

130
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And I come across this. The resistance movement consists of three concentric circles.

131
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 The inner circle has a few dozen members, which are leaders of the resistance.

132
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Only those with extraordinary skills and talents, and those that are willing to accept great responsibility, can qualify for those positions.

133
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Whoa, well, I have extraordinary skills. Sometimes I can remote view while I'm sleeping.

134
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And sometimes when I see someone look, get a look across their face, I can tell they're annoyed by what I'm saying.

135
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I'm an empath. So right there, that first part, it just builds the, oh, I, and of course, oh, I love, I'm definitely built for taking responsibility.

136
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I will be a leader in the resistance.

137
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Okay, or next part, the middle circle consists of hundreds of thousands of, and these are, these aren't, these are actually their grammar.

138
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's not me misreading it. The middle circle consists of hundreds of thousands of members with special gifts.

139
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Okay, so what type of special gifts do you think they're going to list here?

140
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 When I was reading this the first time, 20 minutes ago, it says special gifts, something in like remote viewing or ESP or pyrokinesis.

141
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 No, these are their special gifts.

142
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 With special gifts for planning, organization, technology, research and development, psychology, medicine, healing, spirituality, creativity, art, music, dot, dot, dot.

143
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So the middle circle, so this resistance movement has these leaders who have extraordinary skills and are willing to accept great responsibility,

144
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 which is funny because whenever you get on a plane, they always ask who do you feel responsible enough to open the door.

145
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And I can imagine these people being like, I'll do it. I am a leader in the resistance.

146
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But anyway, so then the second, the second tier is people who have special gifts for planning.

147
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Who doesn't have a special gift for planning?

148
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Like what makes one person a better planner than the other?

149
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But then it just kind of trails off medicine, healing, spirituality, the special gift and spirituality, whatever.

150
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 At least the first ones I can understand like you're a really good organizer, you're I guess really good planner, you know about technology, but creativity, art and music.

151
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It just is, why?

152
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Why?

153
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Basically you make it so broad that anyone can be part of the second circle.

154
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 How, and it goes on, I'll get to that in a second, I think, I don't know how much time I have left here, not a lot.

155
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So I'm going to go on to this last circle here real quick.

156
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 The outer circle are army forces.

157
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So then I'm like, oh yeah, I don't have a lot of special gifts with creativity, music or art.

158
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And I'm a terrible planner and I don't have the, I don't want great responsibility, so I can't be a leader.

159
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So the outer circle are army forces.

160
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 This is where the young guy who wears biker gloves and doesn't own a bike and dresses in all black with the trench coat.

161
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 This is, he's like, yeah, I'll be in the army forces.

162
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 That's me.

163
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 These are not soldiers as we know them on the surface, but experienced interplanetary fighters who do not fight only with blind force, but have reached a high level of spiritual development also.

164
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Their purpose is to liberate the surface of earth from the dark forces and to assist humanity in building a new civilization.

165
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Ugh, wrestling dark ones.

166
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Don't get my outfit dirty though, because I have to take it to the dry cleaner.

167
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 [sighs]

168
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Going back to what I said a couple episodes.

169
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Okay, this reads like fanfiction.

170
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 There's more stuff.

171
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I may go into it again.

172
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 This, to me, is more irritating than who shot John Lennon.

173
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Because who shot John Lennon?

174
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 He's asking you for money and I bought his book.

175
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But I'd been reading his website for years.

176
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 This one is, has the, right on the top, it has our donate button.

177
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 It's running some sort of charity for people in Maulai.

178
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Maulai.

179
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Has all these clickbaity ads on it.

180
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 This is a money making operation.

181
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 The who shot John Lennon is a guy who is tormented with what he seizes the truth.

182
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 This is a money making operation.

183
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 They're selling people a bill of goods.

184
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 The resistance doesn't exist.

185
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 The dark ones doesn't exist.

186
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 They don't exist.

187
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 All of this stuff is fake.

188
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And people are buying into it and you're selling people something because they have nothing else.

189
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They have that hole in them.

190
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And you're taking advantage of that.

191
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And that's what pisses me off.

192
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 That's what pisses me off the most about conspiracy theory stuff.

193
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 If you want to tell a story, tell a story.

194
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Don't sell a story.

195
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I'm Jason Carpenter and this is Dead Ravveration.

196
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:11,000
