1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
 The saga of Michael Minkin continues as we take a look at some testimonials of people

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,720
 who have worn his magical anti-alien hat, and then we take a look at his most dangerous

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,760
 claim yet, that autism is caused by alien experimentation on human beings.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:29,320
 But with one of his free hats, your severely autistic child can get into college today

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:41,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 great day too.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,040
 Finally got a Patreon setup, it's gonna be in the show notes, it's going to be on

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,080
 the website DeadRabbit.com, which is hilarious if you've never gone to that website.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,160
 Looks like an eighth grader just learned how to do HTML.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,080
 But there's links on there.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,040
 If you can't support through Patreon, totally fine.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,920
 Just help get the word out about the show.

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 We got flyers you can also print out at DeadRabbit.com.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
 Put them up around your school, put them up around your business.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
 Don't put them up in your workplace.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,520
 Do not put them up in your workplace cafeteria unless you work at like a cool workplace.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
 You work where a bunch of stuffy suit and ties work, they won't understand what we're

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
 all about.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
 Everything helps, everything helps.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,920
 Let's go ahead, actually you know what, before we move on to the first story, this is kind

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,960
 of a short story, but it's related, I'm not gonna rant about Transformers or anything

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
 like that.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,280
 I was reading on the Mysterious Universe website the other day, it was about mysterious

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
 disappearances in Oregon.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
 And I'm reading it and it's like, you know, recently there's been some people missing

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,120
 in Oregon and I started reading the first story and it was about this man, he was around

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,000
 my age, like in his early 40s, and he went missing in Oregon in the forest, like Williamet

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,640
 National Forest or whatever.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,440
 And they said that the last time he was seen was two hikers hiking in the opposite direction,

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,320
 saw him hiking towards them and he was just dressed casually like shorts and shirts and

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
 stuff like that.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,120
 And they pass each other and they said hi, they didn't know him, but you know just being

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,520
 polite and he's like, hey, and he just walks past him, it looked like he was in a hurry

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
 to go somewhere.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,480
 And I'm reading this story and I said, I am going to make a prediction right now, before

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,440
 I've even finished reading the story.

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,480
 One, everyone listed in the story that's missing is going to be men.

40
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,440
 Two, they're gonna be found, if they're found, they're going to be found just off the trail.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,560
 And there was, I think, three stories in that article and two of them were found off the

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,600
 trail or near the, like, where the trail would be and the third one's never been found.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,920
 And the article chalked it up to all the spooky stuff.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,880
 Now, yes, people go missing, the two that were found were dead, it wasn't just that

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,920
 they were sitting on a rock for five years, they had died.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,880
 They brought it up like this whole missing 411, is there some sort of mysterious thing

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 in the woods?

48
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,920
 No, here's my, and I don't want to name the guy's names because, I mean, obviously I

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,800
 can't name the article, you can check it out, but listen, I know what's, I have a, I shouldn't

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
 say I know what's going on here, open me to legal liability, I think I know what's going

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 on here.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,360
 They're, they're, they're banging dudes in the woods.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,760
 They're banging dudes and no, no, that's not why they're dying.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,920
 It's not that they're out there banging dudes and then they're just like, oh my god, and

55
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,840
 they just collapse and the other guy just walks away.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
 But that's why they're found slightly.

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,920
 They may be getting murdered, which would be terrifying, but they found one body and

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
 they're like, the article's like, mysteriously, his shirt was missing.

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
 He only had his shorts on.

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,320
 I'm thinking, yeah, he took it off because he's about to have gay sex.

61
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,400
 Like dudes in the woods by themselves in a hurry, a hundred yards off the trail where

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
 you shouldn't be, they're banging a dude.

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 They're banging a dude.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,880
 And I almost can be sure that the police, that's a theory with the police, but they're

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,440
 not going to tell this grieving mother, we think that your son was having a gay sex in

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
 public.

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,440
 We think that he was on Grindr and he met a guy.

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,880
 That's what my prediction is.

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,680
 And I think, I'm not saying again, everyone who's ever kidnapped by Bigfoot or everyone

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,120
 who fell off of a Corvass was engaging in gay sex, but I think when you have men who

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,400
 disappear slightly off the trail, it's because they're banging a dude.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,280
 Now it could be that the other guy murdered them, which makes it, you gotta catch the

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
 murderer, or it could just be that the other guy didn't show up for the meeting and then

74
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,960
 the dude died of a broken heart.

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 I don't know.

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
 I don't know.

77
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,840
 I don't know why they died, but I think a piece of the puzzle is they're trying to have gay

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
 sex.

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,560
 Patreon guys, I do have a Patreon account set up.

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,320
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story here.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,080
 Now our first story is a continuation from yesterday's story and I'm going to just go

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,200
 over it real briefly in case you missed yesterday's episode.

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,240
 There's a guy named Michael Minkin who has invented a hat and it's any hat stuffed with

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
 eight pieces of Velostat.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,040
 Velostat protects stuff from static electricity, electromagnetic charges, stuff like that.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,720
 You wear the hat, aliens can't mind control you.

87
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,720
 So he specifically makes these hats and gives them out for free to people who are being

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
 abducted by aliens.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,420
 There's more detail on yesterday's episode, but I think that's a good enough introduction

90
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,920
 if you had missed it yesterday.

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
 Today we're going to take a look at some people who have written into him to get free

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,880
 hats and then to update him on their situation.

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,520
 So let's take a look at some of these great testimonies here, some of these awesome testimonials.

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,880
 You have in New Jersey, the year is 2005, it's cold January day.

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,480
 There's a middle aged woman, we're going to call her Margaret.

96
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,840
 She's writing a letter, I guess people are, 2005, she's typing it on a computer.

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,680
 So she tells Michael, listen, I need your hat.

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,840
 I, now okay, before I go on with that joke.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,200
 There are very, very few good reasons to be kidnapped.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
 Very few.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 This is one of them.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,080
 This might be the only good reason to be kidnapped.

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 Here we go.

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,360
 Mr. Michael, Michael Minkin, I need one of your hats.

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,280
 Please, these aliens, they're abducting me.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,640
 It's horrible.

107
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,000
 The torture, they make me do unspeakable things.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,160
 They take me up and they put me behind the controls of a super advanced starship and

109
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,920
 they make me fly around the universe, make it stop.

110
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,040
 Why would you want to stop that?

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,920
 Why would you not want to learn how to fly a spaceship, a combat spaceship?

112
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,760
 So she also gets to shoot lasers and asteroids and stuff.

113
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,720
 She had been saying the aliens were abducting her and forcing her to learn how to fly these

114
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,440
 things because Michael Minkin goes on about this.

115
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,760
 He says that the aliens are creating hybrids that look and act just like humans, but they

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,160
 don't have all the human skills really.

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,720
 So the aliens force the abductees to teach hybrids how to be more human.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,960
 That's why in yesterday's episode, the woman was teaching the hybrids how to drive an SUV.

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,560
 Now when they say hybrids, we're talking about real humans here.

120
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,240
 They think they're alien, half-alien, so it gets real dangerous real quickly when you

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,920
 have that type of delusion.

122
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,360
 But Michael Minkin says the aliens are having the abductees teach hybrids how to drive cars.

123
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,240
 But the aliens are also teaching abductees how to fly spaceships all the time.

124
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,800
 So here's why.

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,000
 When the aliens came here to wage intergalactic war against us, they brought enough spaceships

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
 but not enough pilots.

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,480
 So now they have to abduct humans and teach them how to fly spaceships.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,200
 Now I am very anti-alien on this show and I'm always talking about beating them up.

129
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,280
 I love stories when aliens are just getting clobbered over the head.

130
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,320
 However, I will go on the record right now.

131
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,800
 I will turn against every single human on this planet if I have the chance to fly a spaceship

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,280
 during the intergalactic war.

133
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,880
 I will evaporate all 8 billion of you if I get to fly in a spaceship.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,880
 Actually I'm just lying because I'll learn how to fly a spaceship and then I'll use

135
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
 it against them.

136
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,000
 If aliens were abducting me and teaching me how to use a lightsaber, I would not complain.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,280
 Oh great, what are we going to learn today, the Force?

138
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,080
 Help me Michael, help me.

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,160
 So insanity, insanity.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,960
 It's insane not just because she thinks aliens are teaching her how to fly a spaceship,

141
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,480
 it's insane because she doesn't want to fly a spaceship.

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,640
 So she's nuts either way.

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,040
 We have a woman in Colorado who said one day she forgot to wear her hat, she got abducted

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,520
 and then 4 hybrids beat her up while 2 other hybrids watched.

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,360
 They use the term abducted quite liberally so I don't know if she was abducted into a

146
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,540
 spaceship and there just happened to be 6 riffraff guys standing there at the leather

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,840
 jackets and be like "yo it's that broad with no hat, rough her up" and they're like "ugh

148
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,800
 and the other 2 dudes are just smoking alien cigarettes" or abducted in the case that she

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
 was walking on the street and a street gang just happened to rough her up that day and

150
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,320
 they're like "yo it's that woman who is a woman and she lives in a bad neighborhood,

151
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
 take her out and beat her up and they're just smoking regular cigarettes" like I don't

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,040
 know if the term abducted just means so many things, it means just taken, kidnapped, which

153
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,000
 is bad or abducted.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
 But anyway she says that she wasn't wearing her hat that day, she got roughed up by the

155
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,520
 alien equivalent of the jets.

156
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,120
 And then we go on to this one, now these next 2 we're going to see a steep escalation.

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,320
 There was about 100 of these testimonies, most of them were "having bad dreams, aliens

158
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,600
 are getting me, I wear a hat, dreams go away" that was the bulk of these testimonies but

159
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,040
 I went through all of them to find these last 2 severe escalations to the stories we just

160
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 talked about.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,480
 It's Mississippi July 2015 so very very recently, I'm sure the police would still want to be

162
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
 investigating this.

163
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,920
 There was a dude who's being abducted by aliens all the time, in a cabin near the woods, he

164
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,200
 sits in there, "go away aliens get out of my head" puts his hat on, he's like "there

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,160
 it goes, aliens are gone, now I can watch Jeopardy" and there he's super smart all of

166
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,160
 a sudden, I tried out for Jeopardy, if I ever told you guys that story, I'm not going to

167
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,000
 tell it now, I don't have time but I'll mark it down on my board.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
 Anyways, I met Alex Trevec to go where is I going with, oh anyways so he's watching

169
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,920
 Jeopardy, this dude, let's call him Alex, imagine Alex Trevec for the rest of this

170
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,120
 story, he's wearing this hat, he was finally free of the intrusive thoughts the aliens

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
 were beaming into his head.

172
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,120
 But remember his house, his cabin, is near the woods and what would happen was every

173
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,160
 show often, he would hear people banging on the walls of his house, "bubububububoom,

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,640
 bubububububububoom" and it would wake him up, must be the hybrids.

175
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,280
 There's no other reason why someone would bang on the side of my house unless they were

176
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,760
 half alien, I know how to take care of half aliens.

177
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,760
 This happens multiple nights over the course of however long and then one night, "bububububum"

178
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,320
 someone's banging on the side of the house, Alex, Alex Trevec gets his rifle loaded up,

179
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,120
 that sounded more like a siphon, that sounded more like a transformer, gets his rifle loaded

180
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,080
 up, runs outside and opens fire into the darkness.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,960
 Now he says he can hear hybrids moving in the tree line and he just begins shooting.

182
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,880
 "Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft"

183
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,200
 This is the quote from Michael regarding this incident, this is from his website.

184
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,520
 The hybrids left after the gun was fired and never returned.

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,840
 As of 2019 he still wears his helmet and is no longer harassed by aliens.

186
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,560
 They didn't return because I am willing to bet there is one or more bodies of human

187
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,200
 beings decaying in those woods, if not if he for whatever miracle didn't hit one of

188
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,240
 these guys, most likely kids pulling pranks because he never saw them.

189
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,160
 He's wearing a hat, he hears a banging on his wall, he goes outside, he shoots into

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,100
 the darkness and that's it, they never come back, either they are dead or there's a bunch

191
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,120
 of kids fooling the local weirdo and they're like "Oh that joke stopped being funny the

192
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,400
 second he came out of the house with the loaded gun."

193
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,920
 So that is basically, Michael loves it when people shoot these aliens, these hybrids.

194
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,920
 Michael does recommend that alien abductees carry guns with them so they can shoot alien

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
 hybrids.

196
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,520
 Again, humans, they look and they act like humans, Michael thinks that if an alien hybrid

197
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,400
 is going to get you, you can shoot them in the face.

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,020
 They'll blow them away.

199
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,220
 So again, super dangerous ideology here.

200
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,180
 Let's go ahead and move on to the last testimonial though I want to highlight here.

201
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,140
 It's a year later, now it's 2016, we're in Virginia.

202
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,540
 A woman living in a remote farmhouse.

203
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,560
 Now she had been wearing her hat for a while, she actually wears it all day long.

204
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,220
 Maybe she takes it off to bathe, who knows, hopefully.

205
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,920
 Imagine that hair, but anyways, she had, I guess it's the least of the worries where

206
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,260
 this story is going.

207
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,360
 Her messed up bed head.

208
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,200
 She wears the hat all the time, it has helped her from being abducted by aliens, but the

209
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
 aliens still want her.

210
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,360
 Now what's been going on is the aliens have been implanting, you know what, I'm going

211
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
 to back up here.

212
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,920
 So I want you to imagine you are sitting at work or school, wherever there is a common

213
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
 area where people gather.

214
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,780
 You're sitting there enjoying your beverage of choice, reading the newspaper, listening

215
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,420
 to music, whatever.

216
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,540
 And a woman walks up to you and sits down, is this seat taken?

217
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
 Can I take this seat?

218
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,100
 And she just sits down, she doesn't wait for a response.

219
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,620
 She just stares at you until you put the newspaper down, pull your headphones out and she goes,

220
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,500
 "Okay, good, glad you have your attention.

221
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,180
 I'm going to tell you something.

222
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,180
 I'm going to tell you a story."

223
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,300
 You're like, "Well, I was reading several stories in the newspaper, but sure, obviously

224
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,180
 if you're going to be rude and take up my time, you can tell me a story."

225
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
 She's like, "Good.

226
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,640
 You can't detect sarcasm at all."

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,680
 She goes, "I'm sitting at home.

228
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
 First off, let me tell you about my awesome hat."

229
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,080
 She's wearing a leather aviator cap and she tells you all about Michael Minkin and you're

230
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,400
 like, "Oh, yeah, you're looking for an escape route."

231
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,200
 But now two people have sat next to you and they're both hearing impaired, so they can't

232
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 hear any of it.

233
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,000
 They can't chime in, but they're so big you can't move out of where you're sitting.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
 So now you're totally stuck and there's a bunch of snakes on the floor, so you can't

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 crawl under the table.

236
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,300
 So despite all of that discomfort, she's sitting there, she looks at you and she goes, "Okay,

237
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
 here's what happened.

238
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
 I told you about the aviator cap.

239
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,540
 You can get one too, but the reason why I had to get this cap, this is what I told Michael

240
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,420
 Minkin when I needed this cap.

241
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,900
 The aliens have been putting hybrid fetuses into my body.

242
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,820
 I can feel them shift in my womb, just moving around.

243
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:56,960
 I had four of them in me at a single time, giant tadpole-like creatures oozing around.

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,800
 She starts making disgusting noises looking right at you.

245
00:14:59,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 It's one thing when it's just over a microphone, but if she's looking right at you going, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

246
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:15,560
 It's one thing when it's just over a microphone, but if she's looking right at you going, "It's

247
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,460
 a little more repulsive."

248
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,860
 Which I'm pretty sure is a lot.

249
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,860
 It doesn't sound like a lot, but I think most vitamins are measured in like milligrams,

250
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
 but maybe I'm wrong.

251
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
 Maybe I'm wrong on that.

252
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,520
 Anyways, so she takes a gram of vitamin C a day and one by one the alien fetuses would

253
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,540
 just start to die and rot in her body.

254
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,660
 I don't know how she got them out.

255
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,900
 I really don't want to know that detail.

256
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:43,020
 And then once an alien, she woke up and an alien was pulling a dead alien fetus out of

257
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,580
 her and putting a live one in.

258
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,740
 She's like, "Ah, I need to go get some emergency tomorrow.

259
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,040
 Got to double up on my vitamin C."

260
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,880
 So what happened was she ended up getting the hat.

261
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,620
 And so now the aliens can no longer put in this tadpole baby stuff.

262
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,560
 They could put in these hybrids.

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,020
 And she goes, "Now since I've gotten the hat, no hybrid babies in me.

264
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,700
 My womb is empty.

265
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,220
 It's clean as the day it was born when I was.

266
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,540
 The same day, obviously."

267
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
 And she winks.

268
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
 She goes, "You want to see it?"

269
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
 And you're like, "No, I don't.

270
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 I don't."

271
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
 She's like, "Okay, I just offer.

272
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
 I have to offer."

273
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,660
 She goes, "She says, 'So I got this hat.'

274
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,960
 Now what happened was one night I was sitting there watching my favorite television show,

275
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 Jeopardy.

276
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,720
 And an alien hybrid is walking through my house and it grabs my hat and it tries to

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 rip it off.

278
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,840
 But luckily I had it strapped to my head.

279
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,440
 So the alien from this advanced race, eons beyond her own, can't undo a strap.

280
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
 Dagnabbit!

281
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,920
 And then leaves.

282
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,240
 So now I know the aliens really, really want my hat, but they can't get my hat.

283
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,860
 So one day they sent in alien hybrids.

284
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,500
 Now a hybrid looks and acts just like a human, indistinguishable from a human.

285
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
 But I can tell they're an alien.

286
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
 You can go, "Wow."

287
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,240
 And she goes, "I don't know.

288
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 I don't know.

289
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,980
 I just have a feeling this alien hybrid was in my house and I knew they were going to

290
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,500
 try to get my hat.

291
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,460
 So I grabbed my shotgun and I shot him and splattered the walls with blood."

292
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,020
 The hybrid ran away.

293
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,680
 Now at this point you are like, "I'm fine with the snakes you duck under."

294
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,800
 You take off, you grab a couple snakes so you can have lunch later and you make your

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,360
 way out of your sitting room.

296
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,560
 Now a normal person having heard that story would say, "You shot a man," is what you're

297
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
 saying.

298
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 You shot a human being.

299
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,760
 Like there's evidence, right?

300
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,840
 You shot a human in your house, there's blood on your walls and you probably should contact

301
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 the police.

302
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 Because either this person was breaking into your house and threatening your life and you

303
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,980
 shot them out of self-defense or somebody was in your house, a nephew or an uncle or

304
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,740
 the mailman or whatever and you shot him.

305
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:05,180
 Michael Minkin goes on to say that, "Samples of the blood cannot be sent for analysis because

306
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,660
 she can't take a sample."

307
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,880
 So he's still under the impression that this crazy woman actually shot an alien and if

308
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,140
 she could somehow cut the drywall off of her house, she can then send it to a lab, they

309
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,240
 would do a study on it, prove hybrids existed and then everyone would want one of his stupid

310
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
 hats.

311
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,480
 She shot a man, is what the story is actually saying.

312
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,560
 Somebody was in her house, she shot him and he took off.

313
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
 Insane.

314
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,920
 Absolutely insane to teach people that some aliens are part human and it is okay to shoot

315
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,680
 them because they're not human.

316
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,800
 But let's get into what I think honestly is his most dangerous theory, really.

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,420
 And I want to reiterate too, this is all from a recommendation from Gary.

318
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,380
 Yesterday I mentioned Gary, he recommended the episode, all of this stuff also is connected

319
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,180
 to that so again thanks Gary, he got a two-parter out of it.

320
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:00,020
 He believes this, that autism is created by the aliens messing up in their scientific

321
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
 experimentations.

322
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,260
 He actually uses the Peter Principle to describe it.

323
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,100
 Peter Principle is this thing that people will be promoted to their highest level of

324
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
 incompetence.

325
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,440
 You can have a really, really good salesman and he is a mediocre manager and he's a terrible

326
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,880
 store manager and then he gets fired.

327
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,360
 And that's the Peter Principle.

328
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,700
 You always get promoted to your highest level of incompetence, of something you keep getting

329
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,320
 promoted until you get to a level where you can't do the job and they fire you.

330
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,560
 So he uses that to explain bad science among aliens.

331
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
 He goes, "Well you know the Peter Principle."

332
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
 He goes, "These aliens, you get these alien scientists.

333
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,580
 Keep getting promoted through the scientific ranks."

334
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,500
 This guy actually, and I should have said this yesterday, but Michael Menken is a technical

335
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,700
 writer and he's worked for Boeing and he's worked for all of these high-tech companies.

336
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,700
 As a technical writer, he's not designing spaceships but he's not an idiot.

337
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,140
 His beliefs are bizarre but he's not like a low IQ idiot is what I should say.

338
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,820
 You can have smart people who believe in really, really, really stupid things but anyway so

339
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,860
 he says that that's the same thing.

340
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,160
 The aliens are not good scientists basically.

341
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,440
 Some of the aliens suck at their jobs.

342
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,520
 So when they're trying to create hybrids, what they're doing is they're abducting people.

343
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,200
 Not everyone remembers they've been abducted, you see.

344
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,100
 They're abducting people, doing scientific experimentation on their embryos.

345
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,480
 Some of them straight up butterfingers it and can't get it right.

346
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,260
 So when that woman gives birth, her baby has autism.

347
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:38,120
 So a child with autism is a result of bad alien experimentation.

348
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,520
 If not a hybrid themself, he was really, really, really kind of sketchy on that because hybrids

349
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
 are the bad guys.

350
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,560
 He didn't come out and say everyone with autism is half alien.

351
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,360
 He didn't say that but he did say that they are a result of bad genetic experimentation.

352
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
 But why would they be experimenting on a human if they weren't creating a hybrid?

353
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,180
 See he doesn't really cross that gap there.

354
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,660
 But anyways, he goes and it's funny because conspiracy theorists, they go to war every

355
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,700
 once in a while but a lot of times they agree in their lunacy.

356
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,340
 People who believe we didn't land on the moon can be swayed over to the side that flat earth

357
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,540
 is real.

358
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,380
 Because the moon doesn't exist, we never landed on it, that's an easy thing.

359
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,580
 But people who believe in aliens and reptilians and all that stuff, they can't believe in

360
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,780
 flat earth.

361
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,660
 So those two groups are kind of…

362
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,960
 You'll have people in the middle who believe reptilians and aliens are demons, they believe

363
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,160
 in flat earth, but people who straight up believe in intergalactic civilizations, they

364
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
 cannot believe in flat earth.

365
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,120
 Every show often conspiracy theories just become incompatible in their stupid theories.

366
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,040
 So you go, when I'm reading this I'm thinking, I wonder if he's going to address the autism

367
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
 and the vaccine thing.

368
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,800
 Because that's a huge conspiracy theory and he does in a very, very interesting way.

369
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,000
 He really crafts his mythology really well.

370
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,820
 Now that I think about it, he's almost like an evil genius as far as that goes.

371
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,060
 Because he's really put some thought into this.

372
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,340
 This is… he has all these flowcharts.

373
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,140
 He's a technical writer, he has all these flowcharts on his website.

374
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,100
 So step one, aliens abduct people.

375
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
 As they do.

376
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,940
 Step two, they make successful hybrids, which is their plan.

377
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,980
 They want to create a race of half human half aliens to take over the planet.

378
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,260
 Completely integrate in society, become president, become prime minister, become your local grocer.

379
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,000
 Eventually they're in all positions of power.

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,880
 They tell you what to do, they tell you where to sleep, they tell you how to bag your groceries.

381
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
 You have no control over your life.

382
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
 Or they've actually worked in their flubbing of the human genome into their plan.

383
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,200
 Or if they cannot get control of the planet through the hybrids.

384
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 This is their secret plan they accidentally stumbled upon because they suck at their job.

385
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,500
 The genetic anomalies they create can sometimes create immune disorders or digestion disorders.

386
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,060
 So if you have celiac disease, you may be a hybrid, according to this guy.

387
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:03,280
 Also their experimentation has led to an increase in down syndrome and it's created an epidemic

388
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,820
 of autism.

389
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,260
 So you're not only trying to take over the human race, but you're also making other

390
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,020
 people who aren't hybrids weaker.

391
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,240
 So now you're basically weakening a good chunk of the human race, you're strengthening your

392
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,560
 alien hybrid army, and then he even has a subset underneath that.

393
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
 Very very fascinating.

394
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
 This is very very interesting.

395
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
 It's all stupid.

396
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,360
 None of it makes sense, but I thought this was an interesting fake.

397
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,000
 He had to address the vaccine.

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,760
 So he says, "Alien experimentation is causing an epidemic of autism."

399
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,840
 It's not, it's not.

400
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,440
 But anyways we'll go, we'll say that more people have autism today than have ever had

401
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,040
 autism before.

402
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,300
 He says it's creating an epidemic of that.

403
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,300
 Now the aliens have a third phase of their plan.

404
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,020
 Aliens cause people to have a hysteria over autism.

405
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,660
 Aliens then blamed it on vaccines so people don't get vaccinated and the diseases will

406
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
 come back.

407
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,100
 So now they have a three front war.

408
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,780
 Alien human hybrids in the highest positions of power, taking a good chunk of humanity and

409
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:16,640
 giving them digestion issues or Down syndrome or autism, using their failures at experimentation

410
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,560
 as basically weakening a good part of the population and making people afraid to vaccinate

411
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,400
 their children so mumps and measles come back and kill off millions.

412
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,800
 I'm impressed by his, I'm impressed that he was able to construct this narrative.

413
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,160
 Like that actually is something you would see in a fictional novel about a conspiracy

414
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 theory.

415
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,420
 That is something that you could see in a sci-fi novel.

416
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,780
 From a craftsman point I think that is a well put together conspiracy theory.

417
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,620
 As a moral human being it is disgusting.

418
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,020
 It's absolutely a disgusting theory because you're basically, you can go on and on about

419
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,820
 9/11 was an inside job and stuff like that and it is disrespectful to the people who died

420
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,020
 and the people who lost their lives trying to save people and all that stuff.

421
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,200
 But when you start to say your child is born, your child has a developmental problem because

422
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,640
 an alien stuck a needle in you.

423
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,440
 And the thing is that we've got, this is the second day we've spent on the guy.

424
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,080
 People believe in what he has to say.

425
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,760
 But see and then Michael says sometimes the plans have backfired on the aliens.

426
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,560
 Here's a quote from his website.

427
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,920
 From some abductee reports we can assume that the aliens are unaware that their creations,

428
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,820
 the alien human hybrids, may also be autistic.

429
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,500
 An abductee reported that when she was taken on board an alien spacecraft.

430
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,820
 She remember seeing an alien human hybrid flapping his hands just as her autistic son

431
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
 does.

432
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,900
 Now, of course I had to go on YouTube and type in autistic hand flapping.

433
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
 It apparently is really a thing.

434
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,740
 I can understand aliens being bad scientists but I can't imagine them being such a bad

435
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,000
 scientist that they don't notice that their superweapons are autistic.

436
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,760
 There's two key elements to that.

437
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,120
 One is that she saw it, she saw this alien doing this thing, doing this movement.

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,440
 But two, you have a woman who believes aliens cause autism and she has an autistic son.

439
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,720
 Which is why I think this is dangerous.

440
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,320
 I think she stumbled across this because she was looking for real information about her

441
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,920
 son's condition.

442
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,840
 She stumbles across this.

443
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,460
 Now he doesn't stop there.

444
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,500
 He doesn't stop by just saying you're kids autistic because aliens.

445
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,540
 Cause space age aliens have come down and done stuff to your uterus.

446
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
 He doesn't just say that.

447
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,660
 He says I have a cure for it.

448
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,860
 I can cure your child's autism by wearing a hat.

449
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,380
 See, he's also his hats which he still gives out for free.

450
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,500
 I think he's gonna start selling them eventually but these hats at least.

451
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,340
 It's the exact same hat but it's called the Nuro hat.

452
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,960
 And he said that it can help people like this one woman fell out of a moving car, she got

453
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,040
 a traumatic brain injury, she was hat on and her brain works fine now.

454
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,800
 He's billing it as a medical device.

455
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,560
 First it was, hey look it stops aliens from getting in your brain.

456
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
 Wait, that's made up.

457
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,960
 Let me make up something else.

458
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,600
 So now this is at as a medical device.

459
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,080
 I'm gonna read this to you.

460
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,000
 He talks about this story all over the place.

461
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,200
 I've read this story multiple times across all of his websites.

462
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,360
 Okay.

463
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,660
 So this is the power of the Nuro hat.

464
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,980
 "The hat dramatically improved the condition of two autistic children who wore it every

465
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,100
 night for 10 years.

466
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,780
 Both children were declared hopelessly autistic in the year 2000."

467
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
 Is that a term?

468
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,580
 Do the doctor go, "Doctor I'm afraid my son might have autism."

469
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,580
 The doctor's like, "Not only does he have autism, he's hopelessly autistic."

470
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,060
 I don't know if that is an actual term.

471
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,640
 I don't know if...

472
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
 You know there's like fat, obese and morbidly obese.

473
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,080
 I don't think there's autism.

474
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
 Severe autism and then hopeless autism.

475
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,360
 Doctors like just give up.

476
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
 Just give up.

477
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,120
 They want the sandwich cut into four pieces, cut into four pieces.

478
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,040
 It's hopeless, but he calls them hopeless.

479
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,880
 He does call them hopeless autistics and of course for the...

480
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 And now it's done again.

481
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,600
 Now I can just remember that bouncing soul song, "Hopeless Romantics" going through

482
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 my head.

483
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,080
 I'm just a hopeless romantic.

484
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,480
 So he says that.

485
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,180
 What happened was these kids wear these hats for ten years, right?

486
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,420
 Put the hats on.

487
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,580
 And because they wore these hats every day for ten years, these kids who were hopelessly

488
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,060
 autistic, both of those kids ended up attending college.

489
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,820
 They had those hats on and it cured them of their autism.

490
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,940
 Enough at least so they're no longer hopeless.

491
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,260
 They've just been downgraded to autistic.

492
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,860
 Now the story goes on though.

493
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,860
 That's not it.

494
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,320
 "Their cousins also tried the hat for less than a year and had some results, but the

495
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,120
 mother did not persevere and the children stopped wearing the hats."

496
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,400
 So you're at fault woman because you didn't wear his hats.

497
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,800
 The reason why your kids are still hopelessly autistic is because of you.

498
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,740
 If you had worn my hats, they'd be attending college right now.

499
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,400
 He goes on to say that parents have to teach the kids to wear the hats all the time, otherwise

500
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,560
 they won't work.

501
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,640
 When you're dealing with someone who's hopelessly autistic, I think trying to get them into any

502
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,220
 routine is difficult, let alone wearing no leather aviator cap full of packaging material.

503
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,860
 But that's not all.

504
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,460
 Because like I said, this is a wonder drug.

505
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
 This is a medical device.

506
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,500
 He finally finishes up his work with kids, thankfully, with this quote.

507
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,180
 "The hat also helped a mute autistic girl to speak in 2003."

508
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,180
 What is it?

509
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,180
 Animated?

510
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
 It's like door to the Explorer.

511
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
 It's like the backpack.

512
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,900
 Anyways, he goes on to say, "The hat also helped a mute autistic girl speak in 2003 after wearing

513
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,120
 the hat for three months.

514
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,400
 She started to speak."

515
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,120
 I'm going to guess her first words were, "Take this stupid hat off of my head, please."

516
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,200
 And then she just says, "Mute again."

517
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,560
 There are wacko theories.

518
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
 There are dangerous theories.

519
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,080
 There are people who put things out that the world is flat.

520
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
 Katy Perry's a saint worshiper.

521
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
 All sorts of nonsense.

522
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,280
 And then there are conspiracy theories that actively interfere with the way we live our

523
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,360
 lives.

524
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,260
 For someone who has a loved one who is autistic, telling them that the reason they're that

525
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,940
 way is because of the aliens' three-pronged plan to take over the planet doesn't help.

526
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,960
 At least I'm not an anti-vax person, but at least the anti-vax thing is saying there

527
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,080
 is a way to prevent this.

528
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,020
 Don't take the vaccine.

529
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,100
 But anyways, this is, you can't stop it.

530
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,540
 The aliens are going to give your kid autism and there's no control you have over it.

531
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,860
 And as a parent, that is the worst feeling.

532
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,160
 It's very, very sickening conspiracy theory.

533
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,520
 Quack medical devices are ridiculous.

534
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,200
 Telling someone their child can be cured or at least their autism be reduced.

535
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,640
 Wearing this hat every single day for 10 or more years is just the height of manipulation.

536
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,080
 But in wrapped up in all those theories telling people that there are alien hybrids out there,

537
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:10,440
 that you can shoot to protect yourself, to protect your species, is just dangerously poor

538
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,900
 judgment.

539
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:18,220
 Because in essence what you have told someone, that their autistic child may only be half

540
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,980
 yours, part of them could be the bloodline of an alien race determined to destroy our

541
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,340
 planet.

542
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,380
 And if they aren't human, they don't deserve to live.

543
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,780
 That may be your quote unquote "child", but it's really just a hybrid.

544
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:58,960
 And you know what you're supposed to do when you see a hybrid.

545
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:16,000
 That's it.

546
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,160
 Bye.

547
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:32,160
