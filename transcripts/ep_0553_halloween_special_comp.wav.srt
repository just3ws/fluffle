1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 A gruesome deer is spotted walking through the woods.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:13,480
 A young girl on the way to her grandmother's house runs into a big bad...something.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:21,480
 And then we travel to London to meet three roommates who have a toilet problem.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,160
 Their drains are clogged and they have been for several days now.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,960
 They think that's simply an inconvenience, but when the plumber shows up, the true terror

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:44,360
 starts today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,840
 This is our Halloween special that I totally forgot was the last episode before Halloween.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,320
 I had something else planned for today and I said no, you're good stories.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,160
 You're going to be next week.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,560
 But today I wanted to talk about some extra spooky stuff.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
 But first off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, MrTwister.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,680
 Everyone clap and do the twist at the same time while you're clapping for MrTwister.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,120
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this spooky episode.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,200
 Just help get the word out about the show.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,760
 Really really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,400
 So MrTwister, go ahead, chop off your head.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,640
 Don't actually do that, but for the sake of the story, chop off your own head and put

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,160
 on a fiery jack-o'-lantern as a new knob.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
 Put on that cape.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,080
 If you haven't already done those things, right?

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,640
 He may already have a pumpkin for a head, I don't know.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,840
 And let's put you behind the wheel of the Jason Jalopy.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,720
 First off, we're headed out to Illinois.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 Cars driving.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,000
 We're laughing the whole way.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,440
 We're listening to just the whole road trip is just one of those CDs of scary sound effects

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
 you get in the dollar store.

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,600
 So we get to Illinois and it's September 2020.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
 So the story's super recent.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,640
 We're out in the middle of the woods and we meet Chris Evans.

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
 You're like, "Oh, Chris Evans already.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 Can't wait to get his autograph."

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,240
 And I was like, "No, not that Chris Evans.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
 Actually, it might be.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 But I don't think so.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,800
 This Chris Evans is a hunter.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,840
 Chris Evans hunts this land and he has all these trail cams set up.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
 He's like, "There's nothing I like better than to watch something live before I shoot

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,660
 it in the neck."

45
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,080
 So I have these trail cams set up so I can enjoy their final moments.

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,320
 Now that I think about that, if that's what a crazy serial killer would do, like put up

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,480
 cameras all around someone's house and then just like watch you walk around for a couple

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,520
 months, check out your mating habits, wear you poop.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
 And I watch that for a while and then I break it and kill you.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,360
 And yes, I know that's the plot of a movie.

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,120
 I'm not going to give away what the movie is because I still want people to watch it.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,040
 But that is a plot of a movie.

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,200
 However, this guy basically just realized that these hunters are basically serial killers

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
 but they're killing animals.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,040
 You're like, "Jason, you just realized that?"

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,200
 Yeah, but I mean like, even if they're hunting them for meat, which are trophies, oh my god,

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,160
 they are serial killers.

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,640
 They're like, "I keep a trophy of all of my kills.

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,160
 Look at this wall of heads."

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,800
 I never, whoa dude.

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,560
 Anyways, anyways.

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,400
 Now I'm giving Chris Evans a bit of a side eye.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'm like, "Hmm, he has a necklace made out of thumb bones.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,040
 I'm like, I don't know animals have thumbs."

65
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
 He's like, "Ugh."

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
 He takes it in with shirt.

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,840
 Chris Evans has his trail cam set up and he sees this buck walk by one day.

68
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,720
 I was like, "Okay, that's cool.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 New deer.

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,680
 Let them get used to the train.

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,960
 Let them learn the ins and outs before I hunt them."

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,480
 Because it turns out the most dangerous game is me, when I'm hunting you and killing you.

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
 It's all well and good.

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,960
 But then comes October 17th, 2020.

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
 There's this video.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 You can watch it online.

77
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,680
 This story is actually really short, except for that insanely long introduction.

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,200
 So this segment is really short.

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 There's a video.

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 You can watch it online.

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
 It's on YouTube.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
 I don't know how long it's going to be on YouTube.

83
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,400
 But Chris Evans posted it and basically he is saying, "I have to go kill this thing now."

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,240
 And this has been posted to a bunch of hunting blogs and then it's spread into the world

85
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,560
 of high strangeness because it's so weird.

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,880
 And other hunters are like, "Yeah, we need to take this thing out."

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
 There's a video.

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
 It's maybe like a minute or two long.

89
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,200
 It'll be in the show notes if you really want to ruin your lunch of this deer, of buck,

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 the deer.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,240
 And it's set up per--I mean, like as a horror movie, it's set up perfectly.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,680
 You see this deer walk into frame.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
 Totally normal snout, right?

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,280
 Like most deer is totally normal head, a little head, little antlers.

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:52,000
 And as it gets further into the frame, it's, I would say about 50% of its back is missing.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,160
 There's just exposed organs.

97
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,680
 You see from the shoulder blade basically to the butt hole, the deer has been ripped

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
 open.

99
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 And it's just walking.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,080
 It's so bizarre because on the one hand it looks so fake because it's so gory, but on

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,640
 the other hand you can actually see the shoulder blade move and the skin flap open.

102
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,600
 You could literally put your hand into it.

103
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,400
 Don't do that, right?

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
 This thing's suffering.

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,040
 But when it moves, it's so gross, dude.

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 When it moves its shoulder, it opens up like a hot pocket.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,880
 And you can actually see inside of it, even if it's not moving its shoulder.

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,920
 Even if it's just laying on the ground, you can see its back is missing.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,400
 And I'm not talking like a little sunburn.

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,520
 You can see the organs and the spine and stuff like that.

111
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 Super gross, right?

112
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 Super gross.

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
 You're like, "Ding it, Jason!

114
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,120
 I was just eating a hot pocket!"

115
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
 But anyways.

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,760
 Oh, don't worry, this episode gets way grosser than that.

117
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,000
 But not gross for gross sake.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
 It's gross for spooky sake.

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,080
 This one's gross for gross sake.

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,600
 I was gonna post this on Instagram and Twitter and I thought, "No, probably get those accounts

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 taken down."

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
 If I say, "Hey guys, check this out!"

123
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
 It's kind of gross.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
 But I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

125
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,800
 Because the podcast can't get taken down because I tell you about this YouTube video.

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,680
 Dear walking.

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
 It's gross.

128
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
 But it's not just like, "Let's put it in a horror context."

129
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,560
 Otherwise, this is just a gore.

130
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,600
 I wonder if they have a gore podcast.

131
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,880
 They're like, "Dude, today we're going to BrainsExploding.com."

132
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
 And they're reviewing gore sites.

133
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
 And they're like, "Oh dude, look at that."

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 You know what?

135
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,200
 Now that I've said that, now that I've put that out into the universe, someone will start

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
 one.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 But don't.

138
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
 It would be really weird to just talk about pictures.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,960
 It'd be the same thing if you had an art podcast and you're like, "Dude, look at the

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
 brushstrokes on that."

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
 You're like, "I can't!

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,440
 I'm driving a car and I'm listening to audio.

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
 What are you talking about?"

144
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,600
 But that, but about gore.

145
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,280
 This is the beginning of that type of podcast.

146
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,920
 But it also is spooky because it happened during October.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
 It's definitely sad.

148
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,520
 Oh, I should get to this.

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
 They don't know what caused it, which makes it spooky as well.

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,040
 Some people say flesh-eating bacteria, little micro-blanded on his back one day, it went

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 "Argh!"

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,040
 And then the next day there were two microbes and they go "Argh!"

153
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,280
 And the next day there was three.

154
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
 Is that how that works?

155
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
 "Argh!"

156
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
 Until eventually there's a billion of them.

157
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
 Flesh-eating virus, because he was totally fine in September.

158
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
 Flesh-eating virus.

159
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,520
 Some people say it was a bullet.

160
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,600
 I mean, it would have to be like an entire machine gun.

161
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,120
 He was straight up trying to save Private Ryan.

162
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,880
 But the most reasonable one is that he got hit by a combine.

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,760
 Like he was laying in a field or something like that.

164
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
 Because they said it's like a...

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,520
 You're like, "Jason, you can stop describing the deer now."

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 Okay, we'll wrap it up.

167
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,760
 It's like a chunk taken off of him.

168
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
 But they don't know what caused it.

169
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
 They said he doesn't have long to live.

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
 He won't be able to heal before winter or before predator or before infection sets in.

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,480
 So if you're a hunter in the Illinois area and you have nothing better to do, well you're

172
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
 a hunter.

173
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 So this is what you do.

174
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,960
 This is what the better thing for you to do is this is your hobby.

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,000
 Go out and either put the steer out of its misery or...

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,520
 Like, I don't know.

177
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 I don't know what the alternative is.

178
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
 It's sad.

179
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,720
 He's a little deer bro.

180
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,960
 Maybe you could like go out and like, I don't know, pet him and stuff.

181
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,280
 He's like, "No, yes, a huge open wound."

182
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,520
 He's like, "Dude, did you bring any percocet?"

183
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,440
 You could probably, yeah, like give him pain pills or something like that.

184
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,600
 Because you're getting gourd to death.

185
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,480
 You're like, "Ah, no, take the pills."

186
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,960
 He just keeps attacking you.

187
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,200
 Obviously, to wrap this up, finally, the horror version is that it's some sort of zombie

188
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 deer.

189
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,680
 Like, this is the beginning of a zombie outbreak.

190
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,320
 So there you go.

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,720
 That is why that justifies me talking about it.

192
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,120
 In the Halloween episode of Dead Rav Ready, I saw the video and it was so disturbing.

193
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,440
 It looks, the deer actually looks quite fine with it.

194
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,920
 He's not like struggling.

195
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 I don't know what a struggling deer would look like, but he looks like he's just walking,

196
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,720
 but you can see the skin opening.

197
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,400
 Mr. Twister throws up at a bunch of pumpkin seeds.

198
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,760
 Blah, blah, like having a pat him on the back.

199
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
 Hold back his stem.

200
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,680
 Okay, Mr. Twister, are you ready to drive us out of here?

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,800
 He's like, "Aren't you going to take care of this deer?"

202
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
 He keeps talking about wanting to take care of this deer.

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,560
 I gave him a shot of heroin that I just have on me, had it in the glove box.

204
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,120
 So he's having a good time now.

205
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,320
 But after Mr. Twister is done cleaning up my car, don't throw up in my car, bro, we

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 are headed.

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,240
 He's like, "Don't take me to a gore story with half a deer."

208
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,040
 Mr. Twister, call in that Dead Rabbit Durgeable.

209
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,720
 We are leaving behind Illinois.

210
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,400
 We are headed out to Chile.

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,920
 Dead Rabbit Durgeable is flying overhead.

212
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,000
 Now the balloon is in the shape of a big old pumpkin head to make it extra spooky.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
 There's fake cobwebs everywhere.

214
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,960
 What's going on?

215
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,720
 This is like some eighth grade Halloween party.

216
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,600
 I was like, "I know, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

217
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 Got it all at the dollar store."

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,360
 It's summer 1972.

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,200
 We're headed out to Hooli Dad.

220
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,120
 That's in the region de los Legos in Chile.

221
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
 It's evening.

222
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
 It's not super dark out, but it's probably a little too dark to be walking by yourself.

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,840
 But it is 1972 and kids were kind of allowed a little more freedom back then.

224
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,320
 As we're up in this Durgeable, we see a 15 year old girl walking down the street.

225
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
 She's headed to her grandmother's house, stereotypically enough.

226
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
 And her name is Blanca Esther Cardenas Reign.

227
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
 Her grandma lived on a hill near the isolated side of town.

228
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
 But again, Blanca's not really thinking anything of it.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
 It's not super dark.

230
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,960
 It's not super spooky.

231
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,160
 She's made this walk before.

232
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
 She's probably about three to four blocks away from her grandmother's house at this point.

233
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,360
 And then she hears something behind her.

234
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:09,520
 She turns and right when she turns, she sees it.

235
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,120
 There's a creature standing there.

236
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
 It's huge.

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,400
 It's six foot five feet tall, covered in hair, but not bigfoot.

238
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 Not bigfoot.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,040
 This is something else.

240
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,240
 It has a long nose or a snout.

241
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
 It has a tail.

242
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,600
 And the longest part of its body are its massive legs.

243
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,880
 She's taking in the sight of this, but what really catches her eye is its eyes.

244
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,480
 They're shining.

245
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,800
 And she says she says, this is all happening within a split second.

246
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,520
 She sees this creature jump up out of the ditch, stares at her, and she says her entire

247
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,960
 body feels like it's electrically shocked.

248
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,320
 It's just that where you feel it in your bones, you feel it in your teeth.

249
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,120
 She just feels a shock.

250
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,320
 She believes this creature has emitted some sort of beam out of its eyes and hits her.

251
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,540
 She turns to run.

252
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:12,680
 She knows instinctively she needs to get out of the street and the closest place to run

253
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,920
 that she knows of is her grandmother's house.

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,840
 She's running through this part of town.

255
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,440
 And it is an isolated part of town.

256
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,680
 There's not a lot of stuff out here anyways.

257
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:34,840
 And she hears the creature behind her emit a terrifying screech and then a pause.

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,020
 And she stumbles.

259
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,620
 She hears the screech again and she's running.

260
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,140
 She's running.

261
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,900
 And again she stumbles.

262
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,900
 What she realizes is going on behind her.

263
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,260
 This creature is screaming and launching itself into the air.

264
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,580
 And when it lands, she feels the earth shake.

265
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,140
 And it's getting closer to her.

266
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,640
 Everything this creature can do to slow her down is working.

267
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,880
 Blanca though is able to reach the clearing where her grandmother's house is at and the

268
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,000
 creature stops, stares at her and disappears back into the darkness.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,640
 Blanca is completely hysterical as any of us would be.

270
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,800
 She runs in and she tells her grandmother what just happened.

271
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,640
 The grandmother says, "Don't speak of this again.

272
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,100
 You have to keep quiet about it."

273
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
 What do you mean?

274
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,100
 I just was just pursued by a monster who electrocuted me, who was shattering the ground, who was

275
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
 trying to get me.

276
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,580
 What do you mean, "stay quiet about this?"

277
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:48,580
 And the grandma said, "You have to stay quiet about this or quote, it will kill her."

278
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,700
 Two months later, I'm assuming Blanca didn't leave the house for two months, right?

279
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
 She's all campin' out there.

280
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,340
 She's like, "Hey mom, dad, can you like mail all of my stuff here and mail my school here

281
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,960
 and all of my friends?"

282
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,040
 Blanca does eventually go home.

283
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,000
 Two months later, Blanca's grandmother died.

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,520
 This was originally told by Antonio Cardenas Tabes in the book called Abdorje Al Caluce,

285
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,640
 which means approach to Caluce.

286
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,080
 Caluce, we actually covered a long time ago in the story about the imbuce.

287
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,040
 It's this Chilean wizards who would create these monstrosities.

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,260
 We covered that a lot in the episode like 150 or something like that.

289
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,860
 It was a really good episode.

290
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,540
 They create these creatures and they use...

291
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,820
 The caluce is basically the Chilean version of the flying Dutchman.

292
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,980
 It's like a ghost ship.

293
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,480
 And it's kind of like...

294
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,460
 It ties into other stories in the area.

295
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:50,420
 The wizards of Chile were actually using that ship to smuggle goods.

296
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,740
 If you really want to listen to a trippy episode, look up the episode on the imbuce that I did,

297
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,960
 because I really go into depth.

298
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,340
 But Antonio wrote this book called Approach to Caluce.

299
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,420
 And it was a collection of cryptid stories, weird, creepy events.

300
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,240
 It was a collection of stories.

301
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,220
 So that's where this story originally comes from.

302
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,460
 I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, but they got it from there.

303
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,340
 Very, very interesting story, because yes, we have all the hallmarks of an urban legend,

304
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,040
 creatures, cryptid, whatever.

305
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,540
 But there's two really cool details I want to focus on.

306
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,860
 One, the grandma says you have to keep quiet or quote, it will kill her.

307
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,540
 Now when I first read that, I'm sure there's translation errors, obviously.

308
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,800
 When I first read that, I saw that as the grandma saying, "Don't talk about it or it's

309
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,620
 going to get you."

310
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,660
 But as I was rereading it in preparation to do the story, I thought, "The grandma might

311
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,220
 have meant, don't tell anyone or it'll kill me."

312
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,860
 You know, I mean, maybe you're like, "Chase and no!"

313
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,520
 She said, "Quote, she said it will kill her."

314
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,240
 But you understand, like, if the 15-year-old girl is running her mouth about it, because

315
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,880
 obviously she did, because we've heard this story, she didn't keep quiet.

316
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,480
 And if the grandma was saying, if the girl was basically the one being quoted, not the

317
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 grand...

318
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,560
 I know it's confusing and there's translation issues, but you know what I mean, like, it's

319
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,360
 possible the grandma said, "You can't tell anyone about this or it'll kill me."

320
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
 And then the daughter, when she was telling the story to Antonio, said, "My grandma told

321
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,700
 me not to tell anyone or it'll kill her."

322
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
 The author of the book looks up, he's like, "Say what?"

323
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,380
 And she's like, "Oh yeah, she said if I ever told this story, my grandma would die."

324
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,020
 And then you hear like, "Ahhh!"

325
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,740
 Three to four blocks away.

326
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
 So you have that.

327
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,060
 You have that interesting thing.

328
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,940
 Again, if it's not a translation error, then it definitely didn't get her, because she

329
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
 told the story later.

330
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,220
 But there's another real fascinating thing about this.

331
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,820
 This doesn't seem like a cryptid.

332
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,980
 This seems like a biological creature, and here's why.

333
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,000
 And I kind of started thinking about other ways this happens as well.

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,120
 This creature was actually using techniques that real predators use, which is shocking.

335
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
 Not like, "I'm gonna tell you a story about a gross deer!"

336
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
 And the animal's like, "Uhhh!"

337
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,360
 You know what I mean, like an electric eel type shock?

338
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,040
 Or a stun attack.

339
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,960
 Like they do have animals that will like, flap their wings so much that like stuns little

340
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,540
 insects, and definitely you have things like electric eels.

341
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,620
 It was basically doing things that we know real predators do.

342
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:31,700
 It wasn't trying to like, make you wear your shoes on backwards, or shooting out flame.

343
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,980
 It wasn't doing stuff that we see cryptids do.

344
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,980
 Casting spells, or making music, and things like that.

345
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,580
 Some sort of stun attack, or some sort of electrical attack.

346
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,820
 Are things predators actually do?

347
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,620
 On Earth, that is verifiable.

348
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,640
 So I thought those were some interesting details.

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,240
 It wasn't doing, and even the screechy noise is something that a predator will do.

350
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
 To kind of shock their prey.

351
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:03,360
 You wonder how many creatures and humans have been stalked by this thing.

352
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
 That weren't able to recover from a stumble.

353
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,440
 That weren't able to recover from being shocked.

354
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,940
 Both of those things would take out a huge amount of prey.

355
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,860
 Why it didn't come in to the grandmother's property?

356
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
 Who knows.

357
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,740
 That makes it, goes back to the cryptid version, right?

358
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,820
 Because a lion's not chasing you, and then it's like, "Ugh, protected ground.

359
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,220
 You're safe now, monkey man.

360
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,300
 But soon I will be back."

361
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,780
 Like that doesn't have to, he just follows you and eats you and then eats everyone that

362
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,340
 you led him to.

363
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,840
 That makes the story a little more cryptid-ish as well, but I thought it was interesting

364
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,200
 this creature was using tactics we know that real predators use.

365
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 Mr. Twister's nodding.

366
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
 He's nodding off.

367
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
 He took some of that heroin I gave the deer.

368
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,960
 Hey, wake up, wake up, wake up.

369
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
 Narcanum.

370
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
 And then Mr. Twister, let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter.

371
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,520
 We are leaving behind Chile, and we are headed out to London.

372
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,580
 The helicopter has a skull painted on the side of it, that's all I did.

373
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,620
 I spent all my money decorating the dead rabbit, there's a bull.

374
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,860
 As that carpenter copter is crossing the Atlantic Ocean, I turn to you, I hold a flashlight

375
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:22,100
 underneath my face, and I go, "This Halloween, we've got a special treat for you.

376
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,620

 Imprisoned by a mysterious woman.

382

 Let me out.

383
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,920
 Practicing hoodoo magic.

384
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,280
 Uh, she's just waving her hands.

385
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,320
 Magic's having a happening.

386
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,760
 He desperately tries to break free to save his family from the sinister rituals that

387
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,840
 await.

390
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:28,760
 T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

391
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,620
 We're landing on a bunch of old timey cars.

392
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,420
 It's 1983.

393
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,900
 So that's old timey, right?

394
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,980
 I was alive back then.

395
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,260
 I'm still alive now, but more old timey than now.

396
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,020
 It's February 8th, 1983.

397
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,900
 So when we're there, we walk up to 23 Cranley Gardens.

398
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,620
 There's not actually 23 different gardens.

399
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,740
 I'm like, "Ooh, which one to choose?"

400
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
 That's the address.

401
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,980
 23 Cranley Gardens.

402
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,780
 There's a house that has three people living in it.

403
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,220
 We have Dennis.

404
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,520
 We have Mark.

405
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 And we have Valerie.

406
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
 "Aw, bloody hell.

407
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,920
 I can't get this drain to work," says Mark as he's downstairs.

408
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,600
 And everyone's like, "Dude, when'd you become a stereotypical British?"

409
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,120
 He's like, "Oi, oi, oi.

410
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,000
 Aw, I can't get it to work.

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,040
 It's been bloody out of work."

412
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,440
 And it's true, their drains aren't working.

413
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,880
 So they're like washing carrots and stuff like that.

414
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,880
 And the water is just like sitting in the drain.

415
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,600
 And they're like, "Oh, man."

416
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,380
 And then they're like, "I guess I just gotta eat this dirty carrot."

417
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
 Which is fine, okay?

418
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,140
 You can't wash stuff, whatever.

419
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
 Like yeah, that's inconvenient.

420
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
 Actually, that's incredibly insanitary.

421
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,980
 That's how so many diseases are caused.

422
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,860
 But whatever, you can figure that out.

423
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,660
 The big problem is their toilets aren't working.

424
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,740
 That's something you can't go more than a day without.

425
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,860
 If all of a sudden, I don't wash my food anyways.

426
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,260
 I can't remember the last time.

427
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,300
 One of my washing cans.

428
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 Cans are aviol-y.

429
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 I'm washing them underneath the sink.

430
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
 I don't wash food.

431
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,160
 But I guess people who eat like vegetable-people who eat those things that I don't eat, I

432
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,660
 can vegetables.

433
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,700
 If you buy like apples and stuff or carrots, you love to disdain in my voice.

434
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,180
 Do you love the tone of my voice when I talk about this stuff?

435
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,500
 You grab a carrot or something like that.

436
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,140
 You're washing it.

437
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,580
 And if you have to do that, again, I don't know if that's something you have to do.

438
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,180
 You're like, "Everyone yelled at once, 'Yes!'

439
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,900
 You're supposed to wash your food.

440
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,180
 How are you alive this long?"

441
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,940
 But if you can't do that, then it's what?

442
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,700
 You take it outside, you use the garden hose.

443
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,420
 You can't poop in your yard.

444
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,100
 You can, but there's a whole host of other crimes that are being committed.

445
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,300
 So they have to get their toilets fixed.

446
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,580
 That's a very, very long way in this already long episode to explain they have to get their

447
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
 toilets fixed.

448
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
 So they call a plumber.

449
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,300
 They've tried fixing it themselves.

450
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,700
 The landlord tried fixing it.

451
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,180
 This has been going on for days.

452
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,380
 They call a plumber.

453
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,900
 So Dino Rod sends out Michael Catran.

454
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,140
 He's walking down the street.

455
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
 I'm sure he had a van.

456
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,540
 Actually, I don't know why he's walking on the street.

457
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,780
 He has a matchstick in his mouth.

458
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,900
 He's flicking it out, cowboy hat on.

459
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,420
 He drives up in his Dino Rod van, jumps out.

460
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
 What's going on, guys?

461
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,140
 They're like, "They have no time to chat.

462
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,980
 They all really have to go to the bathroom.

463
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
 It's been days."

464
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,100
 He's like, "Oh, okay."

465
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,580
 So he's checking everything in the house and he goes, "Whatever it is, it's not in the

466
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
 house."

467
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,060
 "I'm going to go into the sewer."

468
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
 There's a huge problem.

469
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
 It's that bad.

470
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,100
 Generally, the plumbers aren't going down into the sewer, but he's done everything he can

471
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
 in the house.

472
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
 It has to go down.

473
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
 So...

474
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
 [grunt]

475
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
 [crunch]

476
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,900
 ...moves the sewer manhole cover, crawls down into the sewer.

477
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
 Little feet.

478
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,780
 I'm sure he has a normal-sized feet, but that's his feet making sounds, walking through the

479
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
 sewage.

480
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,540
 He finds the pipes that are coming down from this house at 23 Cranley Gardens and he sees

481
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,660
 something sitting outside the pipes.

482
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,860
 So he's still in the sewer, but where the pipe exits the wall, there's like a pile.

483
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,940
 It's about eight inches thick.

484
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,220
 That's a huge pile of something.

485
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,500
 And he's looking at it and he's like, "What in tarnation is that?"

486
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,940
 Shining his flashlight on it.

487
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 Crawls out his pen and he's poking it a bit.

488
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,620
 What in the world is this?

489
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,540
 He has an idea what it is.

490
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,420
 But he's never seen it before.

491
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,620
 Crawls up out of the sewer.

492
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,620
 [laughs]

493
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,060
 Can I use your phone to feed people with this before cell phones?

494
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,740
 So you have to let sewer man back in your house.

495
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,460
 He's like, "Guys, listen, I'm fixing your toilet."

496
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,300
 So yes, it may track in a little bit of sewage.

497
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,460
 That's part of the job.

498
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,700
 Like, I have to use your phone though.

499
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,900
 Calls up his boss at Dino Rod.

500
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 Gary Wheeler.

501
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
 "Hey, Gary.

502
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 Yeah, this is Michael.

503
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,500
 Yeah, you sent me out to 23 Cranley Gardens.

504
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,020
 I'm here trying to fix the toilets.

505
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,260
 It's not anything in the house.

506
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,140
 I think it's in the sewer.

507
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,380
 And I think you need to come out here.

508
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,220
 I think you need to come out and check this out."

509
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
 Uh-huh.

510
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
 Uh-huh.

511
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
 [laughs]

512
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,740
 Conversation goes on for another 20 minutes.

513
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
 I'm just going, "Uh-huh.

514
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,900
 Okay, awesome mate.

515
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
 Bye."

516
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
 Hangs the phone up.

517
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,460
 He turns to Dennis, Mark, and Valerie and says, "Yeah, we could probably fix it.

518
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,660
 I need to have my boss come out and check this out."

519
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
 And they're like, "Well, why?"

520
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,620
 And he goes, "I don't want to alarm anybody, but this may be something more than just a

521
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
 blockage."

522
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,060
 Cheerio starts walking back to the sewer.

523
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,020
 They're like, "That alarms us even more."

524
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,180
 And he goes, "Well, you guys want to come down and take a look at it?"

525
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,820
 Now Valerie's like, "I'm good."

526
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,980
 Mark and Dennis go into the sewer.

527
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,060
 I would love to go into the sewer, dude.

528
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,580
 That's like on my bucket list.

529
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,100
 It's to go into the sewer.

530
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,060
 But anyways, or a storm drain.

531
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
 Either one.

532
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
 But it's safe.

533
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,580
 I don't want to be just like in a storm going down one.

534
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,660
 Dennis, Michael, and Mark walk down into the sewer and he shows them this pile, this

535
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,540
 eight-inch thick pile.

536
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:55,420
 There's about 30 pieces of a pale, gooey substance.

537
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,220
 Mark's like, "What?

538
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,780
 What is that?"

539
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,980
 Dennis gets down and he's looking at it.

540
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
 He goes, "You know what?

541
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,900
 It looks like someone was flushing their KFC down the toilet."

542
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
 Michael goes, "Yeah, I guess.

543
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,300
 I said, 'Is there a KFC around here?

544
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,660
 I'm actually kind of hungry.'"

545
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,380
 And they have a working bathroom.

546
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,900
 And around this time, the boss shows up.

547
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,260
 Gary shows up, walks down into the sewer.

548
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,900
 He's like, "What do you have these other two people here, dude?

549
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,140
 This is our workspace.

550
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,420
 You just can't invite people down."

551
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,020
 Get up, get up.

552
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,140
 So then Dennis and Mark have to leave.

553
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,740
 Dennis and Mark end up leaving.

554
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,460
 And Gary goes, "So this is what you wanted to show me?"

555
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,340
 Michael's like, "Yeah, look at this."

556
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,380
 Now I'm not an expert by any means.

557
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,060
 I'm just a simple plumber.

558
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,540
 But you know what that looks like to me?

559
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,740
 And Gary's looking at it for a bit and he goes, "That looks like human flesh."

560
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,820
 Michael goes, "Yeah, that's exactly what I thought, too."

561
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,980
 I've never seen human flesh come out of a sewer drain before.

562
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
 But I can imagine.

563
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,940
 I've seen a lot of other stuff come out of a sewer drain.

564
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,780
 If you were to put human flesh in a sewer drain, that's what it would look like.

565
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,900
 So they go back, at this point it's like 7.30 at night.

566
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,900
 Because it took them a long time just to even find this issue and then to call the boss.

567
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,020
 They crawl back up out of the sewer and they tell the people at the house.

568
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,260
 They tell Valerie, Mark, and Dennis, "Hey, listen, we're still looking into this.

569
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,620
 We may need to call the police because there's something going on down there.

570
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
 Don't be alarmed."

571
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,020
 They're like, "Wait, telling us not to be alarmed."

572
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,140
 And making alarming statements at the same time.

573
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,980
 They said, "Don't be alarmed, but don't be also alarmed if the police show up tomorrow.

574
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,260
 We're going to show back up tomorrow.

575
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,260
 We don't know what it is.

576
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
 Could be nothing.

577
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,260
 Could be nothing at all.

578
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
 Cheerio, mate."

579
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,300
 Dino Rod employees leave and everyone retires to the room.

580
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,500
 Dennis is at the very top, Mark is in the middle, and Valerie is on the bottom floor.

581
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 Everyone goes to bed.

582
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,260
 But in the middle of the night, Mark wakes up and he goes, "I can't sleep."

583
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,700
 Like, I mean, who could?

584
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,620
 One, I think my bowels are getting impacted.

585
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,180
 I haven't gone to the bathroom in days.

586
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,820
 And two, there might be some sort of monster living in the sewer.

587
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,620
 So he goes down and there's like a little sitting room downstairs.

588
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,580
 And he goes down, he sees a light on.

589
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,820
 He's like, "What?"

590
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,180
 He opens the door.

591
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:27,880
 And he sees Valerie sitting awake in this room down in the parlor area, maybe.

592
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,680
 So Mark goes in and sits down and he goes, "Can't sleep?"

593
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,120
 Valerie's like, "No, I'm afraid there's a sewer monster and I have to go to the bathroom."

594
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, me too."

595
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,660
 So they decide to just kind of stay up for a while, chat a bit.

596
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:52,020
 It's getting late, two, three in the morning, and they hear a noise.

597
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,460
 Someone's walking down the stairs.

598
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,040
 Now they know that they're not the only two people in the house.

599
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,420
 So they think maybe it's Dennis not being able to sleep, also afraid of the flesh monster,

600
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,800
 walking down to join them.

601
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,040
 Footsteps stop.

602
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,540
 And then they hear the front door open.

603
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,040
 We're sitting there and it's silent for a while.

604
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,700
 And then they hear a sound that they had heard earlier in the day.

605
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,140
 It was the sound of the manhole cover being removed again.

606
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,040
 There's more silence.

607
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:45,060
 And then they hear a "pew, pew, pew."

608
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,480
 They hear the manhole cover pushed back over the manhole.

609
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:56,680
 They hear the front door close and they hear footsteps leading back up to Dennis's room.

610
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,260
 The next morning, Dino Rod, Michael and Gary show back up.

611
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,740
 They move the manhole cover, they go down.

612
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,180
 There's no pile of flesh.

613
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,020
 They start asking the people in the house, "Hey, what happened?

614
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
 We..."

615
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,900
 Unless it's sentient and it moved, it's not there anymore.

616
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,100
 And that's when Mark and Valerie say, "We think we heard something last night.

617
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:24,420
 We think our roommate Dennis went down there and moved the flesh."

618
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,320
 And they were actually able to say from the sound of the wet, sloppy noise, they said

619
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,440
 it sounded like he was throwing it over the fence.

620
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,040
 So at that point, the plumbers are like, "Okay, we have to call the authorities."

621
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,540
 Like, first we thought we could be wrong.

622
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,380
 Maybe it's not human flesh or it's human flesh from somewhere else.

623
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,400
 But the pipe that was laying underneath seemed to be the pipe that would have fed out of

624
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,120
 Dennis's room.

625
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,820
 The story ends with the police showing up, being shown the pile of goo over the fence.

626
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,420
 They do find another piece of it was human flesh farther back in the pipe.

627
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,860
 That pipe that it was underneath in the sewer led up to Dennis's room.

628
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,740
 They sent the goo.

629
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,260
 They just bagged it up in a Ziploc bag.

630
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,340
 They sent it to a corner and he identified it.

631
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,820
 Yes, this is human flesh.

632
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,800
 And they end up arresting the man who had the attic room.

633
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,680
 His name was Dennis Nilsson, serial killer.

634
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,280
 He had ended up killing, they say, minimum of 12 people.

635
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,680
 He operated between the years 1978 and 1983.

636
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,720
 His modus operandi, he was gay.

637
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,680
 He would pick up men, gay men from bars, take them back to his place and strangle them or

638
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
 drown them.

639
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,860
 He'd usually get them drunk or on drugs, he'd strangle them or drown them.

640
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,340
 And then he would bathe them after they were dead, dress them up in clothes and then cuddle

641
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,760
 with them, leave them in bed with him for weeks at a time until the smell got too bad

642
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,980
 and then he would burn them in a massive bonfire.

643
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,120
 That's when he lived in a house where he could do those things.

644
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,540
 But he ended up having to leave that property behind and got stuck living in an attic where

645
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,680
 he couldn't have this cleansing ritual.

646
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,560
 A lot of times in serial killers, bathe bodies or burn bodies, it's not necessarily part

647
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,160
 of the hiding the evidence.

648
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,000
 Sometimes it is, but it's a part of a ritual of cleansing them of their sins or your sins

649
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 or both.

650
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,160
 Since he couldn't do that, but he still had a compulsion to kill people, he'd kill three

651
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:41,520
 people in this attic spot of 23 Cranley Gardens and he was having to dissect them and he could

652
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,960
 dispose of some of the body parts when it was possible, but I mean when you're killing

653
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,900
 multiple 180 pound men, you just had to start stuffing it down into the drain, flushing it

654
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,060
 down the toilet, until eventually it made a mass of human flesh in the pipes.

655
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,340
 So much so, remember there was only 8 inches of it, about 30 pieces of it on the bottom.

656
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,360
 The rest of the human skin and muscle tissue and everything like that was stuffed in the

657
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,400
 pipes of the house, that's why no one could go to the bathroom.

658
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:22,120
 He was in the process of dismembering a body when the plumbers originally showed up.

659
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,140
 He had someone up there and after the first time of meeting with the plumbers, he knows

660
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,800
 that things are almost up, he has this half dismembered body in his room.

661
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,940
 The rest of it is stuffed in the drains that the plumbers are looking at.

662
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,900
 He just sat in the dark and drank with a corpse next to him, wondering what was going to happen

663
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,140
 next.

664
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,420
 His idea, first was to blame it on KFC, his second thing was when he went down and removed

665
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,500
 the guts, removed the handfuls of skin, threw them over the fence, he was going to put some

666
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,980
 chicken down, he was going to go to KFC and put some chicken down and be like "oh yeah

667
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,840
 look it, it's just chicken."

668
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,680
 Had the two roommates not heard that sequence of events, there is a chance that he would

669
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,440
 have gotten away with it.

670
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,400
 He ended up dying in 2018, he lived quite a long time, he was sentenced to life in prison,

671
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,200
 he died in 2018 in health related issues.

672
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,320
 The names of the tenants I had to make up, I don't remember the names of the tenants.

673
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,040
 And when you read about Dennis Nelson, there's always like one or two paragraphs describing

674
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,620
 the story I just told, so how was I able to describe it in such detail?

675
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:36,940
 I read a book about him years ago and the first three chapters were basically that story

676
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,740
 I just told you.

677
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,200
 And I just imagined the suspense these people must have been going through over the course

678
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,740
 of that 24 hours.

679
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,700
 First you just really need to go to the bathroom and then you find out that there's flesh

680
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,580
 coming out of your pipes.

681
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,000
 And it's one of those things where you know it's not you, but there's other people in

682
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,920
 the house it could be.

683
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
 You know what I mean?

684
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,440
 And you know it's something.

685
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,840
 I mean obviously he could have been mistaken, someone could have been flesh in their KFC

686
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
 down in the toilet.

687
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,520
 This is a great ad for KFC by the way, it looks just like human flesh that comes out of the

688
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
 sewer.

689
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,280
 I remember reading the book, I actually stopped reading the book because then I realized the

690
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,480
 next 300 pages was him just killing.

691
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
 And I'm not a huge fan of serial killers to begin with and it was just like I read the

692
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,140
 first three kills and it was the same thing over and over again.

693
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
 I was like ugh.

694
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,140
 I'm like people are entertaining, why aren't you building saw traps Dennis?

695
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:34,140
 But I remember it's so funny because I didn't really remember anything about the killer

696
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,260
 or I had to look up everything else.

697
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:46,300
 But I never forgot that story about people just living their lives, roommates and plumbers

698
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,660
 and some boss at Dino Rod thinking oh come on Michael you gotta have me come down there

699
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
 to do your job.

700
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,440
 What do you think I pay you for and he walks into the sewer and he's like what in the world

701
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,320
 is this?

702
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,160
 That story never left me and the idea of staying up all night is you can't sleep and then hearing

703
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
 those noises.

704
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,040
 Not seeing it so you don't know for sure if that's Dennis.

705
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,440
 But they had a pretty good, I mean there's two of them in the room and there's three

706
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,880
 people living in the house and you hear those footsteps and you're waiting, yeah it's just

707
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,960
 a whole tension behind that story.

708
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,680
 Now I'm not minimizing the fact that he was killing these people, obviously they went

709
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,580
 through their own torment and like one or two survived.

710
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,500
 But unfortunately serial killers and their victims and stuff like those stories are so

711
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
 commonplace.

712
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,380
 It's very rare that we get a story that's a view from outside of the victim and outside

713
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
 of the killer.

714
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,940
 It's just people trying to go to the bathroom who get wrapped up in the sickness of a man

715
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,840
 who's fleshing human remains down a toilet.

716
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,440
 But this story isn't buried in the past, remember he died in 2018.

717
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:05,360
 In 2017 in Oshawa, Ontario, Adam Strong, 47 year old man, calls in a plumber because his

718
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,160
 pipes don't work.

719
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,880
 Plumber very quickly finds out that there is the flesh of a murdered teenage girl that

720
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:22,740
 he had been flushing down the toilet.

721
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,220
 So that my fiendish friends is the end of the Dead Rabbit Radio Halloween special, Evil

722
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,060
 Never Slumbers.

723
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,740
 I guess if you have to describe the sound effect it didn't come across.

724
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,980
 But I hope you guys have an awesome Halloween.

725
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,180
 I hope you guys have lots of fun.

726
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,040
 I hope you guys eat all the candy you want and remember if you're at your friends house

727
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:55,920
 and the toilet doesn't work, don't call a plumber, call the police and then a plumber.
