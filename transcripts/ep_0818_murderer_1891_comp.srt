1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 When is it not okay to take the law into your own hands?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we traveled to England to meet two friends casually smoking cigarettes on a lonely night.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Well, it was lonely until the aliens showed up.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And then we take a look at one of the most terrifying spectral encounters on record.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 What happens when there is a ghost that is so powerful, simply seeing it turns you into a cold blooded murderer today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our livestream supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Get ready to take a taste of Chime Chili.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy. Give me your Chime Chili.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Chime, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, if you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Just helps spread the word about the show. That also really, really helps out a lot.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Now Chime, I'm gonna start off by giving you the keys to the Jason's Loppy.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Catch them in your chili hands, dripping with meats and sauces.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. I'm gonna grab some cornbread and we are headed all the way out to...

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Texas.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I wanna say, you know, on Monday's episode, I've been thinking a lot about this.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 On Monday's episode, it was about... You're like, "Jason, please, come on man, that episode's hard enough to listen to, please."

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I talked about this idiot, this scum, a piece of filth on this earth called Jeffrey Portway.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And he had built this secret base. He's caught... He wasn't able to pull off any of his plans, but he built this secret soundproof dungeon in his house.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And he had like castration tools and a child-sized coffin and he wanted to eat children.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He was talking online about eating kids and all that stuff.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And he's locked away for only 27 years. He should be locked away until the sun burns out.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But anyways, he had a bunch of child porn and worse stuff.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 He had worse images than child porn, if you can believe that. But he had them.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And I was talking, specifically talking, he was afraid of COVID, catching COVID in his cell and I said things like,

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 "We should pump COVID directly into his cell and other stuff."

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I wanna clarify those comments. I don't apologize to him at all. I didn't get contacted by his lawyers and I didn't get contacted by YouTube for making comments.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Those comments obviously, you know, it's heightened reality. It's jokes legally, legally speaking.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But I wanted to say this because I know a lot of people listen to this show.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I know this show has a really big audience and it's a global audience and it's mostly men.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I've mentioned this once or twice on this show. I was actually trained to be a sexual assault counselor.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I volunteered at a women's shelter. I don't even know if they're still around, but when I was living in Sacramento,

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I was a volunteer at a women's shelter and I was trained as a sexual assault counselor.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And I become, because I'm a giant broad-shouldered hairy man, they said, "You will not walk into rooms with women who have been victimized by men."

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 You, I was specifically trained for two groups. Male victims, and there's a lot of them.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And male family members.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 That's what my training was, was to go into these hospital rooms, to go into these police stations,

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 and to calm down fathers and brothers and uncles and friends from going out and just slaughtering the suspects.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 It was all de-escalation training and it's interesting that de-escalation training has helped me throughout my life.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Like, it was a really, really good program. I'm glad I had the opportunity to do it.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So what I'm talking about, I'm talking about pumping COVID into Jeffrey Portway's cell.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 A joke, legally. I want to be very, very clear. And it kind of broke my heart.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I read this article the other day and I wanted to share this with you and just go over it briefly.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But this happened really recently. A lot of you guys probably are aware of it.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 In Texas, this was just happened January 19th, 2022. We're in the city of Far, Texas.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 There's a guy named Gabriel Quintanilla. He's a 42-year-old man.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And he was accused of having sexually assaulted his 9-year-old daughter.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And these accusations went around the RV park where everyone was living.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And they got to the ears of this young girl's stepbrothers, Gabriel's stepson's Christian Trevino, who's 17, and Alexandro Trevino, who's 18.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And they together with their friend, Juan Melendez, beat this guy to death.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 They beat Gabriel Quintanilla to death. And it wasn't necessarily a crime of passion legally, although I would not convict these guys if I was on the jury.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They beat him up at the RV park. He escaped. They caught up to him at a local apartment complex and beat him up.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 That's where Juan got into the fight. And two other dudes, two other guys who were just walking through the parking lot.

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 They saw these three guys beating up this dude. "Hey, what's going on? Oh, this guy molested this little girl."

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And they jumped in and they started beating. But then those other two dudes left.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And Gabriel left that scene as well. He escaped that fight. And now he's walking down the road.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And Juan and Christian and Alexandro catch up to him in a pickup truck.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And they jump out of the pickup truck and beat him up more and throw him in the flatbed of the truck.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And they drive off. And the next day he's dead.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And I read that and obviously I understand that... you understand doing that, right?

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But later on in the article, it states that Gabriel was being sought after by the authorities.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 They knew of these allegations. Charges had been filed. They were going to arrest him and take him into the court system

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 and put him up for trial. And hopefully the jury would do the right thing and this guy would be put away.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And instead, he's dead, which that's that, right? Horrible, horrible person.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But this young girl, this nine-year-old sister, lost two great men.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Right, not her dad, but Christian and Alexandro.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Think about how much they loved her so much. They put their lives on the line.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And they put their freedom on the line for her. And really, really, really...

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I prefer a world where these two young men are free and they teach that girl what a real man is like.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And in a way they did, obviously, she knows that she has people out there who will stick up for her,

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 but all of those other life lessons, you know, going through as she's going through middle school and high school

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and she's a young woman going into college and all this stuff.

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 This was my job, was to talk to fathers and uncles and brothers and friends and being like,

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 "She needs you now more than ever." Like, I get it.

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 You know who the guy is, friend of the family, maybe a relative,

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 and I get it, you want to leave this hospital room, you want to go home, you want to get that gun,

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 you want to drive to his house, you want to shoot him, but she needs you now.

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Imagine if you do that while she's struggling with the trauma that she's gone through.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 She finds out her dad is arrested.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And now not only does she have to go to criminal proceedings for her own case,

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 she has to go to criminal proceedings and watch the back of her father's head

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 as this judge is talking and the jury is talking and then...

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 She's gone through her trauma, be there with her trauma, be there.

85
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And so I just wanted to clarify that, right?

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I wanted to clarify that I was hoping no one, as I was editing Monday's episode,

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I thought, I mean, I do like it and I stand by the jokes that I was telling,

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 but I was hoping, you know, this is real stuff.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Like, at the end of the day, this is real stuff, and I know a lot of young men listen to this show,

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 listen to this podcast. Doesn't look like it on YouTube,

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 but trust me, the podcast numbers are quite high, and I'm not trying to brag.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I feel like I had a responsibility to do that because if someone was going through this

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 and me as a friend talking about this, joking around in this,

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 if that would embolden someone to go out, I would feel awful,

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 because that is your job right now.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Or maybe you're, hopefully, you'll never have this job,

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 but if you might be your job now, it might have been your job in the past,

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 or it could be your job in the future, is not to go out and be a vigilante and kill these people.

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's to be there for the victims, the people that you care...

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 But trust me, dude, I get it.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I get that these guys did it. I wish, honestly, that it had all happened in one blow,

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 because legally, then you could argue it was a crime of passion, it was an accident.

103
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 When you follow the dude around and then kidnap him...

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So anyways, these guys are facing murder and assault charges and all sorts of stuff.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Oddly enough, they're not facing kidnapping charges, and I think that's to keep the feds off the case.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I think they want to handle this locally, which may be a good sign for these boys.

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 But yeah, yeah, yeah.

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So anyways, I do... you know, vigilante justice is...

109
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It's the most fun justice, it's very quick.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You gotta be careful, otherwise the vigilantes become the lynch mob,

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and there is a fine line between those two things, if the vigilantes become corrupt themselves.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Anyway, crazy true crime story if you guys weren't aware of that, and I wanted to clarify.

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Be there for the victims, do not fly off the handle, be there for the people you love,

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 and show them what a real man is like over the course of years and years and years.

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Don't add to the trauma of her, this young nine-year-old girl.

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I mean, is there anyone to take care of her now?

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Hopefully she has a lot of good family members in the area, hopefully the community.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 There's actually been a petition to drop the charges against these boys.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 This just happened on January 19th, the petition was started shortly after that.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 200,000 people have already signed the petition. 200,000 people are already saying just drop the charges,

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 but unfortunately, they most likely will be charged.

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So again, I just want to say that Jeff Portway's piece of human debris, trash, whatever.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 But yeah, I just wanted to clarify that.

124
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 If you are currently cleaning your shotgun, you are better on the outside than inside.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And I mean, I'm not talking about your looks, and I'm not talking about your personality inside,

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 although I'm sure that's sparkling as well.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Chime Chili, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 We're going to leave behind Texas.

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 We're going to float all the way out to Hessell, England.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 [Hissing]

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 The year is 1980, and we're flying to Hessell, England.

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 That's in the county, the state, whatever it's called, the district of Yorkshire.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And it's nighttime. It's a nice breezy night in 1980.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And there's this guy, we'll call him Carter, and his friend Mike are in this alleyway smoking cigarettes.

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 [Sigh]

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But anyways, they're standing in this alleyway smoking cigarettes, and about 50 yards down the alley,

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 they see this tall guy kind of walking towards them, like, "Hey, mate, look at that tall dude over there."

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And Mikey goes, "I, Governor, I see him with my peepers."

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 They're smoking, and then they're thinking this guy's, like, tall, right?

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So they're what? Probably 5'11", they're probably like me.

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So this dude is, like, basically, he can be any height bigger.

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 You see this 6' tall guy, you're like, "Ah, it's a giant."

143
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 As this guy's walking farther down the alleyway, they start to go, "Aye, he's not just a little tall, me friend."

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They turn into leprechauns at this point. He's not just a little tall, he has to be at least 7' tall.

145
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So this 7' tall dude is walking down the alley towards them, and then, if that's not weird enough, right?

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 'Cause there's 7' tall people. I met Manute Bowl when I was a little kid.

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 That's why I always bring them up on this podcast.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 You know, you realize you're like, "Dude, he does bring up Manute Bowl an awful lot on this podcast."

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 He's the tallest guy I ever met, he was at a grocery store.

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 There's people out there who's 7' tall, there's people out there who walk down alleyways, right?

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But then they realize that this guy is a shadow man.

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Just completely black. Closer blacks, faces black, everything is black.

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 [Growling]

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Walking down the alleyway. They did not say that he was making that noise.

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But as he's walking down this alleyway, they're just staring at this dude,

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and Carter and Mike are watching him, and he's about 10 feet away at this point.

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I don't even know why they waited for him to get this close.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Carter and Mike begin to run the opposite way down the alleyway.

159
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 "Ah! Get out of the way! Trash!" [Splash]

160
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Pushing stuff all over, trying to make their escape.

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 But then, Carter feels a tug on his shirt, thinking, "Oh no, the shadow man got me."

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 But he realizes the hand is Mike's.

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And Mike grabs his shirt and kind of throws him back, and Carter's like,

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 "You bum! He figures that Mike is trying to get around him so he can run faster."

165
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But still, it's kind of the best of things to do.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 But what he realizes very quickly that Mike is not running in front of him

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 so he can outrun Carter, he's running in front of him to stop Carter from getting away.

168
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Carter has to push Mike to one side and continuing to try to get down this alleyway,

169
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 and once again, Mike is pushing himself in front of Carter and trying to block the exit out of the alleyway.

170
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Carter's like, "What are you doing? What are you doing?"

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And there's like this struggle. Carter keeps moving past them,

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 and Mike keeps jumping in front of them, and the whole time, this giant shadow is continuing to walk towards them.

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Eventually, they get out of the alleyway.

174
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 [heavy breathing]

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Oh, me lungs, me lungs hurt.

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And they look down the alleyway, and the shadow man is gone.

177
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Now, Carter has some other businesses to attend to, mostly.

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Mike, why were you trying to stop me from getting out of the alleyway?

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Mike looks at Carter and goes, "What are you talking about?"

180
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So I was running, and you kept jumping in front of me.

181
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Oh, that thing, yeah, that thing where I kept trying to get you out of the--

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 trying to keep in the alleyway, oh yeah, I kind of remember that.

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 He's like, "You should remember that. It just happened a couple seconds ago."

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And Mike never, ever, ever could come up with an explanation as to why he was jumping in front of his friend,

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 trying to slow Carter down while this shadow creature, this giant menace, was chasing them.

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The only thing Carter can really think of is that Mike must have been under some sort of mental control at the moment.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 But that's just the theory. He doesn't know for sure.

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Mike never explained why he tried blocking the exit to the alleyway.

189
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I got that story from Think About It Docs.com.

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 They got it from-- it's a defunct website now, but it was called WhyOrNot.net,

191
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 and that was on the export of-- there's a lot of exports out there.

192
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 This was on a defunct website called WhyOrNot.net.

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Really, really creepy story because it shows that-- you know, you always go ghost hunting in groups.

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Not all the time. I've gone ghost hunting by myself.

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But usually you go in groups, safety in numbers, right? That's kind of the logic.

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Plus, you know you're out having fun, you're impressing some girls and things like that.

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 You're just, you know, looking for something to do on a Saturday night.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Let's go throw beer bottles into a graveyard. Maybe a ghost will show up.

199
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Safety in numbers, right? This story turns that on its head.

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I mean, what the creature was, we don't know.

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Could have been a typical Shadow Man entity, could have been a demon, could have been an alien,

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 because it could have been a whole sort of things, right?

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 It was just appearing as a Shadow Man, could have been a Jinn.

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Who knows, but in a normal story, normal story involving a seven-foot tall shadow entity,

205
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 the gang is united.

206
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 They're all running together to get out of there.

207
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 This one shows that this creature was able to influence

208
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 another human to work with him.

209
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I mean, he didn't say, like, he wasn't like, well, Mike did hang out with a lot of Shadow people growing up,

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 and he is part of that community.

211
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 No, this guy was alien to both of them, but he was able to control Mike.

212
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 He was able to make Mike block the exit.

213
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's a really, really creepy story if you think about it,

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 because it shows that maybe there's not safety in numbers.

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Maybe you're better off alone, like Alice DJ once said.

216
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 My thing is, is that when you go ghost hunting alone,

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 there's two things you have to, there's multiple things you've got to worry about,

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 but only one of those is ghosts.

219
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Only one of those is Shadow Man controlling your friends.

220
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I know when I went ghost hunting, I was more concerned with hobos and wild dogs

221
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and falling into creeks or rivers and things like that.

222
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And then ghosts.

223
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I was there to, like, explore the ghost and to try to examine that stuff,

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 but we always came armed, and we always had,

225
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 we didn't have a lot of cell phones back then,

226
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 but, you know, we tried to have at least one cell phone,

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 and when I first started ghost hunting, we had no cell phones, but...

228
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Yeah, I mean, you have to worry about more terrestrial dangers.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But you also got to worry about the ghosts.

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 But yeah, creepy story, because you think how many times you're chilling with your buddies,

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 you think everything's going good.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 These guys weren't even looking for ghosts.

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 These guys were just smoking cigarettes in an alleyway.

234
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Imagine if they did go to some desolate location,

235
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 some abandoned farmhouse in BFE, Idaho,

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 and this happened, right?

237
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 There's no alleyway to run out of.

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You're, like, running through miles and miles of cornfield,

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 as all of your friends are singing "Ring around the road,"

240
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 singing they're, like, grabbing your shirt and trying to hold you down,

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 shove corn into your pants as this giant entity is coming towards you.

242
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Like, maybe the moral of the story is,

243
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 if you're going to go to an abandoned place, do it all alone,

244
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 and maybe not tell anyone, because there's a chance that if you tell them where you're going,

245
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 the ghost will call them up at their houses and say,

246
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 "Party at the abandoned farmhouse!"

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 They'll be like, "Oh, I love parties."

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And they go out there, and then they ring around the Rosie U anyway.

249
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So maybe the moral of the story is, don't have friends.

250
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Creepy, though. A really, really creepy story.

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Chime, Chilly, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Carbnercopter,

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 where we're waving goodbye to Carter and Mike,

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 and we see the shadow person singing up behind him.

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 We're like, "Oh, I'm sure they'll be okay."

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Chime, Chilly, go ahead and take us out of here.

256
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 We're headed all the way out to...

257
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Oh, we're headed back to Texas.

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 [imitates Texas accent]

259
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I think going back, I think we're going to realize that Season 17 was the Texas season.

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I don't know why we're here so much, but we're here a lot.

261
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And this story, they've been all really good Texas stories.

262
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I mean, the first one in this episode was a downer,

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 but we've been there a lot, and we've gotten a lot of good stuff from it,

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 and this is no exception.

265
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Specifically, we're headed to the Los Chisos Mountains.

266
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 In Texas.

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 That's within the Big Bend National Park.

268
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So, [imitates Texas accent]

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Helicopter's flying over the mountain range,

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 and we see all these trees and stuff like that.

271
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 There's an owl looking at us all mean, because we woke him up.

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 He's like, "Oh, I'll get you."

273
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 We're flying by.

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And Chisos, if it is pronounced correctly,

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Chisos is actually a local native tribe's word for ghost or spirit.

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So, the Los Chisos Mountains would be the ghost mountains.

277
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And it actually lives up to its name.

278
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 There's a lot of ghost sightings in this area,

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 but we're here for one ghost in particular,

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 1891.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It's the year the story takes place, and the name of the ghost.

282
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Oddly enough.

283
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 In 1891, there are two cowboys.

284
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 [imitates cowboys]

285
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 They're walking through one guy's like,

286
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 "Writing his cowboy horse."

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And that's Henry Pau.

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And then there's another cowboy, and he's like practicing with his guns.

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 [imitates cowboys]

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And that's Fine Gillian.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Now, these two cowboys, they've lived in this area for a long time.

292
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 They know each other, but they are starting to have this huge argument.

293
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And it's gonna get really bad soon.

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Because there's this bull that keeps grazing near their herds.

295
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Every so often, Henry's looking out at the distance.

296
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 He's like, "Ah, there's that bull I love so much,

297
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 but I don't know if it's mine. I don't really recognize it,

298
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 but maybe I'll just take it, because that's a strong looking bull."

299
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And then Fine's doing the same thing.

300
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 He's sitting on his ranch drinking some sassaparilla,

301
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 and he goes, "Oh, there's that bull again.

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 It's weird. He's right on the border of my land,

303
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 in that rascal Pau, Henry Pau,

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 but I'm sure that's my bull, even though I never bought it.

305
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Even though I don't know who it belongs to, it's on my land enough,

306
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I'm just gonna take ownership of it."

307
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And they actually start getting in a heated argument over whose bull this is.

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So Pau goes, "You know what? Screw this.

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 There's only one way to solve an argument in 1891."

310
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He goes back home, and he gets his gun.

311
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Now, Pau is a one-armed Civil War veteran.

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Doesn't say what side he was on, just so you guys know.

313
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He could have been a sub-unner. He could have been fighting against the United States,

314
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 but anyway, so Pau comes back, he has his gun, and he starts shooting at Fine.

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 [gun shot]

316
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And Fine, you know, this is 1891.

317
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 If you live in the middle of nowhere, you know how to use a gun, and he has a gun.

318
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You have to have a gun, too.

319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He grabs his rifle, and he starts shooting at Henry.

320
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 [gun shot]

321
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And this goes back and forth.

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 The distance is closing between these two guys.

323
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 They're walking towards each other, and they're shooting at each other,

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and eventually Pau's gun, his little revolver, gets jammed.

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Click, click, click.

326
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Well, Fine. [laughs]

327
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Yes, the day is yours, my friend.

328
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I guess you're right. That mighty bull is yours.

329
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And Fine, a man not to leave business unattended,

330
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 he walks up to Henry with this rifle, raises it, it's point blank to Henry's chest,

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and he pulls the trigger.

332
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 [gun shot]

333
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 One armed Civil War veteran with a jammed pistol is now sprawling out in the Texas sand,

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 blood soaking the soil, a large bull, [gun shot]

335
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 chewing the grass, watching the whole thing.

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Fine, even though he's this businessman, even though he owns all this land, right?

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 He killed a man.

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 He's now a criminal, no matter where his life was before that he's now a criminal.

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Texas Rangers go after him, and they catch up to him a week later,

340
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and there's a shootout, and Fine is killed by the Texas Rangers

341
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 in some God-forsaken canyon in Big Bend National Park.

342
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 The bull continued to graze all over this area.

343
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It went where it wanted, and even though both people wanted it,

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 because it was such a magnificent bull, the two people who were arguing over it died.

345
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And now, nobody in town wanted it.

346
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Like, they're like, "Free bull, anyone want to get this bull?"

347
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Because otherwise it's just this wild bull running around, who wants it?

348
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Nobody in town wanted the bull, none of the relatives of the two deceased people wanted the bull.

349
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But what they did, so apparently, I don't know why they just didn't go,

350
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 "Okay, we'll just kill the bull."

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I mean, maybe bulls were super rare back then, maybe they were like Pokemon.

352
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They didn't kill the bull. They branded the bull.

353
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 They had to put a brand on it to make sure that there were no other arguments over this bull.

354
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So they branded it with... This is a true story, by the way.

355
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 This is what's so interesting about this.

356
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 There's a lot of historical proof that this story happened.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They branded it with a brand that said "Murderer 1891."

358
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So that's how this bull became known in the area.

359
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It was called "Murderer 1891."

360
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And they just let it go.

361
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 So all of that stuff is true.

362
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 We have those two gentlemen, they killed each other over this bull.

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 The bull was branded "Murderer 1891."

364
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 What happens next is where we start to get into the world, or the paranormal,

365
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 the world of what is true, what is legend.

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But nonetheless, very, very interesting tale that we're going to be talking about.

367
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 What happens is where fine jillion used to hang out around town,

368
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 you'd be hanging out in the saloon, shooting back whiskey as some hot showgirl sitting on your lap,

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 you're holding five aces in your hand, all the stereotypes in one.

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I'm a winner.

371
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And you would see this bull walk through town.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Now you knew it was the bull, right?

373
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Because it had this huge brand on it, "Murderer 1891."

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It also started to show up where Henry Powell's son was known to frequent.

375
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So he'd be sitting there at home drinking whiskey, showgirl on his lap, six aces in his hand.

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Look out the window, you'd see "Murderer 1891" walk by.

377
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It did show up at another local saloon in Alpine, Texas,

378
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 so even in other towns you started to see this "Murderer 1891."

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And people started to put something together.

380
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 People started to figure this out.

381
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The guy sitting there, shooting back whiskey with a showgirl on his lap with a five aces at our first saloon,

382
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 he looks out and he sees the bull.

383
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 That's weird, right?

384
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But I should pay attention to my hand, and all of a sudden someone goes, "Ah, you cheat! I saw you had five aces there!"

385
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And that's my wife! That showgirl's my wife!

386
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Shoot out what happened in the saloon.

387
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 The place where Henry Powell's son hang out, you'd have a ranch hand sitting there working on something,

388
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 and this bull would kind of mosey on through the area, and the work hand would kind of look over and go,

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Oh, that's that spooky bull I've heard so much about."

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Turns back and then he sees another ranch hand kind of just stand in there,

391
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 "Get back to work! What are you doing just standing there?"

392
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 "Whoa, dude, this is my break! This is my break!"

393
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 "No, you get to work!" And they'd start fighting.

394
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 A violent fight would break out on the farm.

395
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "Get away, boy! Separate, separate!"

396
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 The saloon and alpine.

397
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 The bull would mosey on by.

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 The guy would be sweeping up the dirt.

399
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 It's a very hard job sweeping up the dirt off the ground,

400
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 and then he sees some drunk walking through town, and he goes,

401
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 "You know what? They're just ruining the city. They're making it all super dirty!"

402
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 "I'll show him what's what."

403
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And drops the broom, goes in, retrieves a sawed-off shotgun, places it against the bum's head,

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 *makes noise* beg for coins in hell.

405
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 For 30 years, whenever this bull showed up,

406
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 homicidal violence ensued.

407
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 If you saw this creature, it turned you into a cold, blooded killer.

408
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So you start having all of these just normal people just wig out,

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 *makes noise* blastin' dudes, choppin' people's heads off.

410
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I don't know if they were building saw traps, someone's trapped in a giant piano,

411
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 they're like, "Every time he plays the eighth note, your feet catch on fire!"

412
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I don't know how inventive they got him in, and I don't know what the eighth note is.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 But anyways, the point is, is like, when you saw this bull, it was going down,

414
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and super violent stuff was going to happen.

415
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 So people are like, "Well, we better catch this bull, right?"

416
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 "We better catch this bull."

417
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I mean, who wants to go purposely find something that drives you insane?

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 But otherwise, it's just walking through town, it's making everyone go nuts.

419
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 So they spent years trying to catch this bull, and they never could.

420
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It just kept appearing, kept causing this random mayhem, and it would disappear.

421
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Some say to this day, you can still see Murderer 1891.

422
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Walking through the Los Chinos Mountains.

423
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 This bull, Murderer 1891, still emblazoned on its hide,

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 walking through the areas that it used to haunt, literally, right?

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 They say that Murderer 1891 is responsible for up to 200 murders in the Big Bend area over the years.

426
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And the question is, is that number accurate?

427
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Is it exaggerated?

428
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Or, does the number keep on growing to this day?

429
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 You know, it's funny when I sat down to record this episode today,

430
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 it was just kind of throwing stories together.

431
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 You're like, "Wait, Jason, what? This isn't a professionally produced podcast?"

432
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 "You don't have a team of people behind you and everything's not perfectly crafted?"

433
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 No. I know, it's shocking, right?

434
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And it's funny, as I was finishing up the second story, and I was moving in this one,

435
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I go, "Wait a sec, these actually have something in common."

436
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And I didn't plan on this, but I like the way that it turned out.

437
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Humans being controlled by entities.

438
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I mean, one is clearly like a ghost,

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 and the other one may be a ghost or a shadow man or an alien or a demon or something else, right?

440
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 The shadow men are kind of their own box, and we don't really know what they are.

441
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We've done a lot of episodes on shadow men, and there's a ton of theories.

442
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The bull is just kind of a ghost bull.

443
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But then you start to think of, it's funny, this story, obviously, it would be a ghost today,

444
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 but we don't even know where the bull came from in the first place.

445
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Maybe it was an alien bull, maybe it was a gen.

446
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 We don't know for sure, but I think the common belief is that it is some sort of ghost,

447
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 as of now, some sort of ghost bull.

448
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 But both of these stories are really about the same thing, about losing control.

449
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 One of them is you're blocking your buddy, and maybe, hopefully, he gets attacked by this shadow man,

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 which in retrospect would be kind of funny, right?

451
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 If you just saw him get like beat up by a shadow man, and nothing serious happened, that would be hilarious.

452
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 The second one, the second one, people die.

453
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Just seeing this thing turns you into a homicidal maniac.

454
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 That's creepy, and I talk about it all the time, the show, the fear of losing control, the fear of snapping.

455
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 In 1891, in Texas, I'm sure, it was a really stressful time anyways.

456
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 But it had to do with a ghost that drives you even more stressed out, drives you insane,

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 turns you into a homicidal maniac.

458
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 That's even worse, and it's just, it's creepy to think that there are things like this out there.

459
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Now, this is not the norm when we look at the world of the paranormal,

460
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 and this is what I love about these two stories actually together, is that normally,

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 the majority of paranormal events are completely, I just see something weird and I can't explain it,

462
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 whether that's a UFO in the sky or a ghost floating down the hallway.

463
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Then you have a smaller subset of them interacting with us, alien abductions, poltergeist encounters,

464
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and then you have an even smaller, smaller, smaller section where you're looking at,

465
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 affecting us in a way that destroys our lives, demonic possession, and this type of thing.

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It's super rare when we come across stories where the paranormal affects you on a level that you die, right?

467
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And there's very, very, very, very few stories like this.

468
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I'm actually surprised, it seems like they're quite common because I covered two of them on the same episode

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 where people are getting influenced by these entities, but even then, the first one was just a guy kind of being a jerk,

470
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 kind of like blocking away, and then this one was, you see this thing, you become a murderer.

471
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Creepy. Creepy story, and we don't know what caused it, we don't know if the bowl was sent as some sort of curse in the first place.

472
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Who knows, but whatever it is, whatever its origin story is, it's a curse now.

473
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Being a paranormal investigator is very dangerous for a multitude of reasons.

474
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 One of them is the homos and the dogs.

475
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 When you're going ghost hunting, you have to be worried about all this stuff.

476
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Maybe there's some drug dealers using this abandonous insane asylum as their hideout.

477
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I mean, apparently they're working for the Joker, but you know what I mean?

478
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 You don't know.

479
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 You could go walking through the woods trying to find a sacred fairy circle,

480
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 and they're actually growing weed out there, and you get your hands chopped off by a member of a cartel.

481
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Right now, you don't want your ghost hunting story to end that way.

482
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 So we have those type of dangers then when it comes to paranormal, but then we also have knowing too much.

483
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I talked about that on Monday's episode as well, about how my dad, when he was going to seminary,

484
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 he was told every year, one or two of these young ministers get two into the demonology.

485
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And the college actually had a program set up to identify when that was going on.

486
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 They're all floating down the hallways.

487
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 They're like, "Hey, old hail, the dark one."

488
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 They're like, "You might want to come to my office hours, Johnny."

489
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 They had a program set up to identify them before they slid too far into that world.

490
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So knowing too much can be dangerous.

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Seeing too much can be dangerous.

492
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 There's all these dangers you have when you're dealing with the paranormal world.

493
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It can.

494
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 If someone of a weak psyche, someone of a weak constitution, it could really mess with you.

495
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It could really, really mess with you.

496
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And then you have the public ridicule as well.

497
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 I openly identify myself as a paranormal researcher.

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And people laugh, right?

499
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And then I'm floating down the hallways and I'm like, "Dark one, take out my enemies, please."

500
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 No, you know, I'm like, my whole thing is I don't care whether or not you believe it.

501
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I do it. I think it's fun.

502
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I believe it. Not all of it, right?

503
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I investigate it and it turns out to be real, but you know, whatever.

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 But if you have a weak sense of self and people are making fun of you,

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 people making fun of you online, posting stuff about you, stuff like that,

506
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 that can really hurt you.

507
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 That can really, really hurt you.

508
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And that can devastate you as well, destroys your sense of self.

509
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 So that's something you have to be aware of.

510
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 This is something completely different, right?

511
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 This is a ghost.

512
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 This is like a normal ghost that makes you kill people.

513
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 This isn't forbidden knowledge.

514
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 This isn't something you weren't meant to see.

515
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 This isn't a cursed set of words or a cursed coin that drives you insane.

516
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 And Monday's episode or any of that stuff, this is a ghost that makes you murder people.

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And you don't have to go looking for this.

518
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 This isn't happening in some abandoned mausoleum in Spain

519
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 that no one's been to for the past 400 years.

520
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 This isn't a national park.

521
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 This isn't an area where people go and you could be camping, you could be backpacking.

522
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I don't know if there's actually cities where these places used to be,

523
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 where there are now, there's many cities in the national park,

524
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 but I don't know how populated the area is because we started going to Alpine, Texas, and things like that.

525
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 You don't have to hunt this ghost.

526
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 It hunts you.

527
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And that brings it to a whole new level of terrifying.

528
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Basically, this ghost has a curse.

529
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And whether or not you go out seeking the curse, the lore is full of cursed treasures, right?

530
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Especially in the Southwest, some conquistadors buried in empires worth the gold.

531
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And now if you go seeking that gold, you die.

532
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 There's a lot of legends like that in the Southwest.

533
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 We'll be covering one or two this season.

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 We've covered them before as well.

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 This one you could be sleeping in your tent with your family.

536
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 This isn't in the brochure when you go out to Big Ben National Park,

537
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 when you go out there like, beware of Murderer 1891, you may slaughter your family.

538
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 They don't tell anyone. This is a local legend.

539
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 They may say it's not even true.

540
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 The bowl existed, but these 200 murders, we weren't able to find any news articles showing 200 people died.

541
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 So the park rangers don't mention it to you.

542
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And you're sitting there in your tent and you're like, good night, honey, good night, kids,

543
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 and you all fall asleep.

544
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And that night you hear, "Oooh."

545
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 It's not your wife snoring. She doesn't have COPD.

546
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 It sounds like there's a bowl walking around outside your tent.

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You're terrified.

548
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 So you slightly unzip the little fold in your tent and you look out.

549
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And sure enough, you see about 30 feet away, there's a bowl standing there in the pitch black darkness of this forest.

550
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 And you're staring at it.

551
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And you're hoping it doesn't notice you.

552
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And it doesn't. It's just kind of standing there eating some shrubs.

553
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And it walks off.

554
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And you go, "What? I never saw a bowl in the forest."

555
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Also, I better change my pants because that was terrifying.

556
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 But as you're laying there in your tent,

557
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 trying to figure out if you should wake up your wife and be like, "Hey, honey, there's a bowl outside."

558
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Other thoughts begin to cross your mind.

559
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You look at your wife.

560
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Dark thoughts begin to cross your mind.

561
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 You look at your children.

562
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Evil thoughts begin to cross your mind.

563
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And by the time the park rangers discover your tent,

564
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 three days later,

565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 ripped to shreds,

566
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 coated with clumps of dried blood,

567
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 matted hair,

568
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 and bone fragments,

569
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 you are long gone,

570
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 walking naked through the wilderness of Big Bend National Park,

571
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 holding a crowbar,

572
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 eyes wide and wild,

573
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 looking for another victim,

574
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 hoping for an entire campsite of innocent souls

575
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 to smash into pieces.

576
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 You thought you were just going on a nice camping trip with your family.

577
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Instead, you became the latest victim

578
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 of a ghastly bull,

579
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 known as Murderer 1891.

580
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 You will kill until you are killed.

581
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 That is the curse.

582
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 That is your fate.

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
