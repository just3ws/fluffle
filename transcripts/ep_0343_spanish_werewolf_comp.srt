1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 What happens when a country's mythology goes rogue?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,300
 And then we're headed back to Spain for part two of our fat extractor's series.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,800
 Spain seems to have a problem with people who eat human fat.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
 And today we're gonna take a look at a serial killer who did just that.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,000
 But, he did it while he was a werewolf today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 [Music]

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 I'm super sore. You know, so today was jujitsu day.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 I'm still a noob. I'm still a little baby. A little baby jujitsu person.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 So while they were all doing moves, getting each other in headlocks, rolling around on the ground,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
 I was falling down on my butt. I have to do a bunch of things where I fall down and then get back up.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 And it's called a technical standup.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 Technical... technical something.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Getting back up. And then I had to do a thing called the shrimp, which is what it sounds like.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 You lay on your back and then you bridge your hips, turn to your side, curl up like a shrimp, and move your body.

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 Now, you're like Jason. That's... that's ridiculous.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 You're a grown man. You're 43 years old. Why are you pretending to be a shrimp on a Tuesday morning?

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 Listen, guys, my body soar. It's going to be even worse tomorrow.

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 All I did was drill today. For a half hour, I did falls and technical standups.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,000
 And then the other half hour, I shrimped across the floor.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,500
 My body is already sore. I can just imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow.

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 The reason why I'm sharing this story with you guys is,

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 three weeks ago, I thought shrimp was something you eat. It is still something you eat,

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 but I'm learning these things. I'm doing stuff with my body that I never thought about doing.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,000
 And as I was squirming across the floor, pretending to be a shrimp, I had a huge smile on my face.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,500
 I knew I was going to be sore. I knew I was pushing my body in ways that was making it hurt now and going to hurt in the future.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 But, guys, do something different this month.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,000
 December. Not November. It's almost then. That's my challenge to you guys.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Let's all do something different before the end of the year.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Don't wait for New Year's resolution. Whatever it is, just do something different.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 A hobby you've thought about looking into. Do something different in the month of December.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Let's call it different December. Do something that you wouldn't have done otherwise.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Healthy. Don't be like, "I've always wanted to do heroin."

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Don't do that, but find something and let's do it together. That sounded wrong.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Let's go ahead, though. We are going... The inspirational speech is done.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We are headed out to start our episode. We are going to East Timor.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 East Timor. What time is it, you ask? The beginning of time.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Huh? Didn't expect that.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So we are not going back in time to the 1400s or the 1100s. We are going back to the nothing hundreds.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The world is...Pangia. It's just a big old bunch of stuff.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Don't have specifics, because this is a creation myth. So there is some weird stuff going on.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 There is a tiny little crocodile living in a swamp. And he's like, "Ugh. There is not a lot of food here."

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Well, there is a lot of food here, but there is not enough for me to get big and strong like I know I should be.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I'm going to go to the ocean and eat giant fish. So the crocodile starts leaving the swamp.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But before he reaches the ocean, starts to dry out and he's like, "Ugh. This was a poorly planned idea."

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Jason told me to do something different and here I am, dying. Damn you, Jason!

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But as he's waving his little clawed hand in the air at me, a boy walks by and goes, "Who's Jason?"

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And why are you so far away from any source of water? And the crocodile goes, "If you take me to the ocean, I'll do whatever you want. I'll repay you."

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 The boy's like, "Okay. That sounds like a fair deal." First off, ah! Talking crocodile! Secondly, it sounds like a fair deal.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 He picks the crocodile up, takes him to the ocean. The crocodile goes, "Thank you."

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And swims away and begins to eat all aquatic life it can come across. Definitely an alpha predator.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And now it's just eating Nemo. It's eating the little mermaid. It's eating through all of the Disney classics.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It's eating frozen somehow. But eventually it gets massive. It's this massive crocodile that's now swimming through the ocean.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 One day the boy stands on the shore and he goes, "Hey, crocodile! Crocodile! Crocodile!"

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I don't know. Does they can't? Okay, here's an interesting question. You yell in a cave at echoes.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You yell in a canyon at echoes. And I understand it's like your voice bouncing off the walls.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 It's like the sound waves hitting the walls and coming back. I think that's how echoes work, right?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You say something and your voice makes a sound wave and then it hits a wall and then bounces.

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Is that how it happens? How does an echo work? Here's my question.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Considering I don't really know how echoes work. If you yell at it, let's assume that echoes work the way I think they do.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's your voice bouncing off the walls because you don't echo in the middle of nowhere.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 You don't echo if you're in the plains. But can you echo in a forest because your voice is bouncing off trees?

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 My question is, this is my question. If you yelled at the ocean and the waves are really big, would you hear an echo?

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Now, okay, I know you're saying if the waves are really big you won't be able to even hear your own voice.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Theoretically, if the waves made no noise, would you hear an echo from it bouncing off the waves?

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Or would your voice go through the water? And actually that's interesting because I know for a fact that your voice travels more well over water

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 and also interrupts your grammar, makes you have bad grammar. Anyways, so the big crocodile comes back to the boy and goes, "What do you want?"

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And the boy's like, "That's a little rude. I only saved your life, jerk."

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The crocodile's like, "Sorry, sorry. What do you want? I mean, here, I'll help you out."

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So the boy goes, "I want to sail around the world."

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 The crocodile and the boy go all around the world and eventually after a couple years the crocodile goes, "That was a fun adventure, but I got to die now."

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Like, you've roamed me until I died of old age. But then he says this. This is a quote from the crocodile,

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 "In memory of your kindness, I will turn myself into a beautiful island where you and your children can live until the sun sinks in the sea."

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And he dies. And he, the crocodile actually becomes East Timor. It is a giant island somewhere near Australia.

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So that is the creation myth for how the island came to be.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now, obviously it's one of those creation myths that would be really easy to debunk. Just keep digging.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 If you never hit alligator guts, I'm sorry, crocodile guts, you know that you're an atheist.

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 You know that the crocodile didn't really turn into the island.

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 But, so on East Timor they believe that crocodiles are their benefactors. There is this thing, here's a quote from the creation myth as well.

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 It says, "Now when the people of East Timor swim in the ocean, they enter the water saying, 'Don't eat me crocodile, I am your relative.'"

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So they have a bond with the crocodile.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Now that story all took place at the beginning of time. And they really do say, "Don't eat me crocodile, I am your relative."

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Now let's fast forward to 2019 where crocodile attacks are astronomically high.

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Now, right now they're at one a month and you're like, "That's not too bad."

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's actually, it's now like five times, you're five times more likely in East Timor to get attacked by a crocodile than you are to contract malaria, which was originally their number one problem over there.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And they're thinking, the logic is this, they're getting one attack, a crocodile attack a month. It used to be one a year.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And sometimes there's two or three crocodile attacks. Now here's the thing, because the people of East Timor consider crocodiles to be their relatives, to be, there's temples all over for crocodiles.

90
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 They consider it a bad omen or that you've sinned if a crocodile attacks you. People are thinking there's actually more crocodile attacks and people are just covering it up.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They're like, "Hey Sal, what happened to your legs? I ran into a doorknob. Did the doorknob have 20 teeth?" Yeah, it was a fancy doorknob.

92
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I mean, their legs just shredded. They think people are covering up their crocodile attacks. People are walking around missing an arm.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 "No, no, I wasn't born with an arm." They're like, "Why are you bleeding so much?" "Why are you asking so many questions?"

94
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So, people are getting this, the article that I read from, it starts off with this woman, she's got attacked by a crocodile and she got away and then she turned and four crocodiles ate a child right in front of her.

95
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I mean, it's a serious problem. And what makes it even weirder is the people of the island are like, "Those aren't our crocodiles."

96
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Are crocodiles from East Timor or are descendants or ancestors, whichever way, their family, these have to be crocodiles coming from somewhere else.

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So, they've actually started this whole study where crocodiles apparently can't swim across the ocean because they're just these massive creatures.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And so, people are like, "Listen, I know these crocodiles. I was raised by these crocodiles. I went to school with these crocodiles. Damn it. It's not our crocodiles."

99
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So, what's happening is they're finding me because you can't hurt them either. It's a cultural thing.

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 If a crocodile eats a baby, you can't then just bash the crocodiles head in. It is like a deity.

101
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It'd be the equivalent of if your uncle ate your baby. Well, technically, you probably could bash in your uncle's head, but generally, no, I guess that is what you would do if your uncle...

102
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 First off, you'd wonder, "Why did you eat my baby?" But there's laws and stuff. But I guess not always. I guess for the most part, we do bash in people's heads if they eat babies.

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But it would be worse to attack a crocodile than it would be to attack a murderer because it's like a... Your uncle might have eaten your baby, but your uncle didn't grow to be 10 miles long, die in the ocean, and become an island.

104
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 So, that's the difference. The crocodiles are responsible for the birth of your people. Your uncle is just somebody who is related to your mom.

105
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Big difference. Big difference. One is an island and the other one is just a dude. Both ate babies, though.

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So, the scientists are like, "They're not our crocodiles." So, as they're catching these crocodiles, they're testing them to see if they're coming from Australia or anywhere else.

107
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And every test they've run so far has said, "No, these are local crocodiles." All the crocodiles that they have found are local.

108
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And it was weird, the scientists goes, "That's not proof. We gotta keep testing these crocodiles because eventually we'll find an Australian one and then we'll know the truth."

109
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So, they're just gonna keep testing these until they find an interloper and then blame all the attacks on them.

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But, yeah, weird story. Crocodile attacks on the rise, people denying that it's local crocodiles. It must be immigrant crocodiles.

111
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And you can't do anything about it. Otherwise, you're basically beating up a god. Which, to be fair, would be kind of dope.

112
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You know what, I should do a YouTube series. I should do a YouTube series where I travel around the world and beat up sacred animals.

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So, of course, you go to India and you're like, "Rustle a cow." First off, let's assume that I'm able to fight any of these creatures because I think a cow would wreck me.

114
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I think a human fighting a cow, like, barehanded. Like, if you got put, not a bull, but a straight up, like, dairy cow, those things are huge.

115
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And what you would do to make the fight interesting is you would, I would have to like, hide their young behind me or like, rub something on me that would make it seem like I ate their children.

116
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Something. Because otherwise the cow would just kind of hang out. But I could fight a cow in India. I could fight an alligator in East Team where this is a bad idea anyway.

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 This is shaving off to be a really bad idea. What would I, what other sacred animals are there?

118
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I'm sure somebody worships like a king, emperor, penguin or something like that. I'd love to fight one of those dudes. Like a giant penguin.

119
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And then, um, I'm sure I could find some colt in Greenland who like, worships a manatee. That would be the episode where I put on the scoop of suit and punch a manatee a bunch of times.

120
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 That'd be pretty awesome too. Sacred animal fights. That don't steal that idea.

121
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And actually speaking of, speaking of YouTube channels, guys, I had a vision. We, and I'm probably going to be talking about this quite a lot.

122
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We are on the precipice of this show really, really taking off. Really, really taking off.

123
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And what I need from you guys is to help get the word out. Yes, supporting the Patreon is awesome and I'm very thankful of that.

124
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Buying the merch is awesome and very thankful of that. But I really need you guys to help get the word out about the show.

125
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 If you go to deadrabbit.com you can download flyers to help put around your town, coffee shops, school campus.

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 If you're visiting home for the holidays, put them up there. If you can't do the flyers, just recommend the show to your friends and family.

127
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 That honestly does so much for the show and if you guys really want to keep supporting the show, that's the best way to do it.

128
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Let's go ahead though and I'm probably going to be doing a little 10 second ads like that for a while because I really, really want to grow this show.

129
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And I think you guys do too. But let's go ahead and move on to our last story for the night.

130
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Now our last story, we're headed to Spain. Let's say goodbye to the, we're leaving an arena where there's like a beat up emperor penguin with a little sling on his little wing.

131
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And a manatee is just like, and then what else did he beat up a cow? You guys are like, Jason, I'm not going to celebrate you.

132
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I'm not promoting your show. You just beat up a penguin. Then you asked me to put up flyers. You're a jerk. I'm like, no, no, no.

133
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 No, no, you put up the flyers before I beat up the penguin. This is all happening and this is not linear time.

134
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So anyways, thank you for putting up those flyers and penguins like tearing them down, penguins ripping them up.

135
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 We're leaving behind this arena of sacred animals that I fought. And we are going back to Spain. What is it with Spain?

136
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And you know what's funny is I said I have three episodes. So we did yesterday's episode was about fat extractors, kind of the quick overview.

137
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And I said I got three episodes. I actually have so much stories out of Spain about people eating fat or stealing fat.

138
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I don't even know what to do with all of them. And they're all just shockingly bizarre. But a quick overview for those of you who missed yesterday's episode.

139
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Spain has a problem. They have a lot of myths and legends about people who rip out human fat.

140
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 They're called sacramentecas, which means fat extractor. They actually have a word for it.

141
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 So the fact that if someone over here was scooping out people's fat, we would just say, oh, that's disgusting.

142
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And two, that's a fat extractor. Spain has such a problem with it, they have multiple names for it.

143
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 They have a fat extractor and then they have one other one. It's for someone who sells the fat.

144
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's actually a different occupation. But we're going to delve a little bit more into why they have--

145
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Well, actually, no, we're not because I can't figure out why they have such a problem with this, except for the fact that there have been multiple real-life serial killers who ripped the fat out of people.

146
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Now, here's the thing. Part of-- When they are talking about fat being ripped out, one of the things they're talking about is all of the intestines as well.

147
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So they have a problem not only with people eating fat, but with devouring intestines, ripping intestines out of the stomach.

148
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 If you happen to be eating sausages, I'd go ahead and put those down. I'd go ahead and just move those away.

149
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 If you happen to be eating beef stroganoff, pretty much anything involving meat-- Just put it away. Put it away.

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Because we're going to Spain. Let's take a look at a little man. And you're going to go like, that's kind of sending--

151
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 No, this man-- Well, first off, he deserves to be condescended to, but we're going to talk to this little man. We're not going to talk to him, actually. He's total lunatic.

152
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 We're going to meet a man named Manuel Blanco-Romasanta. So let's hop in the Carbentercopter. We're leaving behind the arena of broken animals. We're flying to Spain.

153
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 It's the mid-1850s, and Manuel Blanco-Romasanta is being led through town in handcuffs.

154
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He's been arrested for the murders of nine people, and the police are marching him to the police department.

155
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 They take him in, they throw him in a cell. [SPLAT]

156
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Shut the door on him. They're like, "Why'd you do it, Manuel? Why'd you do it?"

157
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He looks at him through the bars of the cell and goes, "I had no choice. It's what werewolves do."

158
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 The guards are like, "What?" The guys are like, "Yes, I'm a werewolf. Let me go back in time and tell you my origin story and fill you in on the story of Manuel the Werewolf."

159
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 True story, by the way, and the cops are like, "Of course it's a true story. We're living in a red-- [MIMICS SILENCE]

160
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Manuel, right, waves his hand, waves his paw, and teleports them back before they can protest anymore.

161
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 The year is 1809, and Manuel is born, and they take the little baby and they go, "Aww, I named the 'Manuela' because you're obviously a woman, a little baby girl."

162
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And for the first six years, Manuel was Manuela and was raised as a girl.

163
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And then when she turned six, the doctor goes, "Oooh, made a mistake. This is a dude. This is a little man."

164
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So they just changed this-- they took the 'A' off, which I guess is one of the best things about the Spanish language.

165
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You're like, "Oh, you're a boy now." Remove one letter. There you go.

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So then he became Manuel. Quite confusing.

167
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Now, it's weird because he apparently is a dude. He had a beard when he was arrested, but he was only between the height of 4'6" to 4'11".

168
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 So a tiny, tiny man. And he was described as "tender looking," which is gross.

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Which is gross for any adult to be listed as tender looking. Actually, for any human.

170
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I mean, that's what you describe hamburger meat. Anyway, it's tender looking.

171
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Now, he is actually Spain's first recorded serial killer.

172
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And this is all happening in the late 1800s. So before this, of course, there probably were serial killers, but nobody that they ever caught.

173
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Started off working as a dressmaker. Then he became a traveling salesman.

174
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And then he goes, "You know what? I really enjoy walking, and I know everywhere around Spain.

175
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I'm going to be a guide. I'm going to guide people over the hills and through the woods to Grandma's house if they want to go there.

176
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Maybe Teddy Bear Picnic somewhere, and I will guide them through all the wilderness.

177
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I will basically be Aragorn, but I'm also eating human fat in the future.

178
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 In 1844, some dude comes to Manuel to collect the debt. Manuel kills him. Now, that's a confirmed kill.

179
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And it wasn't like suspicious circumstances. This dude's head was bashed in. Manuel was the last person to see him alive.

180
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He leaves town. Now, he's actually tried in absentia for like involuntary manslaughter. Cops are looking for him. Can't find him.

181
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Now, he reemerges under a new name and a different province in Spain.

182
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 He's working as a cook. He's working as a weaver. It's interesting because he does a lot of jobs which would be considered feminine.

183
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Which makes me think that he might have been trying. And a lot of the men in town kind of mocked him for being a feminine.

184
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 So he might have, he was also married though to a woman. So it was just kind of a weird, like, he could have been trying to blend in as a woman as well.

185
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But I guess the beard would make it kind of difficult back then.

186
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 There was definitely this weird thing going on where on the one hand he was married to a woman and now a day, let me back up here.

187
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Nowadays, you have many men who are weavers and make dresses and stuff like that.

188
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But back in the 1800s Spain, it was definitely odd to have a man be a weaver or to make dresses.

189
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So anyways, he kind of worked his way into society where men considered him effeminate and women basically considered him not a threat.

190
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So when he started becoming a guide again in this new province, his main people that he was guiding through the wilderness were women and children.

191
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Very, very slight effeminate man who's going to be afraid of this dude.

192
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And what would happen was he would lead these women and children off into the woods over these hills going somewhere.

193
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And then the family, so they leave town A, town A, famous town in Spain, resort town, that's where all the kids go to do drugs.

194
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They leave town A and then they go to town B and then he would bring back a letter to town A being like, "Oh, your loved ones got to this town safely.

195
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Here's a letter. Shhh, proving that." And they're like, "Oh, that's really nice and it's really nice too. It's obviously in your handwriting.

196
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's so nice." He wrote it for them. He's like, "Yes, they dictated the letter to me."

197
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But over time, people started to get suspicious because people would go to town B and they would never return.

198
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Or you would then go and follow them at some point with a different guide and they wouldn't be there.

199
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Now at one point he gets suspected of killing these people.

200
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 For whatever reason, someone finally gets, what's the term, a stick in their crawl or a needle in their paw or something like that.

201
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 A stick in their crawl, I think it is. Anyway, somebody finally gets something somewhere and goes, "I think he's murdering these people."

202
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 And then this weird, again, it's something to do with Spain. This guide is leading people over the mountains.

203
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 People are not ending up where they're expected to be. Therefore, he's eating their fat. That is mixed in with the conspiracy.

204
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Also, they accuse him of ripping their fat out to make soap. Because what happens is he's going over the mountain and then coming back with really nice soap.

205
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Bars of soap. What? No, I've always had these bars of soap. They're like, "Why is one labeled woman and one labeled child?"

206
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 He's like, "Because this one's for a kid and this one's for a woman."

207
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 They're like, "Yeah, I guess that works." But he leads a family of four over. He comes back with four bars of soap.

208
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 They start to find suspicious he always has fancy soap with him. Really, really nice soap.

209
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And people are going missing. And he's in Spain where people assume that at any point, your next door neighbor starts eating your fat and using your fat to make soaps.

210
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Now, this is where the story gets super, super weird. You're like, "Jason, this is just a standard true crime."

211
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Dude, this story really trips me out. He gets arrested and he admits to the murders. He goes, "I killed nine people."

212
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 They go, "We're pretty sure you killed these nine people, this combination of this mother and this daughter and this mother and these two kids."

213
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yes, I killed nine people. I admit I took nine people out onto a trip and they died. And I killed them. I killed these nine people. I admit to it, I have to assuage my guilt.

214
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But it's because of the curse of the werewolf. We'll get to that in a second.

215
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So the police are like, "No, it tells about the werewolf curse now." But first, they go and they find the nine bodies.

216
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So he admits to nine murders. They find nine bodies out in the wilderness. This is what he says.

217
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I'm a werewolf. We'll get back to that. He says he's a werewolf. And here is his quote.

218
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 "The first time I transformed was in the mountains of Cuso. I came across two ferocious-looking wolves. I suddenly fell to the floor and began to feel convulsions.

219
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I rolled over three times and a few seconds later, I was a wolf.

220
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I was out marauding with the other two for five days until I returned to my own body, the one you see before you today, Your Honor.

221
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 The other two wolves came with me, who I thought were also wolves, changed into human form.

222
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 They were from Valencia. One was called Antonio and the other one Don Genaro. They two were cursed.

223
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 We attacked and ate a number of people because we were hungry."

224
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Oh, no, he didn't actually howl in the courtroom. But that was that he was actually telling the judge that. He's like, "Listen, I'm a werewolf.

225
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I saw a bunch of wolves. I saw two other wolves start rolling around on the ground and became a wolf. I ate a bunch of people."

226
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Now, the judge said, "Very, very, this is what anyone would say in this sort of situation. Turn into a werewolf now."

227
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Now, your answer could be, "Well, it's not a full moon or it's the middle of the day, or if you have a delicious baby, I could eat maybe."

228
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 But his answer was probably the best answer I've ever heard. He goes, "Well, Your Honor, I was cursed to be a werewolf for 13 years

229
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and the curse ended two weeks ago. So, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, womp-womp. I'm not a cursed as a werewolf anymore.

230
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 If you had arrested me two weeks ago, I would have easily turned into a werewolf in front of you, Your Honor.

231
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 But you didn't. So bully for you. I can't do it."

232
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Now, he's obviously found guilty because basically he's admitted to these nine murders and he can't turn into a werewolf.

233
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Not only can he not turn into a werewolf, it's the late 1800s. People are having a hard time believing in werewolves.

234
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But there's a belief that he might simply have some sort of mental illness like lycanthropy.

235
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 That's not mental illness, but you know, like turning into, getting all hairy and stuff like that, maybe he got bonked on the head and looked in the mirror,

236
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 he was hairy, started to run around and eat people. Who knows?

237
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Some of the people were saying that he was sane. He was just a brutal killer.

238
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 He just really wanted some fancy soap. He was ripping these people's intestines out.

239
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 He was eating their fat. And the fat he didn't eat was turning into soap.

240
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He's a sacramentteca. He's a mantequero, which means fat-seller.

241
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 This guy was just a psycho. He was just a disgusting man.

242
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 He sentenced to death. And what happens is a psychiatrist ends up going through his contacts and finally is able to talk to Queen Isabella the second

243
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and says, "I think this guy needs to be studied. I think he might actually have lycanthropy."

244
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I'm not saying that he can actually turn into a werewolf, but there might be something about this guy that should be...

245
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 We shouldn't kill him, basically. Let's not kill him, because I think we need to study his mental state.

246
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 It might help us learn more about weirdos and people who believe they're werewolves and stuff like that.

247
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And Queen Isabella the second was actually quite curious about this case. So she did. She had him commuted to life in prison.

248
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 But he ended up dying ten years later of stomach cancer.

249
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Now, some people say that he died because a guard at prison shot him. He wanted to see him turn into a werewolf.

250
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That doesn't really work.

251
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 "Hey, become a vampire." What? Blows brains out?

252
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Oh, I guess it didn't work. Like, you kind of got to give him some time, you know?

253
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Let him go out during the full moon. Maybe delicious baby can have him shift. Who knows?

254
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You just can't shoot a guy. Turn into a werewolf. Just blow his brains out.

255
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 But anyways, most likely, because there's not a lot of records for his death, the most commonly accepted thing is that he died of stomach cancer.

256
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Here's what trips me out about this story. This part is so weird.

257
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And I'm reading about this and it's totally glossed over. And I was like, "Wait, what?"

258
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I had to reread it a couple of times because there's no...

259
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 There's no way to explain this other than, really, there's two ways. And ones, they're both totally illogical.

260
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 He admitted to nine murders. But he was only convicted of five of them.

261
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So he goes in and he left with all of the people he took out on tour guides.

262
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Nine people didn't make it to their destination. He was the last person seen with them.

263
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 He says, "By name, I killed these nine people." And they were all people who left with him.

264
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 He showed them the locations, or told them the locations, of nine bodies.

265
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The authorities go out there. They find nine bodies.

266
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 He was only convicted of five murders.

267
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Why, you ask? Because five of them, they could tell that their heads were bashed in, or they were stabbed to death.

268
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And their guts, their intestines, are all ripped out.

269
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Five of them, they could tell, were actually murdered.

270
00:30:47,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 The other four bodies that left with him, that he admitted to, and that he showed them the locations of the bodies.

271
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 When the authorities got there, they said, "These people died of wolf attacks."

272
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 They were not murdered. They were not stabbed. They were not beaten.

273
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 These four bodies were eaten by wolves. Not after death. They were killed by a wolf.

274
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And this guy is not a werewolf. Werewolves don't exist.

275
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 The fact that he knew where these bodies were, that he was the last person to see them.

276
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But he didn't kill them, because he's not a werewolf. These people died of a wolf attack.

277
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 There's only two ways that this could... Because, again, it's not like he stumbled across these people.

278
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 He left a town with them, knew their names.

279
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 So if he'd been walking through the wilderness and saw a body attacked by a wolf and goes, "I'm going to take credit for that one, because I'm a werewolf."

280
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 It wasn't that. He was guiding these people out. There's only two options.

281
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 There's only two ways that he could have known where those bodies were at, and he walked with them.

282
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Either he let them get attacked by a wolf on purpose, and the wolf did not attack him four times, four separate incidents.

283
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 He was able to lead a body to a path where a wolf would attack them and would not attack him in turn, and then left the body there, and then admitted to that murder and not just said, "Oh, that guy just got attacked by a wolf. I didn't kill that woman. That was a wolf attack."

284
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 These bodies were unmolested after death. They were 100% wolf attacks killed by wolves. I have to keep setting that in.

285
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 The only other option is, if he leaves town with them, knows where the body is at, admits to the murder, but when the cops get there, they say this person was not murdered.

286
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 They were killed by a wolf. The only logical answer left is that Manuel was a werewolf, and he killed them in wolf form, because that's the only way everything makes sense.

287
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 He leaves town with them, he knows their name, he finds them in a location, he turns into a wolf, he kills them, he feels guilty for that murder, and considers that the same thing as when he bashed that other person open and ripped their intestines out.

288
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Was Manuel actually a werewolf? We'll never know.

289
00:33:44,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Most likely, logically, no. But it's the only way this story makes sense. I find it odd that this detail is so glossed over. But it kind of makes sense, because werewolves don't exist, right?

290
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Even when someone admits to a murder, multiple murders that only a wolf could have committed. Werewolves don't exist, right?

291
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:36,000
