1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 A woman trying to get some sleep is kept awake by an unsettling image.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,360
 And then we travel to India to take a look at the story of a dairy farmer who wanted

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,120
 to maximize his profits.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
 So he decided on a new type of livestock.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,400
 Humans.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:32,480
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,680
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the coming weekend.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,280
 It's only Wednesday but it's never too early to plan.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,120
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Devin Bracken.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
 Everyone give a round of applause to Devin Bracken.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,720
 Every vehicle we take Devin you are going to be in charge of.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
 If you can't support the Patreon that's fine too.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,960
 That also really really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,440
 Devin I'm gonna turn to you.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,920
 Give you a little chin up.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,840
 I'm gonna touch your chin with my fist.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
 Chin up Devin.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
 You're having a great day.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,280
 Devin I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,240
 We're gonna go up in the sky for a slow journey.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,800
 Shout to Scotland.

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,640
 The Durgable is flying over the Atlantic Ocean.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,280
 We see it underneath us because that's all there is the sea way out there but eventually

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,520
 we see a little island out in the Europe place.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
 We see a little island there.

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,920
 There's a bunch of islands but this one in particular is called Scotland.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,520
 We're gonna land in the town of Fife.

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,640
 It's September 1997.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,120
 There's a young woman laying in her bed.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,400
 She's trying to get some sleep right?

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
 Yeah a little blinky, a little warm milk next to her.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,640
 But none of those things will help considering what's about to happen.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,440
 She's sitting there in her bedroom and she sees materialized in front of her.

39
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,920
 The head of a dog is just floating there.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,360
 She says it floats across her bedroom the whole time with the mouth opening and closing.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,760
 Oh no.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,240
 She's watching this phantom head float across her bedroom and then just disappear.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
 That's the whole story, right?

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,240
 But that's one of those bizarre stories that is the imagery is so unsettling.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,880
 The imagery is so unsettling and it leaves you with so many more questions.

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,600
 How she'd been laying in her bed and great aliens appeared.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,120
 You could tap into the mythology of alien visitation, abductions, lost time, UFO, all

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
 of that stuff.

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,880
 It would make sense.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,440
 If she was laying in her bedroom and she heard something scuttle underneath her bed and

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:10,080
 she looked there and she saw an emaciated naked old man slowly fade from view.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,040
 You could chalk it up to a terrifying ghost story but a ghost story nonetheless.

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,960
 And first off you would make it so your bed didn't have anything underneath it.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,800
 You would knock the legs out or move, whichever is easier, or both.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,320
 But you could tap into the lore of ghosts, the phantoms, wraiths, things like that.

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:38,040
 A floating dog head that's slowly opening and closing its mouth making no noise whatsoever.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,000
 Moving across your room and then simply vanishing.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,080
 You might be able to tie it into ghosts but it's a bit of a stretch.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,680
 The idea of phantom dogs have been around for a long time but they're not dog heads.

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,320
 It's always the black dog that's walking around patrolling the cemetery, protecting the grave

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,120
 of their master, a cursed creature, things like that right?

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,280
 We actually have done stories about ghost dogs.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
 This is just the head of a dog floating around your bedroom.

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,240
 And because it's so unexpected, it amplifies the creepy factor.

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
 A haunted doll.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,040
 There's been tons of literature on haunted dolls.

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
 Weegee boards spinning out of control.

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,320
 All of these things while terrifying in their own right, there's a sense of safety because

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,920
 we can research and go "Oh, this has happened before."

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,160
 I've come across one other story like this doing this podcast.

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,760
 And I thought it was terrifying back then.

72
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,880
 That was one, I don't remember what the location was, but this couple was at a hotel and the

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,320
 head of a woman appeared floating in the hallway and it began screaming at them.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,760
 And then it slowly faded from view but the screaming remained and then the screaming

75
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,360
 sound faded as well.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,400
 And I said at that time, that's absolutely far more scary than if the woman had had its

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
 full body.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,560
 She's still screaming, right?

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,440
 But the idea of just the disembodied head being the phantom is more unsettling.

80
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,480
 But to have a dog's head floating around your house, again, even if there was tons of literature

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,280
 about floating dog heads, it would still be unsettling.

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,600
 But I can't think of another story that I've come across like this.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,520
 We've had phantom dogs and we've had heads floating down hallways.

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,560
 But again, they're only the one story I can think of off the top of my head.

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,800
 And the fact that it wasn't making any noise, the fact that even screaming is a type of expression,

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:55,840
 the idea of being trapped in a hell where you can't even cry out for help is far worse.

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,480
 A story that has no lore to back it up.

88
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 Could be a dream.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
 Could be made up.

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,880
 Or it could be an outlier in an already creepy world.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,360
 Just a reminder that although we may research the paranormal and the unexplained, there's

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:22,400
 always something else waiting to greet us behind that closed door of reality.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,200
 Very very very unsettling imagery in that one.

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
 Devin Devin is now hiding.

95
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 He's hiding in the dirgeable.

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
 I was like come on, no no no it's not super scary.

97
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,800
 He's like no I'm afraid of dogs anyways.

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 It's just a dog head.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,280
 Who's afraid of just dog heads?

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
 He's all me.

101
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,920
 Okay well sorry I should have warned you.

102
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,720
 When you supported the Patreon you may be on an episode with the floating dog head.

103
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,680
 Devin let's go ahead though and leave behind.

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,200
 We're gonna coke some out of the dead rabbit dirgeable.

105
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,440
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy we're gonna go for a ride now.

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,320
 You're gonna drive us out too.

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,360
 You need a medical supplies.

108
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,240
 There's a floating dog head chasing us.

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
 Hit the gas.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
 Hit the gas.

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,040
 Now horror hounds out there already know that you need a medical supplies actually a fictional

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
 business.

113
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,520
 It was the business where the movie Return of the Living Dead took place at.

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
 Great zombie movie.

115
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
 Return of the Living Dead is absolutely a brilliant movie.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
 It was written directed by Dan O'Bannon.

117
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,920
 He wrote the first Alien movie.

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
 I think he gets slept on a lot.

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,200
 I think Dan O'Bannon gets slept on a lot.

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
 A Return of the Living Dead is great.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,520
 One of those movies that you watch you enjoy it's a total 80s punk rock gore fest.

122
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,200
 There's so many great set pieces in the movie.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,640
 And it really was you had the dawn of the dead you had you know you had Night of the

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,360
 Living Dead dawn of the dead day of the dead.

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,680
 This movie was more fun.

126
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,200
 It wasn't taking itself so seriously.

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,600
 It wasn't trying to tell a social message.

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,700
 It was get away from zombies.

129
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,160
 This is the movie that started the brains that came from that movie.

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,460
 The George Romero movies were way more serious.

131
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,320
 And this one the zombies talk.

132
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,600
 And this one the zombies are unstoppable.

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,420
 If you cut off the hand the hand will chase you.

134
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,700
 The only way to destroy a zombie is to incinerate it.

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,000
 If you guys have not seen Return of the Living Dead do yourself a favor.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
 It is a great horror movie.

137
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,740
 I dare you not to smile and wince in that movie.

138
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,620
 Because some of the stuff is super gory and some of the scenes are just so spot on.

139
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
 Just funny.

140
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,380
 It's almost a perfect zombie movie.

141
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,220
 It's different than a lot of zombie movies you've seen but it is quite brilliant.

142
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,560
 And so this movie actually might have saved a bunch of people's lives.

143
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,460
 So not only is it an entertaining horror movie that the rabbit recommends a return of the

144
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
 living dead.

145
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,520
 It might actually save some lives.

146
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,800
 Huge fan of the movie myself.

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
 I remember I watched it as a kid.

148
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
 I watched it as an adult.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,880
 It looked too scary as a kid.

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,520
 I watched it and then I watched the director's commentary, Dan O'Bannon.

151
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,880
 There's a scene in the movie where the two guys working at Unita Medical Supplies are

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
 having a conversation.

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,920
 And what they do at Unita Medical Supplies is they sell body parts that like scientists,

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,720
 dissected, dogs and things like that.

155
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 Perfectly preserved.

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,540
 One of those becomes a zombie.

157
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,140
 It's a great movie.

158
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,820
 But they sell all these body parts and at one point Frank, who's the manager of this

159
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,780
 medical supply place, he tells the story.

160
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,340
 He goes, "You see the skeleton?

161
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,620
 You see the skull here?

162
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,380
 This is a real human skeleton."

163
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,980
 It's pretty crazy, huh?

164
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,340
 And the new employee, Freddie, is like, "Yeah, yeah, it's kind of weird.

165
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
 That's from a human."

166
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
 Frank goes, "Yeah."

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
 He goes, "And you know what's weird?

168
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,140
 We get these from India.

169
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,320
 Based on trade regulations, all human skeletons must come from India."

170
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
 Freddie's like, "Really?

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,160
 It's like, yeah, yeah, it's an international law.

172
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,480
 Now I got a question for you.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,040
 Look at these teeth on this skeleton.

174
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,600
 He's got all of them.

175
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
 Got all of the teeth.

176
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,840
 When's the last time you've known someone who died with all of their teeth?"

177
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,080
 He tells Freddie, "I think they got farms out in India.

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,420
 They raise humans and then kill them just to harvest their skeletons."

179
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
 Freddie's like, "Really?"

180
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,100
 And Frank's like, "Nah, I just mess with you."

181
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,540
 And then they go on and they continue off their journey.

182
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
 It's just a small piece of dialogue.

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,180
 It's maybe like two minutes long in this movie.

184
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,660
 Daniel Bannon, during the commentary, he tells the story.

185
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,580
 He goes, "So I wrote that in to the movie."

186
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,980
 He worked on Alien.

187
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,140
 He was the writer for Alien.

188
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:39,280
 He said that H.R. Geiger had these immaculate human skulls that he used for anatomy purposes

189
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,840
 to design the alien and things like that.

190
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,480
 That's when he learned this story.

191
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
 He learned that it is true.

192
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,080
 India had a had, being the operative word, had a law put in place that if you wanted

193
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,840
 to buy a human skeleton, it could only come from India.

194
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,720
 And it was an international law.

195
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,860
 They were able to be the number one, the only exporter of human skeletons.

196
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,780
 He goes, "I learned that from working with H.R. Geiger and I thought in my head, how

197
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,500
 often do people die with all their teeth?"

198
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,660
 It's super rare.

199
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,820
 These skeletons were perfect.

200
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,180
 So he wrote that scene into the movie.

201
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,020
 He wrote that scene where the guys are saying, "I bet you they harvest them."

202
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,940
 That movie came out in 1985.

203
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:30,760
 He goes on to explain in the commentary, "In 1986, India stopped exporting skeletons.

204
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,600
 They got out of the human remains business.

205
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,520
 And now you can buy human skeletons anywhere.

206
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
 Any country can ship them out."

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,960
 India said, "We don't want to be the ones who are doing it anymore.

208
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
 We're out of the business."

209
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,800
 Now, Dale Bannon says in the commentary, he goes, "I'm not saying for sure that this

210
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:56,400
 movie exposed the fact that they were breeding humans simply for their skeletons in a country

211
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,680
 where life was so cheap, but you could get $1,000 for a human skeleton.

212
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,120
 You basically had farms where you were raising people to be perfectly healthy because you

213
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
 couldn't have skeletons with missing teeth.

214
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,680
 You couldn't have skeletons with broken ribs, things like that.

215
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,260
 These were supposed to be in laboratories, in medical colleges.

216
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,760
 You would raise people specifically to harvest their skeleton when they were the age that

217
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
 was required."

218
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,220
 He says, "I'm not saying for a fact that India was doing this.

219
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,560
 I do find it very coincidental that I came out with my movie in August of 1985 and in

220
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,200
 1986 India stopped exporting skeletons.

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,120
 Nowadays actually, it's incredibly hard to get a real human skeleton.

222
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,760
 I don't remember where I read this.

223
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,380
 I remember researching this back at that time.

224
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,140
 But most skeletons nowadays are fake and if you want an authentic human skeleton, it

225
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,380
 has to be a skeleton that was exported 20 years ago.

226
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,180
 You buy it from Harvard and you buy it from this laboratory that already had it.

227
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,020
 It's very, very hard to get an actual human skeleton today because it is true.

228
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,900
 Most people don't die with all of their teeth.

229
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,820
 I don't have all of my teeth.

230
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,220
 I don't have a perfect skeleton.

231
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
 I mean, it's pretty dope.

232
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,040
 It gets me to where I'm going.

233
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 So did Dan O'Bannon actually destroy an illicit industry by telling a theory he had in this

234
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,800
 hit zombie movie?

235
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,320
 Was it just a coincidence?

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,080
 Devon, let's go ahead and hop in that carbon or copter.

237
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,640
 We're flying out to India because this isn't the first time allegations like this have

238
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,040
 happened.

239
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,160
 I actually got an email last year from Gary Foster.

240
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,440
 He's a longtime listener of the show.

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,460
 I actually don't know if he still listens to the show.

242
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,140
 It's been a long time since he sent me this story.

243
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,300
 I found it very interesting and it's always been in my want to do folder.

244
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,940
 Finally get around to it.

245
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,160
 Devon, we're bringing that carbon or copter nice and low over India.

246
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,740
 We're headed over to Garakpur.

247
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,980
 Devon, go ahead and land us at this dairy farm.

248
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,600
 It's the year 2008.

249
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 We're in Garakpur, India.

250
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,100
 So we're all jumping out of the carbon or copter.

251
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,420
 We have to cover it up with some camouflage.

252
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,520
 You might need to make a quick getaway.

253
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,080
 Devon gives us the thumbs up.

254
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,520
 You can't even see the helicopter.

255
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,960
 So hopefully we camouflaged it too much.

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,080
 We hope we don't have to run back in time.

257
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
 We're walking up to this dairy farm.

258
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,200
 Now back in 2008, there was a man named Papu Yadhaf.

259
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,720
 He was a dairy farmer in the area.

260
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,440
 He had these sheds, you know, like those silo sheds, the real cheap made of tin.

261
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,040
 He kept all of his cows in there.

262
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,980
 It was a dairy operation and the heat in this area was so oppressive.

263
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,260
 These cows weren't having the greatest time and they're dumb.

264
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,300
 They're dumb as a bag of bricks, right?

265
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,580
 But even they were miserable in these metal sheds.

266
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,780
 You know who else was miserable was Papu because he wanted more money.

267
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,340
 Who doesn't want more money?

268
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,740
 But not everyone will go to this extreme.

269
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,260
 In India, it's illegal to buy or sell blood.

270
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,460
 So like in America, you can donate your blood.

271
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,020
 You can donate your pl- for plasma, you can actually get more.

272
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
 You can donate money for it.

273
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,440
 You can donate blood to the Red Cross.

274
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,880
 But they'll pay you for your plasma in America.

275
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,560
 I believe they'll do that in other countries.

276
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,720
 But in India, they don't.

277
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,460
 The problem is, is that you have such a high population base that you need a lot of blood.

278
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,520
 And people have something that they know someone else wants.

279
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,080
 They want to charge money for it.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
 But legally, you can't.

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,320
 So there's a black market for human blood.

282
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,160
 If you need an operation, because they have such a problem with their blood supply over

283
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
 there.

284
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,140
 If you need an operation, you actually have to find a donor to donate blood.

285
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,420
 So let's say the operation is going to take five pints of blood.

286
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,340
 You have to get someone who will donate five pints of blood, or more likely five people

287
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,780
 who will donate a pint of blood.

288
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,940
 Because that way it'll balance off how much blood you need from the blood bank versus

289
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,100
 how much blood is going back into the blood bank.

290
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,020
 You have to offset your use of blood.

291
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,560
 Now I don't know what happens if you don't know.

292
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,000
 You show up at the hospital and you're like, "Oh, I thought I was only going to need two

293
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 pints of blood."

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And you're bleeding everywhere.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You're like, "Oh, I thought I was only going to need two pints of blood."

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
 And they're like, "Sorry, dude.

297
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 You needed three.

298
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,840
 So we're going to keep you on the edge of death until you can make a couple phone calls.

299
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,080
 Get someone down here."

300
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 You need to basically offset that balance.

301
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,480
 So you have a demand for it.

302
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,000
 There is a black market for blood.

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,280
 And Papu knows this and he goes, "Okay, what's the one type of people that everyone dislikes,

304
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,020
 except for drug dealers?

305
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,260
 Drug addicts."

306
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,460
 So he goes and he starts putting out, "I don't know if he's putting up flyers in the area."

307
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,340
 He's like, "Drug addicts."

308
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,220
 Then the rest of it was all blacked out and then his phone number.

309
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,260
 But he starts recruiting drug addicts to come to his farm where he will remove your blood.

310
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,660
 Remember, this is a dairy farm, by the way.

311
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,820
 And so you'd be laying next to a cow and the cow would be looking at you and you'd be hooked

312
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,460
 up to a machine.

313
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,600
 One bag has like a bag of milk in it and the other bag has your blood in it.

314
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
 He would pay you $3, the equivalent of $3 for a bag of blood.

315
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,400
 Now in India, the annual income is about $1,600 equivalent of US money.

316
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,680
 So getting paid $3, that's a bunch of money, dude.

317
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:20,960
 They said for $3 a drug addict can go, first off, he can pronounce it right, a drug addict

318
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
 would be able to be high for a couple days.

319
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,500
 $3 goes a long way.

320
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,060
 So you figure I'll give him a pint of my blood, I'll get $3, I'll go get high and

321
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,700
 then maybe I'll eventually sell it back.

322
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,620
 Now in America you have to wait 48 days between blood donation.

323
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,780
 But since you're already doing stuff illegally, you're not, Papu's not worried about that.

324
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,660
 He's like, "Now come back in 48 days."

325
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,860
 He's counting his money.

326
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,420
 He would pay these guys $3 for a pint.

327
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,900
 He would sell them for just common blood, just for like A positive.

328
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,500
 Just the normal blood, right?

329
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,160
 So he's already making a huge profit.

330
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,480
 If they happen to have some sort of weird, like let's say you were going to the hospital

331
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,680
 and you needed a special type for your half reptilian, you need that cane blood in you,

332
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,840
 you could get up to $120 a bag.

333
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,800
 So he, Papu, actually brings in a laboratory specialist so they can start testing the blood

334
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,360
 themselves so they can start setting the prices.

335
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 Originally they were selling it all for $20 a bag.

336
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,620
 Once you get a specialist then he can go, "Oh no, this is like A, B positive with a little

337
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,820
 bit of this extra stuff in it, a little bit of that secret sauce."

338
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,880
 So we can charge more money for him.

339
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,860
 Then he goes, "Okay, so I'm paying these drug addicts $3.

340
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,380
 Like first off I gotta find them.

341
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
 I gotta bring them here.

342
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,620
 I gotta pump blood out of them."

343
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,820
 And then they leave and then maybe I find them again or maybe they die of a drug overdose.

344
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,780
 So spending a lot of time finding people.

345
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,260
 I'm going to a lot of bus stops.

346
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,300
 I'm going to a lot of hop houses.

347
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,660
 I'm going all this stuff.

348
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,520
 Maybe a little idea.

349
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,760
 Little light bulb with devil horns appears over his head.

350
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,720
 He goes, "I got all of these sheds full of cows.

351
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,100
 What if I put all the cows in just a few of the sheds and then have these empty sheds

352
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,640
 and then put beds in those sheds and then I'll buy some handcuffs."

353
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,840
 So basically after he comes up with this completely evil plan he starts inviting the drug addicts

354
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 back to his place.

355
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,080
 He's like, "Hey, come over.

356
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,480
 You guys know the drill.

357
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,140
 Last time he came over I gave you three bucks.

358
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
 You got high for a while.

359
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,780
 We're going to do that again.

360
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,300
 But this time I'm going to give you a comfy bed to lay in."

361
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,820
 And they're like, "Oh, that's cool."

362
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,420
 And then they walk in there and there's basically handcuffed people in there and he would handcuff

363
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,820
 these guys, hook the IV into their arm and leave.

364
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:44,720
 Underneath the hot Indian sun in a tin shed were just rows of beds and these drug addicts

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,220
 slowly leaking into these blood bags, which is bad enough, right?

366
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,820
 But then you also figure a couple of them are withdrawing from their drugs.

367
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,700
 Also how is he selling bags of blood from drug addicts?

368
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,020
 They give it to some business man.

369
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,420
 They're like, "Oh, your operation was a success.

370
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,140
 Also you're now addicted to heroin."

371
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,780
 He's like, "Ugh."

372
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,180
 But I guess heroin would be the least of your problems.

373
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
 You hope you don't get hepatitis C or something like that.

374
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:16,120
 But he has these rows of beds and these people are hooked up to this thing and he's basically

375
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,920
 harvesting them for their blood.

376
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,520
 One day this skinny dude is running through India.

377
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,680
 He's like, "Ugh, ugh, so hot."

378
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,880
 It was hot in the shed, but it's even hotter out here somehow.

379
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,200
 And he's like running and he gets into the center of town and he's like, "Guys, guys,

380
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
 guys, you gotta help me, dude.

381
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,640
 I just had the most horrible experience, dude.

382
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,680
 I was trapped and this guy is draining my blood.

383
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,300
 He's not Count Dracula.

384
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,820
 He's not Count Dracula, but I was trapped and this guy was draining my blood and I left

385
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
 a bunch of people back there.

386
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
 You gotta help me."

387
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,780
 And everyone was like, "Dude, first off, you look like a drug addict.

388
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,180
 Secondly, I'm pretty sure I've seen you around town as a drug addict.

389
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,780
 Third, you got a bunch of holes in your arm.

390
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,060
 C points one and two.

391
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
 We think you're a drug addict.

392
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,460
 We're not gonna help you."

393
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,900
 He's like, "Can you at least give me a taxi ride to the police station?"

394
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,380
 They're like, "No, it's three miles that way."

395
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,360
 So then he's running, he's running, he goes to the police station.

396
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 They're like, "What's up?"

397
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,560
 And he's like, "Do I have to tell this story again?"

398
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,760
 And he tells him the story again.

399
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,800
 He goes, "I just escaped from a guy in Count Dracula draining people of blood.

400
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,600
 So the cops go out there and they kick him the door and they see what I've described

401
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 to you.

402
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,680
 They basically see a bunch of emaciated people laying in beds hooked up to bags of blood.

403
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,920
 The bags are just sitting on the ground."

404
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,980
 He had 17 people in his compound when the cops kicked down the door.

405
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:46,860
 The one guy who escaped had been there for three years chained to that bed, having blood

406
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
 drained out of him.

407
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
 Now it wasn't like constant.

408
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,740
 It was, I mean, because you only have what, 10 pints of blood in you, but he would drain

409
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,740
 the blood out of you, feed you a bit, give you a bit of water, let you get back to health.

410
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,700
 There's a little asterisk there.

411
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,760
 Leave for you to get to the point where he could take more blood out of you.

412
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,600
 But he definitely wasn't waiting 48 days.

413
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 He was milking them like they were cattle.

414
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,040
 As the police were interviewing these survivors, they were actively looking for the laboratory

415
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
 specialist and Papu.

416
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,760
 They go, "Well, did anyone die?

417
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,000
 Did anyone die during this whole thing?"

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,120
 And the answer is no, again, with the little asterisks, because they said that when someone

419
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,500
 was on the edge of death, Papu would try to get every last drop out of these guys.

420
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,860
 When they were on the edge of death, he would unhook them, walk them outside, give them

421
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,260
 a little sip of water, and then push them onto a bus.

422
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,260
 Pay the bus driver and says, "Take this guy home.

423
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
 You have a new pet.

424
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,660
 It's like a Pokemon, but he's about to die."

425
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,860
 And he would just have him dropped off somewhere in India.

426
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,440
 It's not my problem, see.

427
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,540
 He would drain them of as much blood as he possibly could.

428
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,920
 And then if they were going to die, he would ship them off, and nobody knows what happened

429
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,400
 to these people, because they were already transient drug addicted people.

430
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,020
 So the police were never able to track down if anyone died because of this.

431
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,860
 These people had no names.

432
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,880
 They simply were dropped off.

433
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,420
 When these people were rescued, they were immediately taken to the hospital, where they

434
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,780
 were given surprise, surprise blood transfusions.

435
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
 I thought it was interesting.

436
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:30,000
 Gary Foster noted in his email to me, he goes, "I wonder how many of those patients actually

437
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,520
 got the same blood that they had donated?"

438
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,360
 Because so much of it in that area was coming from this farm.

439
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,480
 He goes, "I wonder if they got their same donated.

440
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
 What if they mixed them up?"

441
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,320
 The guy's like, "Hey, I got a little bit of you and me."

442
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
 And the guy's like, "I got a little bit of you.

443
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
 They're giving each other high five."

444
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,680
 And then their hands break apart.

445
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,960
 That was actually another thing the doctor said.

446
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,280
 These guys were so dehydrated.

447
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,580
 He goes, "First off, they were just gray."

448
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,460
 These people were totally gray looking.

449
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,540
 He goes, "You could grab their skin and pinch it, and then it would stay there like molded

450
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
 clay."

451
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,500
 Now, I'm sure eventually it went away, but it would be kind of funny.

452
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,700
 You just walk up, keep pinching them.

453
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,100
 He's like, "Stop it, stop it.

454
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,660
 You're giving him like a funny looking face."

455
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,340
 He already has a funny looking face.

456
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,580
 He's on the edge of death, but you know, you could give him like big old jowls.

457
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,300
 He looks like a Dick Tracy villain.

458
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,860
 Anyways, out of these 17 people, they all survived.

459
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,040
 And Papu gets arrested.

460
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,680
 He does nine months in prison for this.

461
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:30,200
 He kept these guys, he kept at least the one guy in captivity for three years.

462
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
 He does nine months in prison and gets away with it.

463
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
 Because when you have a country that may have been exporting human skeletons from a human

464
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,760
 skeleton farm, wouldn't you turn a blind eye to something like this?

465
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,960
 This is one of those stories that you catch the one guy who doesn't, but you know that

466
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,940
 the fact that this even happened gave the idea to hundreds of other people.

467
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,900
 People who never thought about going into the blood bank business would have read articles

468
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,340
 about this and go, "Whoa, he was paying someone $3.

469
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,740
 He was making $20 a bag from this."

470
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:15,420
 $17 in a country where $1,600 is the average income and he only did nine months in prison?

471
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:22,640
 You know people did the risk analysis on this and decided I could keep an operation in business

472
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,840
 for three years and do nine months in prison?

473
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,800
 If I get caught, the reason why he got caught was because the guy ran away.

474
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,560
 And the reason why the guy ran away was because Papu accidentally left a door unlocked one

475
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
 day.

476
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:45,240
 A simple mistake uncovered a blood farm where humans were the livestock.

477
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,300
 How many of these farms exist out there today?

478
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,740
 Undiscovered.

479
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:57,980
 How many men, women, and children are being slowly drained of their precious bodily fluids

480
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,180
 to be sold to hospitals to save the lives of others?

481
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,380
 And even though they say it's very hard to get hold of a human skeleton today, it's

482
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,940
 not impossible.

483
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:18,200
 You pay the right price. Because what do you do with human livestock when you can no longer

484
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,720
 get blood out of it?

485
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
 You could put them on a bus and it would be somebody else's problem.

486
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,680
 Or you could move them out of the tin shed into the slaughterhouse.

487
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:39,880
 A human life once full of so much promise became a piece of meat and now sits as a skeleton,

488
00:26:39,880 --> 00:27:07,060
 a tool for learning, staring at the classroom through hollow, lifeless sockets.
