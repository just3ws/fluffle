1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 A horrible conspiracy involving man's best friend?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,380
 And then we take a look at a conspiracy that involves the highest levels of government.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,500
 Was there a plan to project a holographic Jesus in the sky?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,360
 We'll find out when we look at Project Bluebeam today on Dead Rava Radio.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,120
 [Music]

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,640
 I hope you guys had a great weekend and we're going up to Thanksgiving here.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,640
 I'm gonna try to find some Thanksgiving related conspiracies.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,120
 I think Thanksgiving is the middle child of the winter holidays.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,080
 Cause everyone's like getting ready for October at Halloween and then we go on a Christmas

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 right away.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,520
 There's no Thanksgiving music.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,680
 Like eat that turkey.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,200
 Don't get gravy on your shirt.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,520
 There's nothing like that.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,680
 There's some Thanksgiving movies, but a lot of times they're just kind of like holiday

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
 movies.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,000
 I think most movies you have like Halloween Town and The Witches and Every Horror Movie.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,920
 And then for Christmas you have like Christmas vacation and It's Wonderful Life and all that

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
 stuff.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,000
 But there's not any like big Thanksgiving movies.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,440
 Die Hard doesn't take place during Thanksgiving.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,600
 So I'm gonna see if there's some Thanksgiving.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,940
 There's a ton of Thanksgiving true crimes unfortunately cause you get a bunch of people

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,080
 together who don't necessarily like each other, i.e. family.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,160
 I'm gonna see if I can find some Thanksgiving based conspiracies.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,840
 Or even I'll even go for Thanksgiving ghosts.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
 Ghosts that only come out on Thanksgiving.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,080
 But I'm gonna see what I can find.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,160
 And you're like Jason, that's what the weekend's for.

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,520
 That's when you're not recording your podcast.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's to do your research.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,440
 But I'm gonna still see if I can find some Thanksgiving related conspiracies for you.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,760
 Now that I'm thinking about Thanksgiving, get some mashed potatoes.

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,220
 I'm not gonna do the keto this week cause I'm gonna get me some Thanksgiving.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,100
 And you're like Jason, you have a...

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,820
 Why go off your diet for a week if there's only gonna be eating for one day?

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,420
 Well that's so I'm not so sick that one day.

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,980
 So I'm not like, "Ahh, I ate a bunch of potatoes and stuff on one day."

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
 I don't know.

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,320
 I'm gonna get excuses cause I wanted to eat a candy bar.

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 Okay.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 Okay.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
 But anyways, yeah, I'm taking a break.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
 So I'm gonna get some stuffing and some potatoes.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 Some green beans.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,640
 And some turkey.

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,200
 So the first story we're gonna cover here, it's a sad one guys.

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:46,760
 If you like puppies and you like cats, then just skip ahead until you hear me talk about

53
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,660
 beams in the sky.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,460
 But if you don't like puppies, if you don't like puppies or cats, I love puppies and cats.

55
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,060
 And this is actually, I read the story and I honestly thought it was fake.

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,700
 I thought it was a moral panic.

57
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
 I was like, "There's no way this is going on.

58
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,740
 If it is going on, it's on a very, very limited scale."

59
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,060
 When I first saw the headlines I'm linking around, I'm like, "I don't believe this.

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,820
 I don't believe this is actually happening."

61
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
 But it is.

62
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,140
 So what happened was, let's make it a personal story real quick.

63
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:21,000
 So there was a woman, there is a woman named Heather, can't pronounce her last name, Piri,

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,320
 Piri Rare, Piri Era.

65
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
 It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
 There's this girl named Heather.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
 She lives in Kentucky.

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,240
 She brought her puppy into the vet and she's like, "I don't know what happened to my dog."

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,280
 He has these cuts on him and the vet's like, "Oh my God."

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
 He must have really got scraped by something.

71
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,560
 She's like, "Yeah, he's been in a lot of pain.

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,400
 Do you have any tramadol?"

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
 That has helped him in the past.

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 And the vet's like, "Yeah, sure.

75
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,960
 I'm giving him some tramadol and bandage him up."

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 Okay.

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,020
 And a while later, she comes back with her dog after a period of time and says, "My

78
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,640
 dog, look at these cuts.

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
 Got cut again."

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,780
 The vet's like, "Oh my, you're right.

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
 Look at these.

82
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,060
 These cuts look incredibly straight.

83
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,460
 They don't look like they would have come from an animal."

84
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,580
 "Yeah, my dog got cut.

85
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,580
 That's the bottom line.

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,100
 Do you have any tramadol for my dog?"

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
 "Uh, yeah, sure.

88
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,500
 In fact, it gives the dog some tramadol."

89
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,160
 Once happened three times and eventually the vet was like, "Okay, something's up.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
 These cuts look like they were made deliberately.

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
 They don't look like it was a raccoon.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,280
 It was like, shh, came at him.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,360
 It doesn't look like he was walking on some rusty stuff.

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
 They looked very straight.

95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
 Called the cops.

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
 Cops investigate her.

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,680
 They grab Heather.

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,880
 And she admits that she was cutting the dog with a razor blade, giving him cuts on his

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,480
 tummy or cuts on his back wherever.

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,820
 And then taking him to the vet and saying, "My dog's been injured.

101
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,820
 I need tramadol."

102
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
 Now, you read that and you're like, you hear that and you're like, "That's just..."

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,740
 Oh, the woman went to jail.

104
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,300
 And she denoted another clinic, too.

105
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,700
 You're like, "Okay, Jason, that's a one-off story.

106
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,580
 I can see an addict doing that."

107
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,020
 Not an addict, an addict doing that.

108
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,380
 And that's kind of where I was at in this story.

109
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,940
 I was like, "I'm sure there's one example of somebody doing this."

110
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,900
 CDC actually this year released a letter.

111
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,420
 So the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said, "We've been doing this for a long time.

112
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,040
 We believe this is an ongoing issue.

113
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,280
 We believe that people are purposely injuring their pets for opioids."

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,520
 Not only that, people think that they're taking other people's pets, injuring them and taking

115
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 them to the vet.

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,760
 So for the addict who doesn't have a pet, they will steal your pet and be like, "Oh,

117
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
 this dog, look at...

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
 He has a broken leg."

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,040
 And the guy will be like, "Oh, my God.

120
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 What's his name?"

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 And they're like, "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

123
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

126
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

127
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

128
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 uh, uh, uh

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

131
00:06:39,360 --> 00:07:09,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

132
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:39,360
 I want the, the pink pills, not the, the yellow circles, and the, I'm maybe not that obvious about it, but, so we've seen people do that in, for their medical conditions, animals are basically trained to love you and trust you. And if you're injuring them to get your drugs, there's something extra despicable about that. And the worst part is some people just go in and say, my dog can't eat, my dog can't do that, and they'll lie. But if you're actually injuring the animals, and then you're taking them to the hospital, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they're like, I'm gonna go and get them, and they

133
00:07:39,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:09:09,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

136
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:39,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

138
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

139
00:10:39,360 --> 00:11:05,360
 Okay, so the next conspiracy we're gonna talk about was something that I've been aware

140
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,360
 for a long, long time. I was a kid. This really, this conspiracy really started in like 1994,

141
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,360
 1996. I just graduated high school. Back then, everything was pretty much in book form. There

142
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 weren't a lot of websites on conspiracies, or they were, but you couldn't find them unless

143
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,360
 you had the web address. You didn't really know what to look for. And I remember hearing

144
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,360
 about this conspiracy theory and it really scared me. Like, it was one of the ones that

145
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,360
 I thought was absolutely possible. I remember just being like, "Oh man, like, if this happens,

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 this will fool millions of people and all of these things will come true." And so on,

147
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,360
 I was a kid. Uh, yeah, it was quite terrifying to me. And I don't know why, like, looking back on it,

148
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,360
 it's completely ridiculous. But I also believed at the time that when Clinton was, Clinton was

149
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,360
 gonna install death camps and when he lost the election, you know, he didn't lose the election,

150
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 but when he stops being president, he's not gonna leave office. He's gonna take over the

151
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 country and he's going to throw everyone into a death camp. All that nonsense. That whole

152
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,360
 agenda 21, that's been around for the past three presidents. Bush isn't gonna leave office.

153
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 He's gonna set up. Obama's not gonna leave office. He's gonna set up. But anyways, I had been

154
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 researching conspiracy theories and paranormal and stuff like that since I was 12. And I remember

155
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,360
 coming across this and I was like, "This is plausible. This is a plausible conspiracy theory."

156
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 Now, what's interesting was, I don't think it's plausible so much anymore, but not because of

157
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
 what it includes. This was always an interesting puzzle for me, just like Comet Elenin. I did that

158
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,360
 episode about Comet Elenin. I have my own theory about Bluebeam, but let's talk about Project

159
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 Bluebeam first and then I'll get into my theory. So Project Bluebeam, there was a book published in

160
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:59,360
 1994 called Project Bluebeam by a Cubeky. He's from Cubek, Cubekois, Cubekian. His name was

161
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,360
 Serge Monist, which is a pretty dope name. I'm sure people are like, "No, it's Sergei Monista."

162
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 But anyways, we're gonna call him Serge. So Serge Monist wrote this book called Project Bluebeam

163
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,360
 in 1994. Now, he had a bit of a conspiracy involving himself as well. He was homeschooling his

164
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 children and the police took him away. They're like, "You can't homeschool your kids." And he was like,

165
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 "No, you gotta let me homeschool my kids." And he said the police were after him and they were

166
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 because they were after him to get his kids and they removed the kids from the house. He got arrested

167
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,360
 and then the next day he died of a heart attack. And conspiracy theorists have said all of that

168
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,360
 had to come down to him exposing the truth to Project Bluebeam. Now, we'll get back to his death

169
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,360
 in a second. But let's go ahead and move on to what actually Project Bluebeam is. Now, Project

170
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,360
 Bluebeam, Project Bluebeam had four steps. Step one, there was gonna be staged earthquakes all

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 over the world. Look out, a run. People are throwing their pets under the rubble and taking them

172
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 to the vet. "Oh, no, look at... please give me some pills." So, Serge monst... monast, Serge said that

173
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,360
 I'm pretty sure it's Serge, Serge, but whatever. Serge was like, "There's going to be these staged

174
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,360
 earthquakes all over the world. And what's gonna happen is it's going to reveal these documents,

175
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,360
 the stone tablets, these texts, showing other religions are wrong. So you would find relics

176
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,360
 that disprove... Muhammad was the prophet. You would find relics that would disprove Buddhism

177
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,360
 and disprove Christianity and all this stuff. So that'd be the first step. So first people would be like,

178
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,360
 "That's weird. We found these stone tablets that show Jesus like kicking a kid down the street.

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 Maybe we should double think our whole Christianity thing." So you're like, "Okay, that's a

180
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,360
 plausible... that's like chapter one of a disaster novel, kind of like an intriguing thriller.

181
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 There's earthquakes are staged by the government and people are finding these texts that disprove

182
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
 what we think of as history." You're like, "Okay, that's fairly plausible, Jason."

183
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 Step two, space holograms. So step two was this. Each region in the world, based on whatever

184
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,360
 national faith was the most popular, you would see like over America and Europe, you would see

185
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,360
 Jesus appear in the sky. You'd just be... which would be terrifying. And I think that was one of

186
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,360
 the reasons why this one terrified me. It gets creepier, but imagine you're just walking down

187
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 the street one day and you see everyone looking up in the sky and you look up and you just see

188
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 a giant Jesus floating in the sky, like a 30 foot tall Jesus. And then in the Middle East

189
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 they look up and they'll see Allah or Muhammad, but here's the problem. They don't really know

190
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 what he looks like because they don't have any pictures of him. Not like there's pictures of Jesus,

191
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 but at least there's representations of what we think, of what we... that's not what he looks

192
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,360
 like at all. He was Jewish and he was short, but you have like, "Oh, if even an atheist looked

193
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,360
 up in the sky, he'd be like, "Oh, that looks like how Jesus is portrayed in the media."

194
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
 So I don't know what you would see in the Middle East. And then Judaism would just have like

195
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,360
 some old dude, some old God, Moses looking dude, and then Buddhism would have Buddha floating

196
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360
 around. I guess in like atheist countries, you would just be a blank sky. You just look up

197
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
 and go like, "Sunny day out?" Yeah, look at that. Nothing. I heard in America Jesus floating

198
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 around, but up here is just the sun. So anyways, religious icons from all over the world appear.

199
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 And that dude, could you imagine being an India then? It would just be like this fiery, like

200
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
 eight armed elephant riding four donkeys. I'd be like, "Oh man, why can't I just get the Jesus

201
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,360
 hologram?" Anyways, so all these holograms appear and then they all shape shift to form the

202
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:58,360
 same vision of this new God. And then it's like, "I am the one true God. Worship me." Like, all the,

203
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 I've shown you that the texts from the old world were wrong. I caused the earthquakes. I am the

204
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 true God. It puts something in your head that if you don't follow the instructions of this

205
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 new God, it actually will start to drive you insane. And you may kill yourself. So you almost

206
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,360
 feel drawn to do whatever this hologram says. So apparently the way that this works is the

207
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,360
 holograms are based. There's a satellite that can shoot holograms. It projects them on the sodium

208
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,360
 layer, which is apparently 60 miles up. And circling the entire planet, there's something called

209
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 the sodium layer that can work as a film screen. And that's what UFOs are. They're just all

210
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 holograms. It's the system being tested. They've apparently had this technology since, you know,

211
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 the 1940s. And it's all just a test to see if they can actually get people to look up at the sky

212
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 and see something ridiculous and believe in it. And this satellite can also abduct people. And the

213
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 reason why it's set up to do that is it's to simulate the rapture, which is in Christian lore,

214
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 in some Christian lore. There's a lot of debate over whether or not it's even in the Bible, but

215
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,360
 that all the believers will be raptured up and taken off the planet. And everyone else is left to

216
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,360
 suffer while the Antichrist is doing his crazy thing on Earth. So it would just suck up a bunch of

217
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 people. And you'd be like, I told you the rapture was true. Flying up. And then they like slowly

218
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 freeze to death. That's kind of vague. They don't say where those people go if the body of space

219
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 is just littered with a bunch of bodies. Because they're obviously not getting raptured. They're just

220
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,360
 being sucked up into the sky. The UN decides to use the song "Ode to Joy" as a

221
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:45,360
 song to unite the people. You know, that song. And so that is going to be that song. And it's almost

222
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,360
 like so that you have those factions, you have the people who believe 100% and then you have the

223
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 people that are going crazy and just massive unrest. And the UN starts to create this new world

224
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,360
 order and they use "Ode to Joy" as their theme song. That's all stage two. And you're like,

225
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,360
 "Man, there's two more stages?" Yes, two more stages. Stage three. Telepathy. So all the knowledge

226
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,360
 we have of Bluebeam. Because the book is out of print. There's a few mentions. Now there's

227
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,360
 more information, but at the time of Serge's death, there's a few mentions on the internet,

228
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,360
 a transcript of a lecture. And that's it. So some of the information is spotting on what his

229
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:33,360
 theories actually were. But so step three is labeled telepathy. And it says that it talks about

230
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 this thing called the telepathic electronic two-way communication. And it's basically a direct

231
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 or indirect communication into your head from this satellite. So it's beam and stuff in your head

232
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,360
 and you can either contact it, you can either read your mind and you can talk to it, or it's just

233
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 images being broadcast into your head. And that's weird. That's its own step, because that's kind of implied

234
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 in step two. Step four is the end game. So we've all seen this. There's massive riots. People are

235
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 really just like, "I guess my religion is fake. And I must serve this new god or this religion's fake

236
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 and I'm fighting it. Oh, my head. Oh, and then they start rioting." Step four is the end game of

237
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 Bluebeam. And there's three different scenarios. So one of these three will happen once Project

238
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:29,360
 Bluebeam's gotten to stage four. One, people aren't down with the whole Jesus religious thing. People

239
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 see it and they're just like, "That's not my god." Even the people who like, it doesn't basically work

240
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,360
 for them or the telepathy thing isn't working or whatever. So it's kind of weird because these are

241
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 almost like, these are the final step, but it's almost like their contingency plan. So let's say the

242
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 Jesus thing doesn't work. Everyone's like, they see a plane fly through Jesus. They're like, "That's not Jesus."

243
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,360
 They then use Bluebeam to show an alien invasion, a full-on alien invasion being projected into our skies.

244
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,360
 Countries fire nukes at them, which is what they would do. The nukes obviously fail because they're

245
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 holograms. And then it's revealed it was all a trick. It was all a trick. But the fact that governments

246
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:19,360
 could be confused by these holographic UFOs and previous holographic Jesus shows that they can't have

247
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 nuclear weapons so the nuclear weapons are taken away. So that's one scenario that happens. Scenario two

248
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 is that all the Christians get raptured by aliens because there's an evil demonic force coming.

249
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 And again, you're like, "Jesus, that doesn't make sense because Jesus was just floating around."

250
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 Because we don't have a ton of information on Project Bluebeam. But again, contingency plans.

251
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 These may be the setup for if they decide to not go with the Jesus thing, actually.

252
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:52,360
 We kind of have to guess at this point. But it's that Christians get raptured and everyone else is like,

253
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 "Why are we left?" And they're like, "Oh, you'll find out. There's a bunch of demons gone in space."

254
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 And then the third one is that there is using fiber optic cables. And again, you're like,

255
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 "Okay, that's all like, again, science-based." You know, radio waves into your head to simulate telepathy.

256
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 The last contingency plan for Project Bluebeam is that using fiber optic cables, coax cables,

257
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 telephone cables, electrical cables, demons will jump through your electronics and beat you up.

258
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,360
 Satanic ghosts projected all over the world will show up and be like, "Brawr!"

259
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 Basically like ghostbusters. And it would just be like this mass attack from all the supernatural forces

260
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
 and it would make people go, "Please, government, save us from all these demons."

261
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 That's completely ridiculous. And that's weird to say, out of all the stuff that I've just read,

262
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 that has to be one of the dumbest possible scenarios.

263
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 Demons are jumping out of your coax cable and scaring you so much you ask the government to help you.

264
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,360
 That's, I think at that point, Serge was just like, "Ah, whatever, tune, I'm just done."

265
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 He said that at the end of the lecture because he needed to go get a drink of soda.

266
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 He's like, "So is that all?" And he's like, "Yeah, ghosts come out of your phone. I'll be back.

267
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 I'll see you later." The point of Project Blooping is to instill, so we have all those scenarios,

268
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,360
 those four stages, and the three contingency plans.

269
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 The point of Project Blooping, you're thinking, "What's the point?" It's to create a police state.

270
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 It's to create a state of world where people are so fearful, so unsure, so terrified,

271
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 so demonically possessed, so I can't go near my toaster because, about Balbarath may jump out of it.

272
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,360
 You've got hologram Jesus in your sky, your neighbors got raptured, and then you saw their bodies fall when the beam shut off.

273
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 You've got this guy who you think is demonically possessed, and you've got ghosts coming out of your fridge every time you open it,

274
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 so you're like, "Please, government, please form a police state."

275
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 What I just told you is pretty much everything we know about Project Blooping,

276
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,360
 because, again, there's not a lot of information on it, but there's just enough to get the creative juices flowing.

277
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 Now, the thing is, I've talked about this in other episodes.

278
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,360
 Conspiracy theories that nobody knows about, they tend to be true.

279
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 Now, I know that sounds weird, but I've come across conspiracy theories that there is a very, very limited amount of information on,

280
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,360
 and they're kind of tucked away in corners of the internet, and you read it, and you're like, "Oh, my God."

281
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
 And then you try to do research on it, and there's nothing.

282
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 And again, it means a few things. One, it can mean that it's totally fake.

283
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 It's like, absolutely made up, and it never caught on.

284
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 Two, it means that it's still fake, but one could be that they're just lying and making it up, full stop.

285
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 The second one is that it's fake, but it hasn't gotten popular yet.

286
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,360
 And the third one is it's real, and it's being actively suppressed, and that's why the information's not getting out there.

287
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,360
 If 9/11 was really an inside job, nobody would know about it.

288
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,360
 Golf of Tonkin, those conspirator people who weren't like, "Oh, dude, did you hear about Vietnam? Yeah, they blew up their own boat,

289
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
 and they faked this attack and stuff like that."

290
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,360
 All of that information came out decades later.

291
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 There may have been an intrepid journalist back then reporting on it that story never got published, because it was an active conspiracy.

292
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,360
 It wasn't until much later that people were able to actually sit down and confirm that the Golf of Tonkin didn't happen.

293
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 So I was like, I heard about it, I couldn't confirm anything of it, I didn't know why at the time, because again, we didn't have a lot of information on it.

294
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,360
 I would stumble across it, and I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, I remember that one, that one totally scared me."

295
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:44,360
 I still couldn't find any additional information. It was very, very well known.

296
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 And then what happened was there was a change where it became super popular.

297
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,360
 In probably the past 10 years, it's become very common knowledge, Project Bluebeam is this, it's really blown up.

298
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 This is my theory. My theory is that it was a real plan, not the ghost stuff, get rid of the ghost stuff.

299
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:13,360
 I think that the government did have the technology to do this stuff, and Serge got this information out, and he was taken out of the game,

300
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,360
 and they were actively suppressing the conspiracy theory for 20 years, and then eventually someone said, "We're not going to do that."

301
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,360
 The plan's not going to work now, it would have worked back then, but nowadays with CGI being so popular, it's just not going to work.

302
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 So then they stopped suppressing it, and that's why it's so popular nowadays. That's my theory.

303
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 That it was actually a plan on the table to use in some fashion, and the information got out, and they were actively pushing it off the grid.

304
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 And then they just decided not to do it, because now you can find the information anywhere.

305
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,360
 So you type in Project Bluebeam, now you'll find more resources, a ton of YouTube videos and stuff like that.

306
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 But as a skeptic, we do have to look at a couple different things here real quick. I know the episodes are running long, but the whole story about Serge and his kids,

307
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:09,360
 I was like, "Oh, that's crazy, like what terrible." I wasn't able to find any confirmation that he had kids, I couldn't find any article with the names of his kids, his kids disappeared after it.

308
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,360
 What happened to him afterwards? They never came forward and say, "I believe that my father was killed by the government at it." They just kind of disappeared.

309
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,360
 So that story may not be true. We do know that he died, and he got arrested apparently, but I don't know the details.

310
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
 But again, if you're actively suppressing it, those kids could just have gone into the foster system and then us never know about him.

311
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,360
 But I didn't think that was weird, that story just kind of ended.

312
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:46,360
 Now, the biggest pushback to Project Bluebeam is that there was actually a link to an unproduced Star Trek script where there was a guy basically using technology to control a planet.

313
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,360
 Eventually, it was written for Star Trek. It was called Star Trek Next Voyage, or Star Trek Next Journey.

314
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,360
 They were going to do a sequel to the original television show, and they decided to do the movie instead.

315
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:06,360
 The script that was unproduced went on to be made in 1991, called "Devil's Do" for Star Trek The Next Generation.

316
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,360
 And The Devil's Do is... It's actually a pretty good episode. I liked it.

317
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 This alien, this woman, shows up to this planet and she projects herself as a hologram in the sky. She causes earthquakes.

318
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 She takes on the form of the Christian Devil and the Klingon Devil, and she captures the Enterprise, and she's like, "You belong to me. Everyone on this planet belongs to me."

319
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,360
 They made a deal with me a thousand years ago that I would stop their famine.

320
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:39,360
 And then they find out that there's just like a cloaked ship off orbit, and she has this technology that's more powerful than even the Enterprise.

321
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,360
 They weren't able to tell that it was just holograms. They thought it could be something else.

322
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:52,360
 So it could be that he saw the original unproduced script for that Star Trek episode, or he'd heard rumors about it and came up with this idea.

323
00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 It could even be that he had a basic idea of what he thought Project Bluebeam was, and the Star Trek episode came out and they melded it together.

324
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 It could be that he saw the... It's totally made up. It could be that he saw the Star Trek episode and thought that was predictive programming,

325
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 that the media will always tell you what happens before it happens, which is not true.

326
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,360
 It could have been, you know, "Oh, they always got to tell us what they do before they do it. That's why they put it in this obscure episode of Star Trek."

327
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,360
 We don't know. He could have just been a guy who was writing fanciful stuff, and he died of a heart attack, and it was something that is just kind of grown with time.

328
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 It could have been... He could have been someone who discovered actual proof that the governments of the world were going to use this program, and they took him out.

329
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:51,360
 It could also be a little bit of both. It could be that he had an inkling of the truth. He knew enough to be dangerous, but the stuff he didn't know, he filled in the blanks, and that's what made it ridiculous.

330
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:04,360
 He could have had knowledge of certain parts of the plan and certain pieces of the technology, and it was just enough for the government to go, "He's too close. This is too close to what we're trying to do."

331
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,360
 We may never do it. It's a backup plan. We may never need it, but we can't let this get out.

332
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 Yeah, the ghost jumping out of all this stuff. And I know I keep going back to that, but it's just so ridiculous.

333
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 You know, he added in all this demonic stuff. We're not going to do that, but we do have this satellite that can project these images. He knows too much.

334
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:32,360
 So we're going to suppress this story, and, you know, after a period of time, they're like, "Forget it. They may... They've stopped paying their suppression bills."

335
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 And so the story, and they're like, "I thought we were suppressing that. Yeah, we're not going to do that, Barry. Oh yeah, I guess you're right. We're not going to do that."

336
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,360
 Did he get assassinated? You know, that's the question. He was 51 years old. He was very, very overweight. He had a heart attack.

337
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,360
 That's not, you know, that's not a statistical anomaly. That's definitely possible. That's in the realm of possibility.

338
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,360
 Did his kids get taken away? Again, that's the story, but I wasn't able to find any proof of that.

339
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:03,360
 If I have anyone from Quebec listening, I actually do have some Quebec listeners, but probably not anymore, because I'm sure I'm mispronouncing the name of your province.

340
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:11,360
 But if you can dig up some police files, I'm like, "Yes, go find police files on this guy. You may have been assassinated by the government and get back to me."

341
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:20,360
 So that's the story of Project Bluebeam and its author, Serge Monast. Did he have kids? Was he killed? Is that part of the story true?

342
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:28,360
 Did he stumble across some hidden technology that was going to be used on a later date? I don't know. I have my theory.

343
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:36,360
 But I think the story behind Bluebeam is just as interesting as the story of Bluebeam itself.
