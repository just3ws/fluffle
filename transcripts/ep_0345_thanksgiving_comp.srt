1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
 A follow-up story to a hobo with a bucket of hot diarrhea.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,380
 What happens when his attacks go viral?

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:20,660
 And then we travel around the world to follow a myth that has plagued humanity for hundreds of years.

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,120
 No matter what culture you belong to, no matter what language you speak,

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,320
 all parents warn their children about the man with the bag today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:41,000
 [music]

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,720
 It is Thanksgiving and I don't know why I always make this mistake,

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,320
 but I gotta remember I record the episodes the day before.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,960
 So yesterday's episode should have been the Thanksgiving episode.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,880
 Yesterday's episode should have been full of Thanksgiving goodness.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,920
 Instead, I talked about people eating people's fat out of their body,

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,560
 which has been a common theme this week and it's actually not the end of it.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,640
 We're going to do one more story, actually the origin story.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,160
 The reason why I started looking at fat eating monsters to begin with.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
 It all gets wrapped up today.

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,520
 Hopefully, hopefully there's no more gooey gooey goodness in our future.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
 Easily the most disgusting.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,240
 We've had Cryptid Week, we've had Bigfoot Week,

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,160
 and now we have Fat Eating Week, which I never ever thought would actually be a theme.

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,280
 But let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,600
 Now, one of my favorite stories I've covered recently is the hobo with the hot diarrhea.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,320
 I know that a lot of people probably thought that was a little disgusting,

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,520
 but the idea that the news reports kept saying the temperature of it,

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,000
 it just made it so much more visceral and made it so much more of a compelling story.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,600
 And it was one of those things that when I got done doing it,

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
 I thought, "Well, that'll never happen again.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 I should suck all the enjoyment out of that story as possible,

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 because that'll never happen again, right?"

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 Let's hop in the Carbenter Coptor and head up to Toronto, Canada.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 It's November 22nd, 2019, 5.20pm.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 Walking through the streets of Toronto, we see a library.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 Now, I'm not a nerd. I'm going to assume you're a nerd, but I'm not.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 I don't do none of that book reading.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,800
 We walk into John P. Robarts, not Roberts, totally different spelling.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 John P. Robarts Library.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
 I hope some of you guys live in Toronto, so you can go on a sightseeing tour of all of this stuff.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 We walk into John P. Robarts Library, University of Toronto.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
 And there's two people, dudes, women.

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 It doesn't really say the gender of these people, so we're just going to assume it's mixed.

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 It's a man and a woman, just to make it extra, extra shocking, I guess.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 Because here's the thing, like, well, okay, I'm not going to spoil the surprise.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 I don't know where this is going, but we'll get to the man versus woman part of this story in a second.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 We're standing. We're like peeking behind a bookshelf.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 We're not going to be in the middle of the story. We're peeking behind a bookshelf.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 And we see a man walking through the library carrying a bucket.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 Now, in this story, with the hobo story, I go, "I wonder how big the bucket was?"

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,800
 In this one, we know how big the bucket is. It is a straight-up, like, 10-gallon paint bucket.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 Like, something you would buy from Home Depot, which was a joke that I told the first time.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 This time, we have surveillance photos. So these two people are sitting there doing homework in the library.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
 Guy walks by with a bucket, carrying a bucket through the library.

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 And then...

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
 [slurps]

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 Warm liquid just splatters all over their body.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 Dude runs away.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 Now, it doesn't take long for the two people to realize they are covered in diarrhea.

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 But he walked up with a bucket at 5.20 p.m. and threw hot...

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 Not hot. Technically, this stuff is always considered warm.

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
 So I can't use the term "hot diarrhea."

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 But this was warm diarrhea just going all over these two people.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 Obviously, get the authorities involved. The Mounties show up.

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 They're riding their horses through the library, kicking over people.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 Not going to rebook shelves. Get out of the way.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
 Poop alert.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,800
 And they actually took samples because the question was, "Is this human feces?"

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 Could you imagine being the rookie on that case?

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 They're like, "Hey, go pick that up."

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
 And you're like, "I'm pretty sure dogs don't eat corn.

71
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
 There's corn everywhere."

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 And they're like, "Nah, we still have to take it back to the lab."

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 They're all laughing at them. The veterans are all laughing at that rookie cop.

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 They're pooping more. They're pooping more in the corner.

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 But hey, Johnny, I found some over here. Get another sample.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 November 24th.

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 Two days later. November 24th.

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
 It's 5 p.m.

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 I tell you, "Hey guys, I'll meet you at a library."

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 I'll catch up with you. Why don't you go into the library and do some reading?

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 Go to Scott Library at York University.

82
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 Go, go, go. I'll catch up with you.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
 And you're like, "Okay, I trust you, Jason. You seem like an affable fellow."

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 You would never trick me.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 So you go into Scott Library, York University.

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 I'm like, "Make sure you're there at 5 p.m."

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
 You're like, "Okay, thanks. Thanks, my best friend."

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 And so you're reading a book about friendship.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 You're reading a book about trust. Trusting people.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 And while you're doing that, a guy walks up and you're like,

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 "Oh, it must be Jason. I'm going to turn around very slowly with my mouth wide open,

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 about to say hello."

93
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 So as you're turning around going, "Hello."

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 Warm diarrhea. A bucket. A bucket full of warm diarrhea.

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 All over you.

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 And in real life, because this didn't happen to you, I don't think,

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 unless you're listening to the show.

98
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
 In real life, dude was sitting at 5 p.m.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,800
 Scott Library, New York University, covered in liquid diarrhea.

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 Guy runs away.

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 Now at this point, the police are actively looking for him anyways,

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 because of the first attack.

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 But at this point, they're really trying to figure out what is going on.

104
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 Like, this is just beyond disgusting.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 November 25th. One day later.

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
 It's 11.55.

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
 I think this is 11.55 p.m.

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 I didn't write it down.

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
 But we're going to assume it's 11.55 p.m.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
 Simply because I don't...

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 Here's the thing.

112
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
 First attack was November 22nd.

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 Second attack was November 24th.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
 Now it's November 25th.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 So you had two days between the first two attacks,

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 and one day between the second attack and this third attack.

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 How long would it take for you to fill up a bucket full of diarrhea?

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
 The homeless man, and remember, the homeless man in LA,

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 I shouldn't assume that you remembered that story, but...

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 The story in LA was homeless.

121
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 It was a homeless man.

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 It was a single attack with a bucket of hot diarrhea

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 that the firefighters said he must have saved up for a month.

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,800
 This guy has filled up three buckets of diarrhea.

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 Or in the police statement, like in the press release,

126
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 they use the term "liquified fecal matter."

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 Because the word "dairy" is just too funny.

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
 Here's a tip, too.

129
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 I learned this a long time ago.

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 If you ever need to call in sick to work,

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 tell them you have diarrhea,

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 because it's super embarrassing and nobody ever lies about having diarrhea.

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 You can also even say, "I pooped my pants."

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 And then they'll totally believe you,

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 because who would admit to pooping their pants

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
 if they didn't actually poop their pants?

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 That's a tip.

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
 I used to...

139
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 I never call in sick nowadays.

140
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 I used to call in sick all the time.

141
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
 Back when I was young and irresponsible,

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 and now I'm like, "Ugh, companies depend on me."

143
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Plus, I like the paycheck.

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 What was I talking about?

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 Oh, yeah.

146
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 So anyways, it's November 25th.

147
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 And somehow this guy is on his third bucket of poop.

148
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 The libraries, though, are empty.

149
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 Books go unread all over the city.

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 Nobody wants to learn anymore.

151
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 Schools are being shuttered.

152
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 Now, that's not far from the truth.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 People were saying, "Well, you know, I'm going to keep going to the library.

154
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 I'm just going to keep looking over my shoulder.

155
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 I'm really, really scared about what's going on."

156
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 So it's 11.55, and like I said, I believe it's PM.

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
 A young woman is walking down College Street and University Avenue.

158
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,800
 So whoever this guy is, or was, we'll get to that in a minute,

159
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 he definitely doesn't like nerds.

160
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 Every place he has struck has been an educational place or a street.

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 College Street and University Avenue.

162
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 So this guy definitely has something against learning.

163
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 And we actually know who he is.

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 We're working on a suspect now, but we'll get into that.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 Woman's walking down the street.

166
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 Dum de dum de dum.

167
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 Carry in, I don't know what women carry, a purse, obviously.

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 But I've told you about that.

169
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 I believe there's a conspiracy to not put pockets into women's clothing

170
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
 so they buy purses.

171
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 Totally think that's, I think that is a legit conspiracy.

172
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
 Walking down the street with her purse and then like,

173
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 I don't know, holding some books in the other hand.

174
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 And across the street, diarrhea vision.

175
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 [Gasps]

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 Just brown dripping vision, target acquired.

177
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 Dum de dum de dum.

178
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
 He is also from a future where diarrhea has taken over the planet.

179
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 She is going to lead the resistance he needs to stop her now.

180
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,800
 He runs up behind this woman with a bucket of warm fecal,

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 liquefied fecal matter, throws it on her and runs away.

182
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 November 26th.

183
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 One day later, it's 6 p.m.

184
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 Mounty, royal mounted police rides his horse into a press conference.

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 [Laughs]

186
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 Hopps off the horse, walks up to the mic.

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 Yeah, whole city is clapping,

189
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 nerds everywhere are reopening their books,

190
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
 libraries are unlocking their doors.

191
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 They caught this dude.

192
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 Now, I'm pretty sure because it's the next day and it was around 6 p.m.

193
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 I'll bet you anything, they caught him brown handed.

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 I think they probably caught him with handfuls of poop.

195
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 Because it would, I mean, how else are you going to catch this guy?

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 I did have video footage of him,

197
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 but I'm sure they caught him with a bucket of poop walking down the street.

198
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
 I'm sure that's exactly what happened.

199
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 It turns out he was, I don't know if he was a student,

200
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 23 year old Samuel Opukoo.

201
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 And it's the video footage, like you can go, all the show notes are going to be there.

202
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 If you look at the video footage, the surveillance camera footage,

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 he's carrying a bucket, and again, it's like a giant painter's bucket.

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 And there's like a jacket covering it, and he has a huge smile on his face.

205
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 And there's a question about whether or not he is, wait, where was I going with,

206
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,800
 now this funny, because this is a live show and this is normally a part where I'm going to have to cut this part out.

207
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 Because a lot of this show is, the fact that I, however long that was, I think that was 14 minutes, according to the live stream.

208
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 You guys are getting some behind the scenes stuff here.

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 14 minutes without any major cuts or mess ups, that would all stay in the show.

210
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 I'll cut out a little bit in the beginning when I was chatting with you guys.

211
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 And then the thing is, the show is pretty, if you guys are kind of seeing what it's like,

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 it's pretty stream of consciousness.

213
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 Like I'm looking at notes, I have notes taken, and I'm just riffing.

214
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 And you get to a point where I'll start to riff and go,

215
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 "No, that's not where I want to go, or I don't know what that means.

216
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 I'm talking about something that is in a totally different direction, so we cut it out."

217
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 So this is actually funny, because it's not only a live episode, it's kind of like a behind the scenes episode.

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 And now here's a problem I often have, I forgot what I was talking about.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,800
 And because it's the nature of the show, how it is very live, I can't really go back.

220
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 Let me give you guys a little thing too.

221
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 If you'll, yesterday's episode was recorded in two different chunks.

222
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 The whole thing with the fat-socking, the Pish Tacos, I recorded that in the morning,

223
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 along with a very long segment about the meteorite, and a segment about these women who were tricked into doing porn.

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 It's this true crime story going on, this whole litigation thing.

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 And it was really boring.

226
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 I liked the Pish Taco stuff, but the first 20 minutes was really, really boring,

227
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 and I went out, and about eight hours later I came back home, and re-recorded the beginning.

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 And it's interesting, because if you listen to that episode, my energy level is way different from the first half,

229
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 because I was thinking about it all day long.

230
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 I was kind of like, "Okay, why didn't the episode work? It was really boring. Okay, what can I do to correct it?"

231
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,800
 And so I just kind of came in with a different energy, and it's way more punchy and funny.

232
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 And then once I started talking about the Pish Tacos, the tone completely changes,

233
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 because they were recorded eight hours apart.

234
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,800
 So I've done stuff like that, but actually going back now and listening to what I previously said,

235
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
 and trying to complete that thought, I don't do that.

236
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 I just kind of keep going.

237
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 So now I'm going to look at my notes here for a second.

238
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 Oh, so he was really smiling, and I hope that I can edit this in here.

239
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 So when we look at the video footage of him, or the photos that have been taken from the video footage,

240
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 he has this big smile on his face, which makes me think,

241
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 "Here's the thing, like, there could be like, 'Aha, jokes on you!' And he could be like a troll."

242
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,800
 But that's a lot of effort to be a troll, to be pooping in buckets over the course of four days.

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 It's most likely a sexual thing. It was most likely he was getting off on it.

244
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 There's an odd component about it as well, is that why was he choosing the people he was attacking?

245
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 Some people say it could have been a racial thing, because all of his victims were Asian, and he was black.

246
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 But then the Royal County, what are the names of the guys? The Mounties. The Mounties.

247
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said, "We don't think it's a racial thing."

248
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 So I think they're probably thinking more it is a sexual thing, and these people were just targets of opportunity.

249
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 But let's go back to the original question that I kind of brought up earlier with the gender thing.

250
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 If you as a dude was sitting at a table and someone threw poop all over you, would you think that you would be more or less offended than if you were a girl?

251
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 Like, I think, here's the thing, if somebody threw poop at me, I'd probably be mad, but then later on I'd probably laugh about it.

252
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 I don't know, maybe not laugh about it, but as the years went by, it would probably be a funny story to tell.

253
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 But I think if I was a woman and someone threw poop on me, I'd probably be more aggravated.

254
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 I don't know, that part was also getting cut out, because I could tell as I was saying it, it went absolutely nowhere.

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 It went absolutely nowhere.

256
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 So, and this one of the big weaknesses with the show, honestly, is fixing the stuff.

257
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,800
 Not fixing the stuff, is figuring out sometimes the ending to a segment transition.

258
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 I thought everything was going great for that first 14 minutes, and then the wind kind of started losing, just like any sort of act, any sort of riff.

259
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 The wind starts to fall out of the sails.

260
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 So, I'm going to cut out the part about the gender, and it's funny because now I'll go back and I'll edit, I'll either edit the beginning where I said,

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 "Does it matter if it's a boy or a girl at a table?"

262
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 I may edit that out, but I may leave that, and sometimes I just leave stuff, and then it just goes nowhere.

263
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 So, we're going to edit that part out as well.

264
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 I didn't know if it was going to lead to a joke or some sort of insight into society, and did neither.

265
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 It's more funny that it flopped, and that it was stupid.

266
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 So, we're going to go backwards.

267
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 Now, so they don't know if it's a racial thing.

268
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 They don't think it's a racial thing.

269
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 They think it's most likely a sexual thing.

270
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
 They're not even saying that, but you can't tell me this guy didn't have a huge boner.

271
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 There's no reason why you would do that much work unless it was for a sexual thing.

272
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 I think either you're like an artist, a troll, a revolutionary, or it gives you a boner.

273
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 Those are the only four reasons why you would go out of your way to continue to do this thing.

274
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 He's being charged with five counts of assault, five counts of mischief, interfering with property.

275
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 That is because I think it's all the poop covering the library stuff.

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,800
 Now, I don't know if I -- people have said, like I said, people were saying earlier,

277
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 this isn't going to stop me from going to the library, but I'll be more aware this would stop me from going to a library.

278
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 This would stop me from going to any library ever.

279
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 If I knew there was even a remote chance that while I'm reading like the history of corn,

280
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 some -- I'm going to be inundated.

281
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 Is that a word? Inundated.

282
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 I know it's a word, but inundated, yeah, like, like, rains, rains, rains.

283
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 If I knew there was a chance that if I was sitting down reading Charlotte's Web or any book,

284
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 and I got -- and I would get covered in poop, I would no longer go to the library.

285
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 That is probably the biggest -- what is going on?

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 Okay, so you guys are really seeing the back end stuff.

287
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 That is probably the biggest drawback I would ever have to go in a library.

288
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 That was terrible. So we're going to edit that out as well.

289
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 Probably edit out that whole thing.

290
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Speaking -- okay, so now we have to come up with a segue, and I don't remember where I was at.

291
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 Let's see here.

292
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 So in the end, though, regardless of his motive, he's getting charged with five counts of assault

293
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 and five counts of mischief interfering with property.

294
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 And in the hobo story before, they did have an issue with the victim having to be treated for, like,

295
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 infectious diseases, because feces contain a lot of disgusting stuff, obviously.

296
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 They didn't say that here, but I'm assuming they also had to get all of those tests done and everything like that.

297
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 This guy wasn't homeless, so I'm going to assume that the poop was not as disgusting, but still.

298
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 Any -- anybody's poop would be gross.

299
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 If it was your own poop being dumped on you, I remembered that movie. What was it?

300
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 Not 10,000 BC. That was the one by Roland Emmerich.

301
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 They did that movie with the two kids. It had Michael Cera in it.

302
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 And then was it Jack Black? They were cavemen, and they were fighting Jesus or something like that.

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 One AD or 10 AD or 10 BC or whatever.

304
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 And there was a scene where they were tied up -- one of them was -- they're both in prison, so once tied --

305
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 once chained up, head up like a normal human, the other one's hung upside down,

306
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 and the one who's hung upside down starts peeing all over himself because he has to go to the bathroom.

307
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 It was just a dumb sight gag.

308
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 But I did wonder, could you -- and I think I might have asked this on the show before -- could you poop upside down?

309
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 If you're laying upside down. If you're hung upside down, could you poop?

310
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 And I've actually asked various people that.

311
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 I'm the worst person to -- if you're a doctor, I'm the worst patient to walk in there.

312
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,800
 I don't think I've ever asked a doctor if you can poop upside down, but once I asked --

313
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 and I might have told this story before -- once I asked the nurse,

314
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 she's taken my blood pressure and I go, "If my head got chopped off right now, what would my blood pressure show?"

315
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 And she's like, "Uh, I think that's more of a question for the doctor."

316
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 I.e., "Don't talk to me weirdo."

317
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 And then the doctor came in, you think I would have learned my lesson, but I don't.

318
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 The doctor walks in, I go, "Hey, I have a question for you.

319
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 If my head got chopped off, and you were taking my blood pressure, what would happen?"

320
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 And the doctor looks at me and he goes, "Hmm, it's an interesting question."

321
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 He goes, "Actually, your blood pressure wouldn't drop to zero right away, because it'd still have a couple pumps left."

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 He goes, "But it would drop a lot."

323
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 And then, eventually, he actually gave me a legit answer.

324
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 Because I thought it was like if you poked a hose in a hole, all the pressure's released.

325
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, but it's not immediately released. It just slowly lowers."

326
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 He goes, "But that's an interesting question."

327
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Not many doctors. Not many doctors get questions like that.

328
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 Can you poop upside down, though? I don't know the answer to that question.

329
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 But what I do know the answer to the question is what actually I'm going to give it up to you guys.

330
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 Because this is a live episode, and I think we're going to make it a little bit longer.

331
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 So I'm looking at my comments here.

332
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 I'm going to do a bonus story for this episode, for this special episode.

333
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 And I'm going to let you guys vote on it. I'm going to give you a little bit of time to vote on it.

334
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
 I have the main story about the bagman.

335
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 But right now, I'll let you guys vote on this.

336
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 We can either do a story about a man who was possessed by multiple demons, because he was plain scrabble.

337
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 It's not as funny as the title begets. It's a story of human misery.

338
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Or the conspiracy theory about the pope bringing an ancient idol into Vatican City and bowing before it.

339
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 So you guys can vote on that. I got one vote for pope, two votes for pope, three votes for--

340
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 Okay, there we go. Let me look over my notes here real quick.

341
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
 So this one I'm going to warn you guys, especially you live guys.

342
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 So, you know, I don't talk about politics on the show.

343
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 I obviously follow politics. It's a thing.

344
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 It's possible that this story I could start to veer into a little political thing.

345
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 And generally, I cut it out if I start to get too political.

346
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 But just letting you guys know, I don't think so.

347
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,800
 But we'll probably get into a little bit about the fractures in the church and that can lead into politics and stuff like that.

348
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 So we are leaving behind Toronto, Canada cut.

349
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 So let me actually segue this for the people who are going to listen to this on the podcast.

350
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 So the live people have voted. We're going to do a story about the pope.

351
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 So let's all hop back into the carboner copter.

352
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 You're wiping yourself off and giving you a couple of those little Clorox wipes so you can wipe the poop off you.

353
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 You forgot you got pooped on. And I should have made that segment interactive.

354
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 But no matter whatever you picked, you got pooped on.

355
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 It was just a different consistency. If you picked three, it was extra chunky.

356
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 We're leaving behind Toronto, Canada and its poop filled libraries.

357
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 Hop on the carboner copter. We're going to Vatican City.

358
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 So [panting]

359
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 Landing. In the middle of the square, people are praying. Ah, nuns are running.

360
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 I'm like, get out of the way, religious people.

361
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 Helicopter coming through, landing.

362
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 Now, it's October 4th, 2019. So that's my birthday.

363
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 So imagine me as a 43-year-old man during this story.

364
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 Now, I'm not Catholic. So there's a lot of terminology that I may use incorrectly, if you can believe that.

365
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 If you can believe me ever using a word incorrectly on this show.

366
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 There's a thing called like a synod, and that's apparently where all the bishops of a certain area show up.

367
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 It's a meet and greet. Pope's like, hey guys, what's going on? Doing the secret pope handshake.

368
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 And then, I'm sure there actually is a secret pope handshake.

369
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 It's really like a religious convention. It's not just a meet and greet.

370
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 They get around, they kind of set. So what they're going to talk about and all that stuff.

371
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 They're like, on the meetings today, we're going to talk about God, right?

372
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 And everyone's like, yes, they're like, class dismissed.

373
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 It's October 4th. This one is the Amazonian Synod.

374
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 And all these bishops are getting together, and they're going to talk about Amazon...

375
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 They're all from South America. And obviously, they're ones from Vatican City as well, other parts of the world.

376
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 They're not like kicking the European bishops out of there.

377
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 But it's mostly focused on the Amazonian thing.

378
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 Now, before this starts, this is a huge thing.

379
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 There's in Vatican City, there's a ritual tree planting ceremony.

380
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 And this is where it gets a little political, because right now the church, there's a schism in the Catholic church.

381
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 You have people who are more conservative, who go, "Pope?"

382
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 Who actually... See, here's another tip.

383
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Sometimes I realize, I did this whole story, I don't remember what the name of the pope is.

384
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 It's not Pius. Here, hold on. I got to look that up.

385
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 See, the people who listen to the podcast won't know that I don't know who the current pope is, because I'll edit it in.

386
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 It's Francis, right?

387
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 Yes. So, Pope Francis.

388
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 I want you to imagine that. Oh, no.

389
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 Oh, see, that's another thing. I'll cut out jokes that I think are going to be too inflammatory.

390
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 Done with that one.

391
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 So, let me regain where we are going.

392
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 So, Pope Francis is here for a ritual tree planting ceremony.

393
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 And you go, "Oh, wait, no, no, no. I was explaining the schism thing."

394
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 So, here's the thing. This is where things make a little political.

395
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 Is that there's currently a schism in the church, where you have a conservative branch of the church saying that Pope Francis is way more commuted.

396
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 Pope Francis is way more committed to climate justice and all these kind of weird beliefs, and he didn't fight hard enough against abortion in Ireland, because they recently voted to make that legal.

397
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 He doesn't seem to be in line with traditional Catholicism.

398
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 And then you have another side of Catholicism.

399
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 It's like, it's 2019. It's time that the church addresses stuff like gender pay gap and climate change.

400
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 And that abortion is a woman's right and all this stuff.

401
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 So, you have this schism in the church.

402
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 And the problem is that when people try to criticize Pope Francis, whether it's a legitimate criticism or not, it's generally seen as, "Oh, you're just a conservative."

403
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 And we saw a lot of that pop up during the child sex scandals, which has been something that's plagued Catholicism for all of my life.

404
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:19,800
 I think it really started in the 80s when he started hearing about it, but people were criticizing the way he handled that, and the media was like, "You're just a conservative. You just don't like him because of the climate change stuff."

405
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
 It's super weird.

406
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 So, what happened was Pope Francis is at this ritual tree-planning ceremony. This is in Vatican City.

407
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 You have people bowing to these statues, these statues of naked women, naked pregnant women.

408
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 And the religious media was saying, "This is a story that I just happened to stumble across on a Catholic website."

409
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 Because I heard nothing about this. Not on X, not on fringe conspiracy websites, which is X, nowhere.

410
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,800
 I just kind of stumbled across this. It just happened two months ago.

411
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 People are bowing to these trees. People are bowing to these statues of these naked women.

412
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 Pope is sitting there. He's not far off. He's like in- there's like a circle. He's sitting right outside the circle.

413
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 These people are dressed up in Amazonian clothing, dancing around this tree. It is a ritual. It is 100% a pagan ritual. What's going on?

414
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 Pope Francis blesses one of the statues.

415
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 If you're not a Christian, a big part of Christianity, it's in the Ten Commandments. It's in like the top five.

416
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 Actually, the first, really, the first like four or five commandments are, "Have no other gods before me."

417
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 It's just saying that in different ways. You don't get into the "don't murder" stuff until later.

418
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 You're not supposed to have idols. You're not supposed to have any gods before God.

419
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 And here you have Pope Francis blessing this statue. So, the religious media goes, "It was a statue of Mary. Don't freak out. It's just a statue of Mary."

420
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 But you had the people who don't like Pope Francis, the conservative side of the church, seeing this as just an other symbol of the madness of Pope Francis.

421
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 This statue, so what it is and what the people began researching, because they're like, "There's something wrong here."

422
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,800
 Pope shouldn't be where all these people are dancing around for this tree-planted ceremony. What does the statue represent?

423
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 It's called the Lady, Our Lady of the Amazon, or Pachamama, Pachamama Mother Earth.

424
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 It's the earth goddess of like the Amazonian people. In the South America region, you have the Amazonians, you have other people in that region.

425
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 In their creation myth, they have Pachamama. It's a fertility statue. It's a symbol of Mother Earth.

426
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 And the popes people are like, "It is a statue that represents the Virgin Mary, so quit acting like a big old conspiracy weirdo."

427
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 Now, Pope Francis goes, "I really like those statues." I don't know if he actually said that, okay?

428
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 But he's saying these statues are great. He brings them into a church in Vatican City, which is a huge controversy.

429
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 Because now, not only is he out in the garden during this ritual, and this is what I'm telling you is not conspiracy theory.

430
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 What I'm telling you is photographed and historical. I'm not talking about stuff that happened in the middle of the night.

431
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 You can check out these show notes, see photos of him at this fertility ceremony.

432
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 We're just getting started because he addresses this and everything. No one is saying this didn't happen.

433
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 No one is saying that this is a straight up fake news conspiracy.

434
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 He brings them into a church in the Vatican City, these false idols, these images of Pachamama.

435
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 And the Amazonian Synod is starting.

436
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 So that thing, the tree-planting ceremony took place before the official Synod, where you're going to have all these bishops show up.

437
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 And the thing is, the bishops are not happy about any of this.

438
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,800
 So, where was I going with this? Oh, okay. So it's October 21st.

439
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,800
 The statue, I believe there's two statues of Pachamama.

440
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:33,800
 They are brought into the church of Tras Pontina. The church of Tras Pontina is in the Vatican City.

441
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 It's not like some third-rate church on the outskirts of town. It's not the off-off, broadway version of the Vatican Church.

442
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 It's within Vatican City. Popes and bishops and dudes hang out there all the time. It's basically like a regular church.

443
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 Anyways, the point is, it's October 21st. Who hangs out in the church is not the point. It's October 21st, 2019.

444
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 Two dudes, two guys break into the church late at night. Grab the statue.

445
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 I think there's only one statue at this point. They grab the statue, cut.

446
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 Two dudes break into the church, grab the statue, throw it in the river.

447
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 They are hailed as heroes, as people who have stood up to a corrupt pope.

448
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:29,800
 Because this obviously is huge news. Somebody breaks into a church, steals a relic of a false god that was put there by the pope.

449
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 They throw it in the river. So what does the pope do?

450
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 They fish the statue out of the river. The pope says, he releases a press release.

451
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 He puts out a press release and he goes, "I'm very sorry. We meant no disrespect to the people.

452
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,800
 The statue of Pachamama was not damaged when it was thrown into the water.

453
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:03,800
 And, you know what? I may actually have it present at the final mass of the Synod."

454
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 I just might do that.

455
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 This story is already a massive controversy in the Catholic Church.

456
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 But now he's put even more flames on the fire. Not only did he apologize for it, and he's saying, you know, they shouldn't have broken into the church in the first place.

457
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 That's fine. It's not our property. Someone shouldn't have been thrown into the people's property.

458
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 Shouldn't have been thrown into other OPPs stuff around.

459
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 He said that he may have them at the final mass before these guys were just sitting in the church.

460
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:47,800
 Now he's talking about having them in a mass with him and every other bishop from South America, which people were like that.

461
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
 You can't have these guys sitting here while you're holding a mass.

462
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 But he called the statue Pachamama.

463
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 So there went the entire argument that this was a statue of the Virgin Mary.

464
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 He knew what the statue was. It was a statue of Pachamama. He was at a ritual for it.

465
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
 He blessed it. He put it in a church.

466
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 And when it got disposed of, he apologized for it and assured people that Pachamama was not destroyed.

467
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,800
 Now, again, these people who support Pope Francis goes, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

468
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,800
 He called it Pachamama because that's what everyone else was calling it at this point.

469
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 But he called it Pachamama shorthand. He was using the terminology that his enemies are using.

470
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,800
 Because if he had said this is a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, then people would just be confused.

471
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 He was using the term Pachamama because that's how people think of the statue.

472
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
 A civil war basically starts in the church over this.

473
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 And again, this news is so huge. The Catholic Church, what a lot of people don't know.

474
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 And I could even be ignorant about this as well. But the Catholic Church can and has split.

475
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,800
 And they're actually on the verge of it right now. You could have a breakaway say, "This Pope is the wrong Pope.

476
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 He's going way too far in the other direction. He's doing stuff that is not biblical.

477
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,800
 So we're going to break away." You had bishops.

478
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,800
 And that may go, "Oh, who cares?" You know, Eastman Kodak. They split. Companies split all the time.

479
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,800
 Religions, you have Sunni and Shiite Muslims and stuff like that.

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,800
 He is the... Wow, SK, thank you. Thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Didn't expect that. Thank you.

481
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 Um... Kind of threw me off there for a second.

482
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,800
 The idea is this. The Pope is the voice of God.

483
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,800
 So when he's do... When... It's not like you're like, "Pfft, you suck. I'm leaving the church."

484
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 He is the messenger from God. He is that voice, just like how you have the main prophet in the Mormon Church.

485
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,800
 Most other religions don't have these giant, like, swords in the ground that are these symbols.

486
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,800
 But Catholicism does. So for people to go, "You know what? That's enough. I'm out."

487
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,800
 They're basically saying God's voice is wrong. So there's something deeply wrong going on in that church.

488
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
 I'm not saying there's something deeply going wrong in the church, but that's the view of it.

489
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,800
 So he says we're going to have these statues at this final mass.

490
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:43,800
 And bishops are saying, "If I walk into that church and there is a statue of Pachamama, I'm leaving. I'm out."

491
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:51,800
 And this starts going around. And other bishops start signing a... What? Not a poll. What's the word? Not a declaration.

492
00:35:51,800 --> 00:36:01,800
 It's a petition. Petition. Starts signing a petition saying, "Pope, voice of God, the person who communicates with the Almighty.

493
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 If you do this, I will not show up at this final mass." And Pope is mum on whether or not these statues are going to be there.

494
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 October 27th, 2019. It's the closing mass of the Synod. The statue is not there. There are no statues of Pachamama.

495
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:37,800
 But you have this huge Catholic ceremony. You have this mass. Did I ever tell you guys I went to a private Catholic school?

496
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,800
 I did have to do all that stuff. You're like, "Jayson, don't go on a segue now. This is the conclusion of the show or of this segment.

497
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:53,800
 Don't start going off in random stuff now." So I won't. It's October 27th. It's closing mass. The statues are not there.

498
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 But in the middle of this Catholic ceremony, in the middle of this mass stuff, they have a native woman walk up carrying a bowl of what's known as Pachamama Plains.

499
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:24,800
 It's like a fertility plant representation of the statue. And she walks up and she puts it on the altar in front of the church.

500
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:34,800
 They have a pagan ceremony during this Synod.

501
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 Basically, here's the thing. They say, "Hey, the Pope's like, "Hey man, you said no statues. I gave you no statues."

502
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:58,800
 But you didn't say nothing about no plants. I mean, come on." And the bishops are saying, "One of the weirdest things about all of this is the Pope doesn't seem to care."

503
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:11,800
 It doesn't seem to really... It doesn't disturb him either way. It's not disturbing to him that anyone's upset and it's not disturbing to him that they're having these pagan ceremonies.

504
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 It just doesn't seem to care either way. But the controversy isn't over. This is how I found out about it. This is how I found about it.

505
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:28,800
 Chime Chili. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm getting donation. I got a $20 donation from SK and a $20 donation from Chime Chili.

506
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 I really, really appreciate that, guys. That means a lot. Thank you.

507
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,800
 Yeah, that's not what I expected. I don't want to... Yeah, no, I really appreciate that. That's totally awesome.

508
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:51,800
 When I think about when I started doing this show, it was just such a... I know it's come a long way and I really appreciate you guys listening to it and supporting the show.

509
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,800
 It just means a lot. So I appreciate it. It's been an amazing journey.

510
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:11,800
 November 12, 2019, you have priests, you have scholars begin signing a new petition called the protest against Pope Francis' sacrilegious acts.

511
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:19,800
 And here is a quote. Let me get this... I got to get this set up here. Where's mine?

512
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 Thought not. Thank you very much for your donation. Really, really appreciate it.

513
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 Let me... This is the thing. A lot of times I will get quotes and then I'll have to reread them and see if... At the time when I'm doing my research, sometimes I'll just grab quotes and then as I'm going through it...

514
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:50,800
 Because the story obviously morphs. This one, I was up in the air whether or not I was going to plan it to do it today. But the stories are constantly morphing.

515
00:39:50,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 So sometimes I'll include quotes and sometimes I won't. But let me take a look here. What's the quote here?

516
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:20,800
 Okay, so here is the quote. Here's the quote from Bishop Mutsarts. Mutsarts sounds like a Pokemon. He's some dude from the Netherlands.

517
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:31,800
 But he's some bishop. He's some Iraqi Catholic bishop. But he sounds like someone that would lose to Pikachu. Mutsarts. Mutsarts. Whatever. Sorry, dude.

518
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 Here's this quote. If you read the working document of the so-called Amazon Sinod, it really seems that the intention is for the Sinod to wind up in a new religion, a kind of eco-socialism, an amalgam of ecology, climate change,

519
00:40:48,800 --> 00:41:08,800
 euphemism, which is women ministers. Actually, no, I think the women ministers is the very probati. But anyways, an amalgam of ecology, climate change, euphemism, very probati, consecration of women, and as an afterthought, sometimes a mention of Jesus.

520
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:28,800
 But then not as the son of God and Redeemer, Jesus the philosopher, revolutionary, and hippie. So basically what he's saying, what Bishop Mutsarts is saying is that this seemed to be the first step in radically change,

521
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:45,800
 or actually, as people think Pope Francis has been trying to do this for a while, but trying to blend the Catholic Church with this pagan type religion, turning Jesus into a freedom-loving, which he was a freedom-loving dude, but like a plant-loving hippie dude,

522
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:55,800
 and focusing on the ecology, the climate change, which they did talk about during the Sinod. And I'm not saying that those aren't bad issues to discuss.

523
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:09,800
 You can talk about that stuff, but people feel like you should be talking about Jesus. You should be talking about saving people's souls rather than saving money by not fracking or whatever.

524
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:21,800
 Okay, let me try that one again. Basically, the Catholic Church should focus more on saving people's souls than saving the environment. That's kind of how people feel about it.

525
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 You can do both. The problem is, is that he's thinking that this Bishop Mutsarts and all these other priests are thinking they're focused way too much on environmental stuff.

526
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,800
 Thank you very much for the donation, Barfing Man. That means a lot. In the future, please lower the noise gate. It's coming off at the beginning of some words.

527
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:46,800
 I don't have a noise gate, actually. This is a technical question here. I don't have a noise gate on this. That might be part of it.

528
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,800
 I don't know what it is, but I apologize if you guys are having any trouble hearing this stuff. I apologize.

529
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,800
 So, they're putting out that statement of protest, the protest against Pope Francis' sacrilegious acts.

530
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:11,800
 Now, what's funny is this has... keeps spiraling out of control. This situation keeps spiraling out of control.

531
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:22,800
 On November 11th, the President of Bolivia got overthrown. It's funny because I stumbled across this story and it did end up becoming like this globe-trotting adventure.

532
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:33,800
 November 11th, the President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, gets kicked out of office. That's a whole other just long story corrupt government.

533
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,800
 But while he was in government, he is like, "Hey, have you met my new buddy? Have you met my new pal?" "Pachamama!"

534
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:49,800
 And this President was also talking about Pachamama in the palace. After the Rev... So, you have this revolution go on.

535
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:58,800
 President leaves. They put in a new person in power. Some guys break into the office and destroy Pachamama statue.

536
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,800
 And then they send out a release or they left a video. Maybe they were wearing ski masks or they just smashed at you.

537
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:15,800
 But they made the statement, "Bolivia, cut." They made the statement, "Pachamama will never return to the palace. Bolivia belongs to Christ."

538
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:25,800
 So, if you're having this full-on... I used the term "civil war" earlier.

539
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:34,800
 But you have this struggle where people are raiding offices, raiding political offices, raiding churches, getting rid of statues.

540
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,800
 They're taking physical action. And this is how I found out about this story. We're going to wrap it up like this.

541
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:51,800
 This is how I found out about this story. On December 6th, four exorcists have declared... Wait, December 6th hasn't happened yet.

542
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:59,800
 This is how I found out about this story. I saw a news article that just kind of popped up as I was kind of moving around the internet.

543
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:07,800
 Four exorcists has declared that December 6th is going to be a day of prayer for the Catholic Church.

544
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,800
 You're like, "That's every Sunday. That's every day if you're an old Italian woman. Every day is a day of prayer."

545
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 Excuse me.

546
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,800
 Thank you, Bishi Bashi. Thank you so much for the donation.

547
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,800
 And everyone else, I'm going to read through your comment. I've been kind of looking over at the comments, but I'm definitely going to dig through them later.

548
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:42,800
 And I have gotten some story suggestions out of them and stuff like that, so I really appreciate that.

549
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:50,800
 These four exorcists have declared that December 6th should be a day of prayer.

550
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:59,800
 And they left this. This is how they started off their speech. They should really let you know how people are viewing this whole situation.

551
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,800
 In light of the recent events regarding the Pachamama ritual in the Vatican Gardens, that's when I was like...

552
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,800
 Because I was like, "Oh, these exorcists are going to pray for the church. What's going on?"

553
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,800
 When I read that first sentence, I'm like, "What?" And then I went and I did all that research.

554
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,800
 Because I was like, "What?" They assumed you know what the Pachamama ritual was.

555
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,800
 I read that and I was like, "What are they talking about?"

556
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,800
 And then all this just news kind of poured out.

557
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:32,800
 In light of the recent events regarding the Pachamama ritual in the Vatican Gardens, the subsequent procession of the idol into St. Peter's,

558
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,800
 as well as placing the idols in St. Maria and Transpontina Church,

559
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,800
 we are reminded of the words of St. Paul, 1 Corinthians 10-20.

560
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:50,800
 "Do I say..." What... "Do I say that what is offered and sacrificed to idols is anything?"

561
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,800
 Or that the idol is anything?

562
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,800
 "But the things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God."

563
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,800
 "And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils."

564
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:12,800
 So he's basically these four exorcists come out guns blazing.

565
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:21,800
 The Pope is partaking with devils.

566
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,800
 Here's the next quote. This is also in their press release.

567
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,800
 The Psalms 95, what would that be? Book chapter 95 verse 5.

568
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,800
 "Tell us that all the gods of the Gentiles are devils, but the Lord made the heavens."

569
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,800
 These events bring home the reality that our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,

570
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,800
 but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness,

571
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,800
 against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.

572
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:01,800
 These events bring home the reality that we are in spiritual warfare and that warfare is happening within the church itself.

573
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:10,800
 We are therefore encouraging all Catholics who recognize the evil of the events to join us in a day of prayer and penance on December 6th

574
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:22,800
 for the purpose of driving out any diabolical influence within the church that has been gained as a result of these recent events, along with other events.

575
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:37,800
 Shots fired. Like just by the Pope doing this is in consort with devils and has opened the church up to demonic possession.

576
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,800
 The Catholic Church could fracture within our lifetime.

577
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:53,800
 I mean, it is very possible that the next generation will have a radically different Catholic Church instead of this giant monolith type of thing,

578
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:02,800
 which again, with that much money and that much power at stake, it could get bad.

579
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,800
 It could get real bad.

580
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,800
 We talk about, oh, Civil War, Liberals and Conservatives in America.

581
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:21,800
 I mean, I would put my money more that there would be a shooting war over the Catholic religion before there would be a shooting war in America.

582
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:32,800
 But I mean, when they're calling on Catholics to pray that the Pope isn't possessed by the devil too much.

583
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
 So that'll be December 6th.

584
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,800
 If you're a practicing Catholic and you, I almost said practicing Cactus.

585
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,800
 If you're a practicing Catholic and you believe that the Pope has strayed, December 6th is the day to pray about it.

586
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
 Insane.

587
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:58,800
 We'll keep following that story though, but we are now going to move on to our final story of our special Thanksgiving episode.

588
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:13,800
 [silence]

589
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
 Let's go ahead.

590
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
 We're hot back in the Carbondocopter.

591
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,800
 Actually, you know what?

592
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
 We're close enough.

593
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,800
 Let's just hop in the Jason Jalopy.

594
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,800
 We'll drive from Vatican City.

595
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,800
 We are going to Spain.

596
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
 We're going back in time.

597
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,800
 We're going to June 28th, 1910.

598
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,800
 We're headed to a little region called Gator, which sounds like some really kind of cool place in Middle Earth.

599
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:44,800
 I had a really weird Mandela effect thing the other day because I was doing all the--

600
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,800
 you notice all weeks have been stories that take place in Spain and they kept referring to stuff like I shouldn't know it.

601
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
 It was really weird.

602
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,800
 They were to be like, "Oh, this person lived in Alentasia.

603
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
 Where the hell's Alentasia?

604
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
 What is that?"

605
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
 And then I was looking into it and I'm like, "Oh, it's some province in Spain?

606
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
 Why did you assume I would know that?"

607
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
 It didn't even say like, "Alentasia, Spain."

608
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
 It was just like the traveler for a while.

609
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
 I was like, "What?"

610
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,800
 I was like, "Did I get teleported into a reality where I should have all this information?"

611
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:19,800
 [silence]

612
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
 We're going to Gator.

613
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,800
 It's June 28, 1910.

614
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,800
 And there's a man there named Francisco Ortega L. Moruno.

615
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,800
 He's diagnosed with ter--

616
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,800
 He's diagnosed with tuberculosis, a death sentence really back then.

617
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
 And not a great-- not a great sentence to hear nowadays either.

618
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,800
 It's not like you're like, "Yes, just tuberculosis."

619
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,800
 It's still pretty rough.

620
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800
 I wonder if you can get tuberculosis by swallowing someone's diarrhea.

621
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
 I wonder if-- I mean, that's not something that I want to test.

622
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
 It's not even something I want to Google.

623
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,800
 But I want-- I mean, it's mucus-based, right?

624
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
 There's a lot of mucus in poop.

625
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,800
 Anyways, nothing to do with the story.

626
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,800
 This guy ends up-- he's like, "Ugh, I'm tired. I got the consumption.

627
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
 My lungs-- my lungs are full of blood and mucus or whatever.

628
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,800
 Jason, thanks to tuberculosis."

629
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,800
 All of my knowledge of tuberculosis comes from

630
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,800
 Mulan Rouge, Tombstone,

631
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,800
 and then one of my relatives had tuberculosis a long time ago.

632
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,800
 You think I would have listed that one first,

633
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,800
 but I remember I was told my uncle had tuberculosis,

634
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,800
 and I was like, "Oh, I hadn't seen Mulan Rouge or Tombstone yet,

635
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
 so I didn't really know what that meant."

636
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,800
 Anyways, Francisco is sent to another dude named Francisco.

637
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,800
 So what's going to-- his name's Francisco Leona,

638
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
 so we'll call him Leona from here on out.

639
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,800
 He's one of those healers, one of those old men who's like--

640
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,800
 not a doctor, not like, you know, like a snake oil salesman,

641
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,800
 like a fake guy, but you'd be lucky if this guy--

642
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,800
 this wouldn't be a story if he was a snake oil salesman.

643
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,800
 He's actually a human fat expert.

644
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,800
 And this is how I got started on my whole story about Spain

645
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
 having a problem with sucking people's fat out.

646
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,800
 This was-- this is where the origin story-- this is the prequel.

647
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,800
 And this one, I'm doing a little true crime setup,

648
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,800
 and then we're going to wrap it up with an absolutely bizarre phenomenon.

649
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
 An absolutely bizarre phenomenon.

650
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,800
 So Francisco goes to Leona and says,

651
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,800
 "Hey, man, can you get rid of my tuberculosis?"

652
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,800
 And Leona goes, "I can, but you're going to have to pay me some of that sweet, sweet--"

653
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,800
 I think it's called reels, reowls or whatever.

654
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,800
 It doesn't exist anymore, so it doesn't matter.

655
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,800
 He goes, "You're going to have to pay me some of that sweet, sweet Spanish currency

656
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,800
 because I have the cure for you,

657
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,800
 but we're going to need some stuff."

658
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
 And Francisco's like, "Whatever, whatever you need,

659
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
 because I don't want to dive tuberculosis."

660
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,800
 And Leona goes, "Sure.

661
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
 All we need is to kill a little boy."

662
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,800
 He goes, "I'm sorry, wait, what did you say?

663
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,800
 Was that pass-- oh, nothing, nothing, just kill a little boy and take his fat."

664
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
 Wait, what?

665
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
 But he was actually on board,

666
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
 and when he finally did go, we have to kill a little boy and take his fat.

667
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
 Francisco goes, "So that's what I thought you said.

668
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
 Okay, cool, I'm totally down with that.

669
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
 I thought you said kill a cat.

670
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,800
 You know what? I've never-- oh, God, I hate it when people go,

671
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,800
 'Oh, I could kill a human,' but I could never hurt an animal."

672
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,800
 I call them out all the time.

673
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
 All the time when somebody says, "I go now, you can't."

674
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
 I might have said that on a previous--

675
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,800
 I go off on tangents all the time and then end up editing them out for time.

676
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
 But not to the point where people, when they go,

677
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
 "Is it a people tell me all the time they could murder other people?"

678
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,800
 And my answer used to just be ignoring them.

679
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,800
 I never really-- because everyone's, "Oh, you know, if I could, I'd take human life."

680
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
 And now I actively challenge them.

681
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
 I go, "No, you couldn't."

682
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,800
 Now, to be fair, the people I'm doing this to aren't like six foot tall bikers.

683
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,800
 They don't have like teardrop tattoos on their faces,

684
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,800
 little tattoos on the inside of their hand.

685
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
 No.

686
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,800
 These are people who have never even been in a fist fight in their life.

687
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,800
 They'll be like, "You know, like, I'd have the darkness inside of me."

688
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,800
 I don't know if it's because they know that I read true crime and stuff like that.

689
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,800
 This is not impressing me.

690
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,800
 "Oh, I have the darkness inside of me. I could take a human life."

691
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,800
 I'll be like, "No, you can't."

692
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,800
 I'll straight up tell them, "No, you can't."

693
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,800
 And they'll be like, "Yes, I could. I could told."

694
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
 And I'll say, "Listen, I'll give you this.

695
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,800
 If someone broke in your house and it was a life or death situation,

696
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
 you could probably take them out.

697
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
 You probably wouldn't worry about that.

698
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,800
 But you could in no way plan and execute a murder.

699
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,800
 And then they start to interrupt me and I go, "And, and, live with it afterwards.

700
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
 There's no possible way you can do that.

701
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,800
 I could. I've got the darkness inside of me."

702
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,800
 And then I'll usually say, "Okay, let's go to the animal shelter

703
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
 and you can pick up a cat and drown it."

704
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,800
 Oh, no, no. I've had this conversation so many times.

705
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
 It's so bizarre.

706
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
 I don't know if people are trying to impress me.

707
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,800
 By, first off, I'm not impressed by someone who can murder somebody else.

708
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
 Gorillas can kill each other.

709
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,800
 And yeah, that's pretty cool because they're super strong.

710
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,800
 But I'm not, that doesn't impress me.

711
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,800
 The fact that you think you're some like dark, avenging angel

712
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
 or just some psychopath or whatever, you watch too many episodes of Dexter.

713
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,800
 I don't, it does not impress me.

714
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,800
 But I'll always go, "Okay, well then, you know, go kill an animal."

715
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,800
 And they'll be like, "Which I do not advocate killing animals, obviously."

716
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,800
 And they go, "Oh, no, no. I could never hurt an animal.

717
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,800
 Animals are without sin and they're precious."

718
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,800
 And I'm thinking, "I've never been bitten by a snake, then have you?"

719
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,800
 But anyways, but a human sins and a human does bad things and all that stuff.

720
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,800
 And I go, "Listen, you know, the Russian special forces,

721
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,800
 they give you a cat when you start and at the end of training

722
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
 you have to snap the cat's neck.

723
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,800
 And with the US special forces they do the same thing, but it's a chicken.

724
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,800
 You're given a chicken, a little baby chicken you have to raise.

725
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
 And at the end of the training you have to kill it.

726
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,800
 That is just the, you have to have no,

727
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,800
 it's really, really difficult to walk up behind somebody

728
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
 and stick a knife in the back of their head.

729
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
 It's incredibly hard.

730
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,800
 It's evolutionary, something that has to be trained into us.

731
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,800
 So no, you can't just walk down the street and kill somebody.

732
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,800
 Why was, why are we talking about this?

733
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,800
 Killing people, killing cats.

734
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,800
 Oh, oh, because yeah, I was making a joke about this guy.

735
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,800
 He'd be fine with killing a boy, but wouldn't want to kill a cat.

736
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
 That's, okay, that's where the came from.

737
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,800
 Anyways, that's keeping it a little light because now where the story gets really dark,

738
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:47,800
 Leona goes and he gets a guy, he hires a sidekick, an assistant.

739
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,800
 Now you are about to commit a crime where you have to kill a young child

740
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,800
 for a cure of a disease.

741
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,800
 Would you?

742
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
 This is a rhetorical question.

743
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,800
 This guy obviously hired this guy.

744
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:08,800
 But would you hire a guy named Julio El Tonto Hernandez?

745
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,800
 Now if you speak Spanish, you can, you saw the trick in there.

746
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:21,800
 Because Julio El Tonto Hernandez, El Tonto means the fool.

747
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:27,800
 So why would you, hmm, I need to commit the perfect crime and not get caught.

748
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,800
 I'm about to kill this boy and take his fat out.

749
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,800
 I'm going to hire a guy, his nickname means idiot.

750
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,800
 But he does, he gets Julio down at the schoolyard and Leona, they go out,

751
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,800
 they kidnap this 70 year old boy named Bernardo Gonzales Para.

752
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,800
 And this is one of those heartbreaking things.

753
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
 He's at the river with a bunch of other kids.

754
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:57,800
 And Leona and El Tonto are like, hey kids, who wants to help us pick peaches?

755
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,800
 And Bernardo goes, I'll do it.

756
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,800
 And you have to, how horrible is that?

757
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,800
 Like it's one thing when a kid's walking down the street and they get kidnapped and stuff like that.

758
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,800
 And you're like, as a parent, that's such a painful moment.

759
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,800
 This isn't funny. This is terrible.

760
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,800
 I think it's even more painful in a group of kids because then everyone's kind of afraid.

761
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
 Like it could have been anyone's kid.

762
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,800
 I don't know. That segue was super dark.

763
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,800
 There's a reason why I don't like doing true crime, but this is leading somewhere.

764
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,800
 He ends up, they end up killing the kid and they end up taking out his fat.

765
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
 And I'm not going to go into details about how he's murdered or anything like that.

766
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
 That's really not the point.

767
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,800
 The point is, is that this boy was murdered and they take out his human fat.

768
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,800
 And they use it. They take out all this gooey fat.

769
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:54,800
 And then they just put it on Francisco's chest like it's that vapor rub.

770
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,800
 And they just rub it around and they go put this on your chest, leave it here.

771
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,800
 Your tuberculosis will be cured.

772
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,800
 What? You're not even going to like ground it up and turn it into some sort of magical paste?

773
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,800
 You're just going to put kid fat on me?

774
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
 I think you got lazy halfway through.

775
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:17,800
 I think he realized that he was just wanted some money because he ended up, if my math is correct,

776
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:25,800
 Leona ended up getting paid like $18,000 for this work.

777
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,800
 Not like American money, but if my math is correct, because this currency doesn't exist anymore,

778
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:35,800
 so I had to do some weird stuff plus some terrible math, but the idea is this.

779
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,800
 They put the compress on. Now he gets the money and Leona gives some of the money to El Tonto.

780
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,800
 And then El Tonto goes, I want more money.

781
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,800
 And Leona goes, this is just classic true crime blundering.

782
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:59,800
 Leona goes, no. So El Tonto goes to the police and says the other day I was out chasing partridges around.

783
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:06,800
 I was looking for little birds to catch in my hands and I found a body and I'll show you where it's at.

784
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,800
 And so he leads the cops out there and this is so depressing.

785
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:18,800
 And this will happen from time to time. I'll be doing a segment and I'm like, this isn't funny.

786
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,800
 This is kind of sad, but anyways we're almost to the creepy stuff.

787
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,800
 I mean that stuff is all creepy as well, but he leads them to the body.

788
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,800
 I'm going to start speeding it through this because it can get a little boring.

789
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,800
 The cops realize that Leona is known in town for being a black magician.

790
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,800
 They see this body has what seems to be ritual attack murder stuff like that.

791
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,800
 They go, they arrest Leona. Leona implicates El Tonto.

792
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,800
 They both implicate each other. Everyone's found guilty. Francisco is found guilty as well.

793
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,800
 He dies in prison and everyone else is hung except El Tonto.

794
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:56,800
 He's considered too insane and he's pardoned because he's an idiot in the end.

795
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,800
 So why am I telling you that story? We got done with Spanish Fat Week.

796
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,800
 Why am I telling you that story?

797
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:11,800
 Because that story got wrapped up in The Man with the Bag, or the Backman.

798
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:23,800
 Leona is considered one of the typical Spanish bagman. So what's the bagman?

799
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:31,800
 You know in those movies where it's like there's the conspiracy theorist guy and he's like tying the string up on the board and he has all the newspaper articles.

800
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,800
 Or when you're watching a movie, a horror movie like Sinister and they're like,

801
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:44,800
 here's the locations of the ten last demon attacks and here's the location of the last ten families that go missing and put a little overlay.

802
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:51,800
 They appear. That's how I felt about this bagman story.

803
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,800
 So we're going to leave behind Leona because that's just an example.

804
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,800
 That's a real life example where people goes, he was a bagman.

805
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,800
 He was the old man with the bag and he was also considered a real life version of a sacramenteka.

806
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:15,800
 So that's kind of wrapping up the whole Spanish Fat expedition.

807
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:25,800
 All over the world there's a story of a man with a bag.

808
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:32,800
 And you may go, Jason that's fine. Okay, I don't care. It's not affecting my life.

809
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:38,800
 When we look at stories like Chupacabra, Chupacabra is something that exists.

810
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,800
 It doesn't exist. It's totally proven to be false, but the legend exists in South America and the American Southwest.

811
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:50,800
 There's no stories of a Chupacabra in Greenland or Australia.

812
01:03:50,800 --> 01:04:01,800
 Fairies, little magical imps exist in Northern Europe, Greenland, but you don't hear similar stories in Mongolia.

813
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:08,800
 The Yeti, the Bigfoot only appears in certain parts of the globe.

814
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:15,800
 But there is one creature that is everywhere.

815
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:24,800
 And not only is it everywhere, it is described exactly the same.

816
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:33,800
 A fairy in Northern Europe is different than a gnome type creature in South America.

817
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:42,800
 The abominable snowman, the Yeti, is different than the American Bigfoot.

818
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:53,800
 Europe, South America, Asia, Haiti, Africa, Spain.

819
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:59,800
 El hombre del saco, the man with the sack is how he's known in Spain.

820
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:05,800
 South America, El Vijo del saco, the old man with the bag.

821
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:18,800
 Hungary, Zaskos Ember, person with the sack. Lebanon, Abu Aikiz, the man with the bag.

822
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:25,800
 Vietnam, Ong Bob B, Mr. Three Bags.

823
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:38,800
 India, Bori Baba, Father Sack, Sri Lanka, Ghani Billa, Sack Kidnapper.

824
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:46,800
 You could not get any different as far as regions go between Vietnam,

825
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:56,800
 Antunesia, Tanzania, Algeria, Buchkar, Bagman.

826
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:04,800
 All of these regions, all of these countries have these stories of a man with a bag.

827
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,800
 You can't get any different. You can say sure.

828
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:14,800
 The stories of a bagman in Spain being the same thing as a bagman in Northern Europe.

829
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:21,800
 It was cultural contamination. It was people, Sri Lanka, Hungary, Lebanon, South America.

830
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:27,800
 There is not a region in the world where there have been human settlements,

831
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,800
 where there is not a story of a bagman.

832
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:40,800
 What's interesting is that these stories are so universal.

833
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:47,800
 And they're not considered a cryptid, a spirit, a demon, but a maniac.

834
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,800
 A man who exists for one purpose, to steal children.

835
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,800
 Jason, Jason, but they were kidnappers. That's part of real life.

836
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:04,800
 Kidnapping for the sake of kidnapping is a fairly recent event when we're talking historically.

837
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:19,800
 Most kidnapping was done for food, for money, but just to even kidnapping for sex in a scale is more recent than...

838
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,800
 I mean, yes, cavemen did bash each other's heads in and take their wives and stuff like that.

839
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,800
 I'm talking about the lone predator, the creepy kidnapper.

840
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,800
 This stuff is all fairly recent in human development.

841
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,800
 But all of these cultures have a story about a man with a bag.

842
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,800
 They all believe it to be human.

843
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:49,800
 But it's so weird that it's always the same type of character.

844
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:59,800
 And what's interesting too is we all know about the most famous bagman, Santa Claus.

845
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:13,800
 So the bagman is so ingrained into human culture that one of children's greatest heroes is a man with a bag.

846
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:20,800
 So what is it about that imagery? What is it about that you can have...?

847
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:29,800
 Here's the thing. If it was just the story of the neighborhood weirdo, and Sri Lanka, it would be neighborhood weirdo in their language.

848
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,800
 And in English, it would be something else.

849
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,800
 All of these words describe a man with a sack.

850
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:43,800
 And all of these characters, they're old, they're evil, they're indigenous.

851
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:49,800
 So it's not like the Pish Takos that started off as a white conquistador.

852
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:59,800
 These are all... And Sri Lanka, it is a person of that ethnicity with a sack taking children.

853
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:06,800
 But you go to Hungary, it's someone, it's a Hungarian with a sack taking children.

854
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,800
 Not just any children, by the way. They take disobedient children.

855
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,800
 And you go, "Jason, that's... you're kind of shooting holes in your own argument."

856
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,800
 Actually, Jason, I don't even know what the argument is yet. Well, I'm building to that, but...

857
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:24,800
 The idea is this, be good kids, or the sack man will get you.

858
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:34,800
 And not only that, in a lot of these regions, the parents willingly give their children to this man with a sack, because they're bad.

859
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:39,800
 In the Netherlands, who have their own version of the sack man, they take...

860
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:50,800
 This is one of the weirdest connections, and I feel like I'm still tying string up on a bulletin board.

861
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,800
 All of these places have stories about a man with a sack.

862
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,800
 And yes, people have really used sacks.

863
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,800
 The story that I just told you, the true crime story, one of the things I glazed over actually, what glossed over, I think is the word.

864
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:13,800
 Not glazed over, that's what you do to a donut, is that they use chloroform to take out that little boy, throw him in a sack, toss him in a sack, carry him away.

865
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:22,800
 But I still... I still feel like I'm... I still feel like everything's connected.

866
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:32,800
 In the Netherlands, their version of the sack man, you get kidnapped, and you get taken to Spain.

867
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:46,800
 Be good, kids, otherwise you're going to end up as a Spanish guy, and actually, sometimes they take you and they turn you into a black dude in the Netherlands.

868
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,800
 You go in the sack and you become one of Sinterklaas' helper, which is Black Peter.

869
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,800
 So that's just a whole, whole weirdness involved there.

870
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
 You are bad in the Netherlands.

871
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:03,800
 The more you're bad in the Netherlands, you go to Spain, and I think the implications become moreish.

872
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:13,800
 And then you are traveled back up to the Netherlands to help Sinterklaas hand out gifts, yet another bag man in this whole mythology.

873
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:21,800
 I think that the bag man is real.

874
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:28,800
 I think that the bag man is a boogeyman.

875
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,800
 I think that the bag man is a boogeyman that is so... it's a...

876
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:43,800
 It's basically a cryptid that is so hyper-evolved, it's everywhere, it's undetectable.

877
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:56,800
 Not only do people not perceive it as being a cryptid or some sort of mythological creature, it's that they see it as being human.

878
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,800
 A weird human, a creepy human.

879
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:10,800
 And they see it as something fully integrated into their society, their myths.

880
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:20,800
 Nobody ever says, well maybe some parents do, go to bed, otherwise the boogeyman's gonna eat your brains.

881
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,800
 But people will say, "You better go to sleep or the bag man will get you."

882
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,800
 I've heard stories about the bag man when I was a kid.

883
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:39,800
 And if it was just something that was in one region of the world, I would think it was just...

884
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,800
 A goofy story like the melon heads that people told, big brothers passed down through generations.

885
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:52,800
 But the story of the bag man has existed for hundreds of years across the globe.

886
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
 That is not a coincidence.

887
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:04,800
 It's not even a coincidence that all these stories involve somebody kidnapping people and using a bag.

888
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,800
 Am I reading too much into this?

889
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,800
 I just think it's so...

890
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,800
 I think there's something true about this.

891
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:30,800
 I think there might be something living in human society that has remained so undetected for so long that people use it to frighten their children.

892
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,800
 But when in reality it's something that could...

893
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,800
 It would be the equivalent of if there was a rabbit dog in your neighborhood.

894
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,800
 And then you use that to be like, "Hey Billy, you better come home for the street lights. Come on."

895
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,800
 You heard about that rabbit dog escaping the neighborhood.

896
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,800
 It doesn't mean that the rabbit dog's not dangerous. It's simply that you're using it as a tool.

897
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,800
 I have believed, and I said this a very long time ago on the podcast,

898
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,800
 that I think that the boogeyman is real.

899
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,800
 And I said, because every culture has a version of the boogeyman.

900
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,800
 But really that was kind of a vague statement. I couldn't really back that up.

901
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,800
 I can back this up.

902
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,800
 Every culture has a story about a man with a bag who kidnaps children.

903
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:20,800
 Every culture has a story about a man with a bag who kidnaps children.

904
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,800
 Not just a man who kidnaps children.

905
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:30,800
 Because that would just be something that just happens unfortunately.

906
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,800
 All of these people, it is built into their name.

907
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,800
 The man with a bag. The sack man. The person with the sack.

908
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,800
 Father's sack. Mr. Three Bag. Sack kidnapper.

909
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,800
 It is built into the name that is not a coincidence.

910
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:51,800
 There is something out there in human society that hunts children and carries them away with a bag.

911
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,800
 The boogeyman is real.

912
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,800
 He exists.

913
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:03,800
 And we could use him to get kids to behave and do their homework and eat their vegetables and stuff like that.

914
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:12,800
 It doesn't negate the fact that every culture on the planet has a story about a malevolent figure that kidnaps children and puts them in a sack.

915
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,800
 The best cut.

916
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:24,800
 The best case scenario is that it is just a legend that adults think is funny and it's useful and they tell it.

917
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:30,800
 And every so often a real life murderer like Leona puts a kid in a bag.

918
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:36,800
 And it reminds people, young and old, that the bag man is real.

919
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,800
 But just that guy. The legend, the boogeyman.

920
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,800
 He's still a child's myth.

921
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,800
 That's the best case scenario.

922
01:15:46,800 --> 01:16:00,800
 The worst case scenario is that someday you could be walking through your neighborhood alone and you hear someone walking behind you.

923
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,800
 Heavy footsteps. Old footsteps.

924
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,800
 Ancient footsteps.

925
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,800
 And when you turn around you see nothing there.

926
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:20,800
 And when you turn forward to continue your journey, black felt cloth blocks your vision.

927
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:29,800
 You feel yourself being lifted off your feet by an impossibly strong creature of old.

928
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,800
 The worst case scenario is you end up in the bag.

929
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,800
 And then the bag is opened.

930
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,800
 And the next thing you know.

931
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,800
 You're in Spain.

932
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,800
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.

933
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,800
 You can also hit us up at facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

934
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,800
 Twitter is @deadrabbitradio.

935
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,800
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

936
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

937
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,800
 But I'm so glad you listened to it today.

938
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,800
 Thank you for watching the live Thanksgiving stream.

939
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,800
 Sorry about the technical problems in the middle of it, but I really appreciate it.

940
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,800
 Thank you so much everyone and have a happy Thanksgiving.

941
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,800
 I will see you next week.

942
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,800
 No, thank you guys.

943
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,800
 Thanks for watching the live broadcast.

944
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
 That was really cool.

945
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
 That was actually a lot of fun.

946
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,800
 Definitely had a different energy to it.

947
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,800
 That Pope story I think was probably the longest part to it.

948
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,800
 But I'm glad you guys stuck around.

949
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,800
 No, happy Thanksgiving to you guys.

950
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,800
 That was totally awesome.

951
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,800
 I had a lot of fun.

952
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,800
 I got my DeadRabbit.

953
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,800
 I don't know if you guys have been able to see this.

954
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,800
 But I'm not going to freestyle.

955
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,800
 I never got a big freestyle.

956
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,800
 There's my DeadRabbit merch shirt right here.

957
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
 Check that out.

958
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
 Thank you, Sephora.

959
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,800
 But yeah, I'm trying to think.

960
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
 There was something else.

961
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,800
 No, I'm not going to freestyle.

962
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,800
 I never freestyle the back when I did that.

963
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,800
 I always said I had nothing to gain and everything to lose freestyle.

964
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
 I just never got in.

965
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,800
 That Pope story was good.

966
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,800
 I stumbled across that.

967
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,800
 It was one of those stories like I was like, "What is going on?"

968
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,800
 It's funny.

969
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:30,800
 I actually today got a lead on another story involving the Pope and an idol.

970
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
 But I didn't want to give that one away.

971
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,800
 I actually recommended it because I haven't done research on it.

972
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
 I just looked into it.

973
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,800
 Thank you, Eric.

974
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,800
 I'm going to go back and I'll read through these comments and everything like that.

975
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,800
 I'm glad you guys enjoyed the show.

976
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,800
 I thought there was something else I was going to do.

977
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
 Sorry about the internet.

978
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,800
 I expected on Thanksgiving a lot of people were streaming and stuff like that.

979
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,800
 That was a good hour and a half long episode.

980
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,800
 There was a technical issue, but I'm glad you guys stuck around for that.

981
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,800
 I was thinking about doing something else after this.

982
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,800
 Here, I'll give you guys the options of doing this.

983
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
 I don't think it will be as...

984
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,800
 I don't know how exciting it will be.

985
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,800
 I don't know how exciting it will be.

986
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:33,800
 But if you want, maybe for another short amount of time.

987
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,800
 I don't know.

988
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,800
 Let me think if I want to even propose this.

989
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,800
 I still got to edit this episode.

990
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:49,800
 I thought about watching something with you guys, but I don't know about the copyright stuff.

991
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:56,800
 I'm all storied out broken.

992
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
 That was a long episode.

993
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
 I still got to edit it.

994
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,800
 The Scrabble Demon will save until next week.

995
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:11,800
 I was thinking about watching some short scary movies with you guys.

996
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:20,800
 I don't know how it would affect the channel as far as copyright.

997
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:32,800
 I think that I am going to go and take care of some stuff.

998
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,800
 I might be on tomorrow night.

999
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:41,800
 I think we might do a Minecraft livestream tomorrow.

1000
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
 I know you guys aren't a huge fan of those.

1001
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,800
 I like to play Minecraft every once in a while.

1002
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,800
 We got that figured out.

1003
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,800
 I thought about that, Ian, watching an old public domain horror movie.

1004
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,800
 We could watch Night of Living Dead.

1005
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,800
 That's public domain.

1006
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,800
 I wouldn't have a problem with that.

1007
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,800
 I would need to end this livestream and start up another one.

1008
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:12,800
 It really depends if you guys wanted to watch Night of Living Dead.

1009
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,800
 I'll let you guys think about that.

1010
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
 I'm going to...

1011
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,800
 I'll be right back.

1012
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,800
 I'm going to keep it streaming.

1013
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:32,800
 Go ahead and put in the show notes.
