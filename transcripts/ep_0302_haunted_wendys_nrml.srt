1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 The US Army warns its service members that if they want to see the movie Joker, they better be prepared to fight.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at an interesting story of a man who traveled to an alternate dimension simply to buy some McDonald's.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And that dovetails into a story, a personal story of mine I like to call the Haunted Windies, today on Dead Ravvr Radio.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 *Dead Ravvr Radio plays*

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravvr Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So the other day I did an episode about UFOs, drones being spotted over Iranian power plants. I do have to make a slight correction of that story.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The story itself I stand by, the story itself was reported, but the video that I talked about is actually video of a, like a, barbecue in Texas?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I talked about this video, it was only like maybe 10 seconds of the episode, but I talked about a video you see in this drone flying around on all this anti-aircraft fire.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Turns out it was just a bunch of hillbillies trying to shoot down an RC drone, so that was my mistake for including that example.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But the story itself I still stand by, just the video that I talked about briefly, that was fake.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So when that type of stuff happens, I'm not gonna try to cover it up, I will admit that video itself is fake, but I'm gonna leave it in the episode and then people will hear this correction and go,

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 "That is a man of integrity." Or a man who doesn't really look into videos. Which is why I don't feature a lot of videos, because they're honestly one of the easiest things to fake.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So, that correction being done. Let's go ahead and move on to our first story. Now our first story is very near and dear to my heart.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 October 4th is my birthday, 9 days from now, I will be 43 years old. Feel free to sing happy birthday wherever you're at, and it will magically come to me, it will make me feel good.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I'll get all these, I'll be like, "Ugh!" These shivers as I'm walking around, I'll spend the whole day just quivering.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 October 4th is also the release date for the movie The Joker, which I've been waiting for, I really hope it's good dude.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 There's a chance I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna be super bummed out, I'm like, "Ugh! I'll show you Joker movie!" Actually I shouldn't do that, because that's kind of the point of our next story.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But I'm really looking forward to the movie The Joker, or Joker, I guess it's better way, because that's the actual title, but really looking forward to that movie.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I really, really love the character of the Joker, we've talked about that before. I love, I think he works best as a foil to Batman, he would be a terrible Spider-Man villain, or horrible Fantastic Four villain, but he's the perfect foil for the world's greatest detective, because he is complete chaos, he's totally outside the box.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 He is the box, and outside of it, and he's just, he's, anyways, you guys get it. So, I could go on and on about Joker. I'm sure I will do a Joker review, so if the movie sucks, it'll be a two hour long episode, because I just rip into it.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What happened on Tuesday of this week is the US Army released a memo, and it was listed as official release only, but of course, you know, it was an email that went out to the service members, and somebody leaked it.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So, let me, let me tell you a little bit about this memo here, so they released this memo, and what happened was the FBI, here's a quote from this memo, the FBI, quote, "discovered disturbing and highly specific chatter in the dark web, regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the Joker release."

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So, it seemed that this threat was coming out of Texas, or was directed towards Texas, the Lone Star State, but they released this message, and then the US military, the US Army said, listen, if something happened, when you're going into the theater, identify two points of exit, they're like, remember when you went to go see the love guru in the theater, and you were looking to try to escape the whole time, do that.

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Imagine Joker is the love guru, and you just can't wait to leave that theater. At any moment, you might have to get up and walk out, because that movie was garbage, so this is technically from now on, going to be called the love guru memorandum.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And they said, now I've got to change back to actual seriousness, they said go in and identify two points of exit, and you do the run hide fight, so you do what they call the run hide fight.

26
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So, your first case of action is to get out of the theater, second case of action, if you can't get out of the theater, is to conceal yourself, you wear your ghillie suit to the movie theater, you just have popcorn stuck to it. I know you guys are thinking, Jason, you're making fun of a possible mass shooting, trying to just keep it light.

27
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 You can hide, and this is good advice for anyone in a mass shooting, really. First thing you should do is try to run away, second, if you can't run away, you should conceal yourself somewhere, third, if you can't do either of those things, fight back. That's pretty normal stuff.

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So, the memo goes on to say this, so they're saying that the person or persons targeting the movie theater are incels, which are involuntary celibates, it's a slang term or an actual term for someone who is involuntarily celibate, they want to have sex but they can't, and this is what the memo says.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Incels are individuals who express frustration from perceived disadvantages to starting intimate relationships, that's really, really a lot of $3 words to explain, they can't get laid and they want to.

30
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Incel extremists idolize violent individuals like the Aurora Movie Theater shooter, that was the guy, he actually never said he was the Joker, a lot of people said, oh he dressed up like the Joker and went and shot up during that movie.

31
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He was just an orange-haired freak who shot up a movie theater, so he wasn't the Joker, I'm a Joker apologist, I've become a man who now has to defend the Joker.

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Then going back to this article, going back to this quote, they also idolize the Joker character, the violent clown from the Batman series, admiring his depiction as a man who must pretend to be happy but eventually fights back against his bullies.

33
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Why do I have to keep defending the Joker? The Joker is that characterization of the Joker, you guys are like, Jason this has nothing to do with this.

34
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 The characterization of the Joker has never been, ever, a man who must pretend to be happy while fighting back against his bullies.

35
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That may be what the new movie is about, but no, he's always been at the very least a common thug, a predator of the good people of Gotham, and in the most, a cosmic level diabolical creature.

36
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So whoever wrote this doesn't read comic books, so that's my first quiver with it.

37
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Let's let that aside, my Joker apologist stance aside, it's, I don't want to do the normal, it's sad that we live in a world where we have to do this, and it is sad, and it's not that it could be the military overreacting to which they have a tendency to do, military overreacts to everything.

38
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 It's not that. I am willing to throw out a conspiracy theory, and it's actually a conspiracy theory I've come up with a long time ago.

39
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Also let me say this, if you are an incel, if you consider yourself an incel, the words have power, and when you label yourself an incel, you really can't, it's hard to control what other people call you, but when you label yourself an incel, you're giving your body that tag, you're giving yourself that tag.

40
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You can have those feelings of frustration that you can't be in an intimate relationship with somebody, but the more power you give words, the more power we give words as a community, and especially the words you attach to yourself, they give them power.

41
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I don't attach negative words to myself, like I don't call myself fat, I will make jokes about me being chubby, and I'll make jokes about me being fat, but in my own private moments, I don't look in the mirror and go, I'm fat.

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I don't assign negative words to me outside of some sort of humor or something like that.

43
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And I will say I used to be fat, I'll use negative terminology of me in the past, but I don't use negative terminology for who you are.

44
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Sorry, that was a little preaching moment, let's get back to an actual interesting thing.

45
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 So this is a conspiracy theory I have, I have no proof of this, and it's most likely not true.

46
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 So, take it with a grain of salt. Who, this is what we look at when we look at conspiracy theories, especially ones that Jason made up.

47
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Who has the most to gain with people being afraid to go see Joker at the movie theater?

48
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And who has the ability to pull off something like this?

49
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And who owns the Magic Kingdom?

50
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Disney, Disney, the Disney company, got a bunch of people on the dark web and being like, the thing that is amazing about the internet is anyone can be anything.

51
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So you could have Bob Eiger sit down and be like, oh man, I wish I could have so much sex, I'm gonna go do all this violent stuff, and then it's just an anonymous thing on the web.

52
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So, Joker is poised for like a hundred million dollar opening weekend.

53
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Joker is being talked about, it's like one film festival, it's talked about being Oscar worthy.

54
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And that's the one thing Disney movies have never even come close to, not, I should say Disney Marvel movies.

55
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Joker, it is, and this is another reason why I'm looking forward to this movie, and I could be hyping it up too much, but Joker may possibly change the superhero genre.

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I will actually go so far to say that Joker may have the same effect on the superhero genre as Pulp Fiction had on independent film.

57
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Because I was talking to my lord, and this is one thing I like about DC, the movies are so weird, they're just so bizarre.

58
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 You have mustard, you have like a dance scene and then everyone gets killed by mustard gas and Wonder Woman, spoiler alert.

59
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Batman vs Superman was this bizarre meditation on everything, it was just crammed full of ideas.

60
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I just tell my little brother, we were talking about Face 4, because I'm really into movies, I'm really into movies and comic books and stuff like that.

61
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I never really talk about them on the show, because that's not why you guys listen to it, except for this segment.

62
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But I said, I told my little brother, you know what, I can tell you right, in regards to the Joker, it just looks so unique.

63
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 I can tell you right now what every movie in Marvel's Face 4 is going to look like.

64
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I can tell you exactly what the color palette is going to look like, I said it's going to look exactly like Iron Man.

65
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Iron Man 2 maybe, maybe they'll go a little bit darker.

66
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 But it's going to have that exact same color palette, because they all do.

67
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Guardians of the Galaxy was the only one that kind of changed up the color scheme, because they were in space.

68
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Then they come back in Avengers and it's that same set of paint brushes.

69
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I can tell you exactly what kind of Marvel 2 is going to look like, or Shang-Chi, Doctor Strange may be a little bit different.

70
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 But again, all the movies look the same.

71
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Marvel movies are the equivalent of a sports illustrated swimsuit issue, and DC movies are the equivalent of Suicide Girls.

72
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I don't even know if that website's still up, but just kind of a weird look to it.

73
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And everything looks grungy and all the photos look like it was taken at someone's backyard and/or murder dungeon.

74
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 So Marvel's pretty much gone with creativity.

75
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 They're all the movies that's a cookie cutter thing, and DC is still trying to figure stuff out, and they're just making these bizarre flicks.

76
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And I think that Joker could change-- Joker, when it comes out, it could make the Marvel movies look like antiques.

77
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Like, whoa, look at this really cool thing you can do with superheroes.

78
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Oh, great. Captain Marvel 2.

79
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Oh, yay. Another superhero I've never heard of.

80
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Wesley Snipes, not in Blade.

81
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And I think that Disney could actually be hurt by that.

82
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And so if they can make Joker not a hit, if they can make people scared to go see Joker, maybe they can hold on to their kingdom for a little bit longer.

83
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I have no proof of that whatsoever at all, so don't sue me, Disney.

84
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I don't have any proof of that at all.

85
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But it's an interesting, made-of-conspiracy nonetheless.

86
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So, okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

87
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That was an analysis, lawyers for Walt Disney Company.

88
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And I don't actually believe it.

89
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I just think it's interesting.

90
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 It's interesting theory.

91
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And this is a comedy podcast.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

93
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Now, our next story I came across, just kind of on accident, it sparked an old memory of mine.

94
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And it's funny because it's one of those stories-- we'll get to my Haunted Wendy story in a second, but--

95
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 it's one of those stories that I remember once when it happened to me.

96
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And I have a vague recollection.

97
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I mentioned this on the show before, and I asked on Twitter, @Dead RabbitRaters on my Twitter, you guys should sign up for that.

98
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I asked them. I said, "Have I done the Haunted Wendy story before?"

99
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And they were like, "No, I've never heard of that story."

100
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 So there is-- I believe them. I believe them.

101
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I still have an inkling somewhere back in the 300+ episodes I've mentioned it, but they're saying that they haven't heard it, so we'll go with it.

102
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So-- but it's one of those stories that when it happened to me, I actually didn't tell anybody.

103
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I didn't tell anybody for a long time, and then I finally told my sister, and then she told her boyfriend, and I ripped her a new one.

104
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And I said, "Listen, when I tell you a story, you don't tell anybody."

105
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Like that-- I tell the story.

106
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I'm kind of a dick to my sister, but I was like, "Listen, I tell the story."

107
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Like, I was telling you that story in confidence, and it's so bizarre and weird, you can't go around telling that story.

108
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Now here we fast forward 15 years later-- I love my sister to death, by the way, but I was not happy with that.

109
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 But I am a dick to her as well.

110
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 15 years now and later, I'm about to announce this story on public, so sorry, sis.

111
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But-- not really, she shouldn't have said it, but let's go ahead and get the preamble set up.

112
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I think this is a real interesting story. I found this story, and like I said, it sparked that memory.

113
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 This is from-- I was reading this Mysterious Universe article about people who travel to alternate dimensions, and there's about five different stories.

114
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Four of them I've read before, and I think three of them I've covered, one of them's coming up.

115
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But the Mysterious Universe article mentioned a Reddit post, and I was like, "This is interesting. There's no date, there's no name, there's no time, so it's really, really--

116
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 if it has about as much veracity as my Walt Disney conspiracy, it really isn't true, really, is the way I should say it, or most likely isn't true.

117
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But let's take a look at it briefly.

118
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 This dude, my sister-- this is my sister, 'cause this is something stupid my sister would do-- sorry, sis.

119
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 My sister's driving her car through town. She wants to go to McDonald's, right?

120
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Do-do-do-do-do. Dog in the back seat. Barking, walking around.

121
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And she's driving through town, and she starts to realize that the street lights are going to-- again, this is anonymous.

122
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 This is not actually my sister. Don't contact my sister.

123
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Tell me about the McDonald's. So, she's driving on the street, she sees the street lights going, "Won-won-won-won-won-won."

124
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Start flickering on and off. They weren't actually making those noises, and she's like, "That's weird."

125
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And then she hears like a loud buzzing-- there's like a loud feedback noise in her head, like a "eek!"

126
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And she feels pressure on her head. Something's going on, and the dog's freaking out in the back seat.

127
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Probably because it's no-- probably because it knows it's about to be fed in McDonald's, and the dog's like, "No, this isn't right."

128
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And so, the car-- she keeps driving the car, but the noise goes away, and the street lights are working fine.

129
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And then her car stalls, and then it starts to back up.

130
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So, you have this weird electrical interference, whatever, in-- as she's driving through the neighborhood.

131
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And she starts to realize that things in the neighborhood seem different.

132
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Not like each house is a big bubble, and there's like monsters walking around, it just seemed off.

133
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 She started seeing these cars drive by, and she didn't recognize the maker model of the car.

134
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And the car had like emblems on them that she didn't recognize, but the license plates were totally normal for the area.

135
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 So, she finds the McDonald's, and the McDonald's is in the exact same location that it always has been,

136
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 but it's in a different shaped building. And again, not a giant bubble with monsters.

137
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 It was just a different style building. And at this point-- so, you're driving on the road, this is all happening to you.

138
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 The feedback noise, the lights, that is a normal Tuesday for me.

139
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I wouldn't even register that. I'd be like, "Ugh, I wouldn't even register that as a bizarre thing."

140
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I don't know much about cars, so a Studebaker or an Astro-11 could fly by me,

141
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 and I'd have no idea that they-- what the maker model was.

142
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 The McDonald's different building probably still wouldn't pick up on that.

143
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But all of those things combined would start to make me feel a little iffy about the situation.

144
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But of course, I'm loving it. You gotta get that Mickey D's, right?

145
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Even though you may now be in an alternate universe, this character in this story, my sister, drives up to the McDonald's,

146
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 still willing to buy food even at this point, thinking they are no longer in their home dimension.

147
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 They ordered their food. Oh, and this is another great detail.

148
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Off this reddit post, they said, "I pulled up to the menu and the prices were more than they normally are."

149
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 That is stupid. That is the dumbest indicator of an alternate dimension I've ever seen.

150
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I went to Walmart the other day. Stuff was $3.99. I went there today. It was $4.99.

151
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 There's a little sales sticker laying on the ground that fell off.

152
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You're like, "The plot thickens." That is the dumbest detail.

153
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Anyways, still, my sister is dumb enough to order food from an alternate dimension, gets this McDonald's,

154
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 and when they go to pay for it, they go, "I want to pay with my credit card."

155
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And the person in the McDonald's worker person, who's not a monster, totally normal looking human,

156
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 gives her a device that looks like it's the sliger credit card, but instead it looks like your finger goes inside of it.

157
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's described as a blood pressure-looking machine.

158
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And so for the first time, this person does something smart.

159
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 They say, "I'm not going to use that. I'll pay with cash."

160
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So they pull cash out in the hands of the cashier, and the cashier kind of fumbles with the bills and looks at them for a moment,

161
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and then puts them in the drawer and pulls out a piece of paper, gives it back to my sister, and she goes,

162
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 "What's this?" And the cashier goes, "That's the word I'm looking for."

163
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And the cashier goes, "Oh, that is for..." This is a drive-through, by the way. I guess I should have mentioned that.

164
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 This is never got out of the car. That's a cash voucher.

165
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 We don't give out change. We give out cash voucher.

166
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So, "Oh, okay, we're..." And get the food.

167
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And then as she's driving out of the drive-through, she hears the noise again,

168
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 and she looks in a rearview mirror, and the McDonald's is back in the original building, and driving home, everything's back to normal.

169
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Now, an interesting story, yes. But let's take it apart a bit.

170
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 One, if the story's true, then you should still have the cash voucher. I'd like to see a photograph of that.

171
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Two, the idea that the makes and the models of the cars would be different would show a drastic change in the alternate dimension.

172
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 So, the layout of the street would be fine. The layout of the neighborhood would be fine.

173
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 But the fact that different companies had arisen to build different cars would show drastic changes in the timeline.

174
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It would be very, very unlikely in that case that the presidents on the money would be the same presidents.

175
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Because you could have a president Ford in that universe, and then Roosevelt made a car, or whatever,

176
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 or just some hobo became rich and made a car.

177
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Now, I'll push back a little bit on that pushback.

178
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It could be the cashier was so stupid or didn't care that when they looked at the bills and there were different people on there,

179
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 they're just like whatever. But I'd like to see the cash voucher.

180
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's most likely just a fun story that somebody wrote online.

181
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Let's talk about the haunted windows.

182
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 When I lived in Sacramento, I lived all over Sacramento, but I lived one time off Howe Avenue,

183
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 and it's the street that goes right down into Sac State.

184
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So, I was right on the corner of Howe and the street that goes to Sac State.

185
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And there was a boarders books there. There used to be a blockbuster on the corner.

186
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 There's a little Safeway shopping center, things like that.

187
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And then there is a, like, it was basically a strip mall and stuff like that.

188
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I used to go there to GameStop. That's where I bought Resident Evil 4, one of my favorite games of all time.

189
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And I used to go to the blockbuster all the time. I rented so many movies from blockbusters.

190
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They gave me a gold card because I rented like a thousand movies in a year or something like that.

191
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Like, they were basically applauding me as they gave me this special card.

192
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So, along that strip, there's a Wendy's, a Wendy's restaurant.

193
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And there were so many food choices in the area.

194
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And Wendy's is one of those things. You kind of got to be in the mood for a square burger.

195
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You kind of got to be, really, you go to Wendy's for the Frosty.

196
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Like, the burgers are pretty good. They're very fresh.

197
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 French fries are decent. They're not as good as McDonald's French fries.

198
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But better than Burger King French fries.

199
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 But the burgers are pretty good. And they got Frosty's.

200
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You got little milkshake things. You got Abe with the spoon.

201
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But there were so many food choices there that, you know, I wouldn't go there very often.

202
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 But I remember one day I go, I'm going to go to Wendy's.

203
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I'm going to drive to Wendy's, go through Drive-Thru.

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Now, there was no crazy blinkin' lights, nothing like that.

205
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It was normal drive. I lived a couple blocks from it.

206
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I drove down the road, got into the Drive-Thru.

207
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And so, I've got some weird stuff happening to me in Drive-Thru.

208
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I'm sitting behind a car in the Drive-Thru.

209
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 The story's 100% true. At least I saw it.

210
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Could have been a hallucination.

211
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Could have been a whole host of things.

212
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But let me go ahead and tell you what happened.

213
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So, and this would have probably been, probably like 2005.

214
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I'm sitting there in my car and I'm behind another car that's getting their food.

215
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And I'm just not really paying attention to stuff.

216
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Listening to music, waiting for my delicious Frosty and then the food I ordered

217
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 to excuse me getting a Frosty.

218
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 So, you have the Drive-Thru window. And there's the car in front of me.

219
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And I see the person in the car give the cashier the money.

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So, it reaches out and gives the money to the cashier in the window.

221
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And then, this is going to be really, really hard for me to explain.

222
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 What I see come out of the Drive-Thru window.

223
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 I'll tell you exactly what I saw and then I'm going to tell you...

224
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Oh, okay.

225
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 There's a giant ball of paper cups.

226
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So, like, empty Wendy's cups.

227
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 There's a giant ball of empty Wendy cups and napkins, like,

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 pushed together to make, like, a giant ball.

229
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Like, if someone said, "Hey, pick up all that garbage."

230
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And you just scooped up a bunch of paper cups and napkins.

231
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And then you held it. That's what it looked like.

232
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But it was probably about, I don't know, maybe a foot?

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Maybe... I'm trying to make the size of it with my hands here.

234
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Maybe, like, a foot or two of material.

235
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And so, this ball comes out of the cashier's...

236
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 out of the Drive-Thru window, right?

237
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And attached to it is a...

238
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Now, this is probably, like, a good four feet long tube made...

239
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it's not like a cardboard tube.

240
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 It is made of coffee stirrers.

241
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 There's little...

242
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 There's little... I don't know if they still make them,

243
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 but they have little pieces of wood that used to stir your coffee.

244
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And straws. And more tissue paper.

245
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Like, more napkins.

246
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So imagine if someone made a giant lollipop out of garbage,

247
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 out of stuff that you could find in a Wendy's.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Coffee stirrer, straws, napkins, and cups.

249
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Had this giant ball on the top.

250
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And then had this about four foot long tube coming out of the back of it.

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And it had this arch to it, right?

252
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And I watched this, and I'm, like, looking at it.

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And I watched this thing come out of the Wendy's.

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And it has, like I said, it has an arch to it.

255
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So it almost looked like someone was holding the bottom of it.

256
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And they were making, they were basically, like, pushing it out of the window.

257
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And I'm watching this, and I'm, like,

258
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 "What is going on? Like, who built this thing?"

259
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And you go, "Jason, it was some kid, bored at Wendy's, who made this thing."

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And that's exactly what I would have thought.

261
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But we haven't even gotten started with this crazy, crazy event.

262
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The people sitting in the car waiting for their food.

263
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 This giant prop comes out of the Wendy's you have through the window, right?

264
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And it's holding or balancing the food.

265
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So you have this giant ball made of this stuff.

266
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And kind of hanging underneath it is a bag of food, right?

267
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 So it's like someone made this giant prop, and they attach bags of food to it,

268
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and they stick it through the window.

269
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Instead of just being a normal human,

270
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 and reaching through the window, handed it to someone,

271
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 they reach through the window, and they hand the bag to the people in the car.

272
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And the car drives away.

273
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And I pull up, and I look in the -- I'm terrified at this point,

274
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 because so -- and that's -- let me -- okay, let me keep telling the story.

275
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I feel terrified at this point, because I have no idea what I just saw.

276
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I mean, I know what it was. It was much a garbage with, like, a bag attached to it.

277
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But there was some key details that I'm leaving out right now,

278
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 because I really got to go into detail with those.

279
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I'm watching this thing come out. I pull up. I'm a little terrified.

280
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And I turn and I ask the girl -- there's a young girl at the cashier window --

281
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I go, "What was that?"

282
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And she looks at me and she goes, "Oh, he always likes to play tricks."

283
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Hands me my bag of food, and I drive away.

284
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And I'm thinking in my head, some guy made this giant thing,

285
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 and he attached the food to it and handed it to her.

286
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But then, as I'm driving away, my mind is basically saying

287
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 that was a bunch of garbage put together, and some kid was using it.

288
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 But then this other part of my head was going, "Jason, what you just saw was physically impossible,

289
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and here's why. One, the way it arched out of the window,

290
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 it would have clipped the top of the roof of the -- like, you know, you have those windows,

291
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and they're not super big of the drive-thru.

292
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 The way that it was -- it came out like a perfect arch,

293
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 but there is no physical way it could have fit through there the way it was arching up.

294
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Two, there is no way that coffee stirrers and napkins could hold a bag of food,

295
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 or even just the prop at the end of it.

296
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And the way that it came down and bounced down, when I remember it,

297
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 the big ball also should have clipped -- should have hit the roof of the car.

298
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 It should have had such a long arch, it shouldn't have been able to get out,

299
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and it should have hit the top of the car.

300
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It shouldn't have been able to support its own weight, and it wasn't there when I pulled up.

301
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 It was completely gone.

302
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And that's when I realize something, or think I realize something.

303
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Because this has happened to me before.

304
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 There have been times where I've seen a ghost or a haunting,

305
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 and your brain immediately starts to try to rationalize it.

306
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 So you'll look down a hallway, and it'll be completely empty, but you feel a little, ugh.

307
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And then a week later, you're sitting in your living room, you're reading a book,

308
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and you remember you saw a little kid standing at the end of that hallway looking at you.

309
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Because you see it, and your brain immediately starts basically retconning itself.

310
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 No, that wasn't there. It was just an empty hallway, it was a breeze.

311
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And then later on, the memory comes back of why you actually had that reaction.

312
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 It wasn't a thing of paper and napkins and a big ball.

313
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 This is, again, this is going to sound super weird.

314
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 What came out of that, Wendy's?

315
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It was a giant eyeball.

316
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 A giant eyeball with, like, a tendril attached to it.

317
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Now can I prove it? No.

318
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Is it possibly that that is my own imagination retcon? Absolutely.

319
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 But I remember it...

320
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 When I remember that event, I remember two things.

321
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I remember the actual physical scene of the paper and the cups.

322
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I mean, you would need some heavy wood to balance all that stuff.

323
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I mean, I hope I'm trying to set a...

324
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I hope I'm getting across how fragile this thing would actually be to build,

325
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and then you're delivering food with it.

326
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 But when I remember it, I remember it as the paper cups and the tube and all that stuff.

327
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And then I also remember it as a long green tendril and a giant eye type thing on the end of it.

328
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And it kind of moving through the building and then clipping into the car

329
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and dropping the food off and then going back in.

330
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 One memory is 100% real, which is the paper cup thing.

331
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And the other memory is, maybe not a memory at all, a sense.

332
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 That's what I saw.

333
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I stopped going to that Wendy's. I didn't go to it that often, but I stopped going there.

334
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 But every show, often, my little brother would come into town

335
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 or I'd have a visitor over and they'd be like, "Hey, you want to go get some Wendy's?"

336
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And I'd be like...

337
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Because I wasn't telling people this story. I'd be like, "Sure. Let's go to the Wendy's."

338
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 So we'd go to the Wendy's and go through drive-thru and nothing too unusual.

339
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 We'd go during the day, but nothing too unusual.

340
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 The last time I went to that Wendy's, it had been maybe a year since that had happened.

341
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I wanted a Frosty.

342
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So I thought, "I'm going to go back to that Wendy's."

343
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I never forgot that story. I'm going to go back to that Wendy's.

344
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 So I parked my car, I walked inside, and I ordered my food.

345
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And the person behind the counter was a teenager.

346
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Just like, "Yeah, sure. Here's dude, dude, dude. Yes, your food."

347
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And I went and I sat down because I'm tempting fate at this point.

348
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 The teenager didn't set off any alarm bells when I'm sitting down and I'm eating my food.

349
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

350
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Eating some Frosty. Nom, nom, nom. Eating food.

351
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And then for whatever reason, I look up and I look around.

352
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And I realize that it's probably the middle of the day.

353
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 It's probably around noon or one that I'm there.

354
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 It is, other than myself and the employees, completely empty.

355
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Now, I did say there were a lot of food choices in the area.

356
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But when's the last time you walked into a fast food restaurant in the middle of the day

357
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and it had nobody in it except you and the employees?

358
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Not impossible, but a little hard.

359
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I'm sitting there and I look up and it's completely empty.

360
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And there's maybe four visible employees and all of them are just kind of moving,

361
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 almost like they're on a track.

362
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Like one guy was just kind of moving around in the back.

363
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 I could see one guy moving around in the kitchen and then there was a girl kind of moving around the dining room area,

364
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 not cleaning up, just kind of walking around.

365
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 They looked zombified.

366
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Maybe there were only three and now they think about it.

367
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Maybe there was another one in the back, but I remember kind of stopped eating

368
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 because I realized I was the only one in there.

369
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I don't remember if there was music playing.

370
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I think actually there was no music playing.

371
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It was dead quiet.

372
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And that could be an exaggeration, to be honest.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 That could just be a detail I've remembered to make the story more spooky.

374
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I got to admit it when I'm not 100%.

375
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And I remember looking up and everyone was just kind of moving in a very odd fashion, blank look on their face.

376
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I remember that and I just kind of looked around at everybody and they were not acknowledging me,

377
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 which is that's usually customer service at a fast food restaurant,

378
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 but they weren't acknowledging me.

379
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 They weren't chatting with each other.

380
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 They weren't really doing anything.

381
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 They were almost like moving about, waiting for stimulus,

382
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 waiting for someone to come and order food.

383
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And I remember going this, there's something not right about this place.

384
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I already saw the tendril or the giant ball of cups, either way, both are bizarre.

385
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And I didn't come here for a while unless I was with a friend and now I'm sitting here

386
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 and it's again, there's something off about this place.

387
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I took what was left to my food, got in my car, drove away.

388
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Maybe two, three months later, the Wendy's closed, closed down.

389
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And I thought, when's the last time I've ever seen a fast food restaurant close?

390
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 It happens. Again, that's not impossible.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And the fact that they didn't have any business on 1pm, middle of the week,

392
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 means you're probably not making a ton of money.

393
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 But I didn't think it was, first off, it's weird that a Wendy,

394
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 because Arby's was killing it.

395
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Arby's was maybe four businesses away and Arby's is garbage food and they were killing it.

396
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I forced myself to try to eat Arby's multiple times.

397
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It's gross. Wendy's is way better than that and it's only like four buildings away.

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So, sorry Arby's.

399
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But Wendy's shut down, which is weird.

400
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 A fast food restaurant shutting down is weird, but again, not impossible.

401
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And to make it even weirder, and again, now maybe stretching the definition of weird,

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 that fast food restaurant stayed empty for years.

403
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 It actually was still empty when I left Sacramento.

404
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 So probably about, or at least that area, so probably about four years,

405
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 that building on that prime piece of real estate,

406
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 that is maybe half a mile from Sac State, right on the border of downtown,

407
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 tons of businesses in the area.

408
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 A fast food restaurant with a giant parking lot stood empty for years.

409
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 I don't know what was up with that Wendy's.

410
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 I have no idea.

411
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 High school kid pulling a prank and able to break the laws of physics.

412
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 I mean, that's more likely than an interdimensional entity taking over a fast food restaurant,

413
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 sucking the souls out of its employees,

414
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 turning them into mere husks of humans that simply walk around and empty Wendy's

415
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 waiting for a customer to come in.

416
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 But, but, something, I don't know what was going on there, but something was.

417
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And whatever was going on there was so toxic that a prime piece of real estate went empty for years.

418
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Could you imagine being a realtor and you happen to get, you're like,

419
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 "All right, I got the Wendy's gig.

420
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 I can actually sell this building to someone else.

421
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It has a full kitchen built in, giant parking.

422
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 It had one of the biggest parking lots in that strip.

423
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Massive parking lot.

424
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 It has drive-through built in.

425
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 This is great.

426
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 I can't wait to sell this.

427
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I'll make so much money.

428
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Yes, that's our real estate agents to talk as far as I know.

429
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I actually know a couple of them, but, and you walk into this Wendy's,

430
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 you got your keys jingling them and you open the door.

431
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 There's like cobwebs everywhere, a black cat.

432
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 But after you shoo away the black cat with the broom and clean up the cobwebs,

433
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 you're walking around this empty Wendy's and you're like,

434
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 "This is going to be easy to sell.

435
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Perfect real estate has all the stuff built into it."

436
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 But you get a weird feeling.

437
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 You don't know exactly what it is, but you feel like you're not alone.

438
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 A couple of weeks later, you put your sign out, hammered it into the cement.

439
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Honey and vinegar real estate, right?

440
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 You're a subsidiary of that great chain of Philadelphia.

441
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 You're trying to tell a scary story, but I keep cracking jokes.

442
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 You're the real estate agent.

443
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 You're inviting these customers into your Wendy's.

444
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And so you bring these two customers in and you're like,

445
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 "I've totally gone off rails with this, but I got it ended somehow."

446
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 You walk, this is supposed to be scary.

447
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 You walk people into the Wendy's and you're like,

448
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 "Look at this.

449
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Don't you want this?

450
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Isn't this a great location for you?"

451
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 And the people are like, "Yes, yes.

452
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 We would love to buy this property or rent it or whatever you do when you get real estate."

453
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 We love to do this.

454
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And then in the corner of the darkened room,

455
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 I have to make this scary again.

456
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 In the corner of the darkened room, the two people see something move in the darkness.

457
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 They don't know what it is.

458
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 It looks like garbage falling out into the corner of the room.

459
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And when the two people look in the corner of the room,

460
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 they turn to the real estate agent and they go, "What was that?"

461
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And the real estate agent looks at him with a blank look on their face and says,

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 "Oh, nothing.

463
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 He's just playing games."

464
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 That's kind of scary, right?

465
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 That's kind of scary.

466
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
