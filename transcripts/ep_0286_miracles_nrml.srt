1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 Today is Miracle Day, as we cover three stories about miracles.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,480
 Now, am I stretching the definition of the word "miracle" to include these three stories?

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,680
 Sure, but they are miracles nonetheless.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,720
 And get your hanky ready for the third story.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,160
 It's an emotional ride of survivors, friendship, and one of the biggest tragedies in American

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
 history today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:34,280
 [Music]

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,880
 I have hit a new low though.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,840
 I'm not playing Minecraft all the time.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
 I am now watching YouTube videos of people playing Minecraft.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
 Not PewDiePie.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,880
 PewDiePie videos are pretty entertaining.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,440
 I do watch those, but I'm watching videos on how to build a villager spawner and how

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,560
 to get the most XP by melting bamboo.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,720
 I'm embarrassed myself that I have now sunk that low, but I'm not playing Minecraft anymore.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 Baby steps.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
 Baby steps.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 Baby steps.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 I got some new Patreons.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,920
 We got, and you know what, so I didn't think about this.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
 I have such a hard time pronouncing things and I'm like, "Oh, people have names that

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
 I can't pronounce."

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 We have James Milne.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
 Milne?

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,920
 James Milne.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,080
 Thank you so much for your Patreon edge.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,920
 Guess would be the term.

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,800
 We have Mason Nordbeck.

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,200
 Mason Nordbeck has been listening to the show for a long time.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,440
 He's been emailing me a lot.

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,360
 I think we've covered a couple of the stories he's recommended as well.

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
 He's a young guy, college student.

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,520
 I like interacting with you guys, learning about you dudes.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,040
 And then we have Bennett Grappone.

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,000
 Again, I'm so sorry if that's not how you pronounce your name.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Bennett Grappone.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 He's our Bigfoot guy.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,440
 He denies it, but nearly 90% of the recommendations he sent me involved Bigfoot.

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,160
 He's the guy responsible for Bigfoot Week quite a while back.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,000
 So thank you guys so much for supporting the show.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
 I really, really appreciated it.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,920
 It's doing a lot better than honestly I thought it would.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,440
 So thank you so much.

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,520
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,280
 Now, miracles.

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,320
 How do they work?

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,480
 What are miracles?

52
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 They happen every day.

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,200
 I don't know the insane clown posse song enough to make more of a joke than that, but miracles

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,040
 surround us.

55
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,760
 Sometimes they're little miracles.

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
 Sometimes they're big miracles.

57
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,880
 Let's go ahead and take a look at some of these miracles.

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,240
 I wave my hand and a bunch of confetti, magical dust appears, and we are transported to the

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,560
 magical land known as the Bronx.

60
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,120
 The Bronx in New York.

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
 I'm wearing all white.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,280
 I'm dressed in like a colt leader robe.

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
 You're like Jason, this show's really going to your head.

64
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,480
 I'm like, and now you can talk because you upset the master.

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,240
 You're like your mouth disappears.

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,480
 We're standing in the Bronx.

67
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
 We're in New York City.

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
 This is very recently.

69
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,040
 We see a 63 year old man hobbling down the street.

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,880
 I'm like, dude, watch this.

71
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 Watch this.

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,800
 This is going to be hilarious.

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 You can't protest.

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
 Your mouth is gone.

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,720
 The guy is walking on the street and he falls on his butt.

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 He's like, oh, my butt.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,000
 But oddly enough, he didn't hurt his butt.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 He hurt his knee.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,480
 He's like, ah, he holds his butt for a second.

80
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,440
 He's like, no, my knee, my knee.

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
 I look at you and you look at me.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We go, we pick him up.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'm fine.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,280
 I'm laughing because I think it's funny.

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
 But you give me a stern look, pick up the old man.

86
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
 But then you have to pick me up because my foot still hurts and you carry me and him

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
 to the hospital.

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,080
 Now, when he gets to the hospital, doctors sitting there, it's like, ah, great.

89
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,560
 Being a doctor is so boring.

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,360
 Why can't I do brain surgery and stuff?

91
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,560
 And they're like, dude, because you're a general, what is it?

92
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
 General doctor guy.

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,160
 He's not like a specialized doctor.

94
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
 He's super boring.

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
 He's like, I can't people.

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
 Why can't this be like house?

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,400
 I wish people had bizarre diseases spinning his pencil in his hand playing Charlie Charlie.

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,600
 But anyway, so Charlie Charlie is not answering him and he goes, oh, look at this old man

99
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,140
 is being carried in by this young man who's being carried by another man and you drop us

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,140
 all off.

101
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,800
 And the old man's like, oh, my knee and my butt kind of hurts, but it's mostly my knee,

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,520
 mostly my knee, my old man, my joints, my joints hurt.

103
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,760
 But the doctor's like, you know, go step on the x-ray machine, go do that, sit down, whatever.

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,040
 Doesn't even care, gives them the wrong instructions.

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,880
 He's like, I'm just going to inject you with something.

106
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
 It's going to make you x-ray.

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
 You guys, I don't think that's how it works.

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
 Doctors like, I don't care.

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
 I'm bored, man.

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 I'm bored.

111
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,680
 But they do the x-rays and the doctors look into the x-rays and he goes, oh, my God, this

112
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,120
 is a medical miracle.

113
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,080
 This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

114
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,680
 Because what appears on the x-ray is the guy's junk.

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
 His penis is on the x-ray.

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,960
 And the doctor goes, my God, this is a medical miracle.

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,800
 There are only 40 cases in world history of something called penile ossification, aka your

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,560
 junk, your genitalia is turning into bone.

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,520
 So it's all like the skin is getting replaced by little fragments of bone.

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,680
 And the doctor's super excited.

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,640
 Finally his job is exciting.

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,600
 It'd be the equivalent of one of us finding a lottery ticket for a doctor nerd.

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,120
 Because this is so rare.

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,200
 He's super excited.

125
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
 He pulls the x-ray off.

126
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
 He's running through the hospital like Charlie with a golden ticket through the hospital.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 Going, I got it, I got it.

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,480
 Everyone's like, run, Charlie, run.

129
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:34,440
 He runs into his little doctor office where the old man was, knowing that he was going

130
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,760
 to write papers on this guy.

131
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 This is going to be amazing.

132
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,360
 This is going to be a miracle that he found this guy.

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,880
 He goes in the office, the dude's gone, the guy bounced.

134
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,160
 They can't find him.

135
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 He's disappeared.

136
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,760
 Ooh, mysterious.

137
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,800
 Now most likely he just walked out the door.

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,280
 I don't think the people from Boner Planet like re-obducted him.

139
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,600
 They're like, you shouldn't be down there.

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
 You'll give away our alien species.

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
 But he just walked out the door.

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
 They can't find him now.

143
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
 He's gone.

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,400
 I mean, okay, here's the, I don't know how fast this guy was walking.

145
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,200
 He does have a bum knee and he has a bone penis.

146
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,560
 I don't know how comfortable that is, but it's a miracle nonetheless.

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
 A medical miracle and a miracle for the doctor because he didn't end up writing the paper

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,480
 and that's why we know about this.

149
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,240
 It was fairly recent the paper came out, but now that man with that bone penis is somewhere

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,480
 out there in New York and you'll know it because you'll hear like a creaky knee sneaking

151
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
 up behind you.

152
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
 I don't know why he's sneaking up on people.

153
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,960
 He's just going to the grocery store.

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
 He's not trying to hurt people, but, and I was reading the story and I was like, oh,

155
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
 dude, this is hilarious.

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,400
 And, and he always has like a, it's always hard, right?

157
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
 But then it turns out that this actually causes erectile dysfunction, which makes sense because

158
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
 like there's no blood flow in it.

159
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,680
 It's all bone, but you figure, you know, miracle, a miracle for the doctor at least, probably

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,800
 a little inconvenient for the guy.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 Now you're going Jason.

162
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
 Yeah, is that really your definition of a miracle?

163
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
 Is that really make your mouth appear again so you can protest?

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,040
 Then I go, listen, yeah, kind of.

165
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,280
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next miracle.

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,160
 We are going to the beautiful country known as Turkey.

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,920
 That's so, yeah, that was a different country.

168
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,160
 I just follow my notes of anyway, I'm sure Turkey's lovely.

169
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,400
 Sometimes we're going to the lovely country of Turkey and the year is 2009.

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,160
 And we're standing outside a beautiful penthouse.

171
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
 I'm in my white robes.

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,440
 I'm going to give you white robes too.

173
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
 Now you have white robes too.

174
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,680
 We're standing outside this beautiful villa, not penthouse penthouses on top of buildings.

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,280
 This is a villa because it's just a building, like a little building like a two-story building,

176
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
 right?

177
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
 Penthouse is always on top.

178
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,600
 And just have a penthouse in the middle of the desert and no building attached to it.

179
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 I'm pretty sure.

180
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,000
 So anyways, it's a villa.

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,840
 We're standing in front of this beautiful villa and we see these armored vehicles.

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,320
 Going up like this dirt road.

183
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 I don't know.

184
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
 It could have been paved.

185
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
 I don't know.

186
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,600
 Anyways, kicking up dust.

187
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
 Rabbits are jumping out of the way.

188
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
 Tumbleweed rolling across.

189
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
 I'm sure it was paved.

190
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
 I'm sure it was paved.

191
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,880
 I don't think anyone builds a villa in the middle of nowhere and doesn't include the

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 roads.

193
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,160
 Roads are extra.

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
 So anyways, these military vehicles are driving through the desert.

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,800
 There's guys like hanging off the side of the vehicles.

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
 They jump off the car.

197
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,200
 They're like, "Go, go, go!"

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
 Going with her weapons.

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
 "Clear!

200
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
 Clear!"

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 Kicking down the door.

202
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 "Get on the ground!

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
 Get on the ground!"

204
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
 "Ah!"

205
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
 "Ah!"

206
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,040
 There are all these women screaming inside.

207
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,280
 There's a bunch of like dudes.

208
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
 These regular dudes.

209
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 Business suits.

210
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
 They're like, "No, no, don't hurt us!"

211
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
 And he's like, "Get on the ground!

212
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,760
 Get on the ground now!"

213
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,000
 Everyone gets on the ground and armored the cops, the armored police or whatever.

214
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
 The military police is actually, the armored police at Starship Troopers Office.

215
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,400
 The military police have taken control of this villa and we're thinking, "Whoa, is this

216
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,120
 like some sort of drug raid?

217
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
 What's going on?"

218
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,080
 You figure the drug dealer could afford roads, but it's a weird world.

219
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,880
 So what it turns out was going on in this house was these guys got this idea and they

220
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,000
 said, "You know what?

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,720
 Let's do a reality show."

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,400
 But let's not broadcast it.

223
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,720
 Let's tell women we're going to do a reality show and we'll get these super hot Instagram

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,400
 models to come out here.

225
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,040
 And we're going to put cameras everywhere and we'll say, "Hey, today why don't you fight

226
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,920
 with Tracy and like fight over your hair or something like that?"

227
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
 And the girls are like, "Yeah, sure.

228
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 How many people are watching this show?"

229
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
 And they're like, "Oh, the ratings are through the roof.

230
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
 Ratings are sky high."

231
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
 But they weren't broadcasting it.

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,840
 They just wanted a bunch of sexy women to watch around in the house in bikinis as these

233
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,360
 guys just watched them.

234
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,040
 And you go, "Well, they had cameras everywhere."

235
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,160
 They did because you could watch it on their dark web internet.

236
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,040
 I don't know if it's necessarily dark web, but there was this website that you could

237
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,280
 just watch the girls walk around in bikinis.

238
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,320
 It was not a reality show at all.

239
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,760
 And what happened was, so the girls show up, right?

240
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,200
 They're hanging out and they start to realize, "Hey, there's no camera crews here.

241
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,320
 We've been here for weeks.

242
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,240
 We have no idea what's going on.

243
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 What's the deal?"

244
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
 And the guys are like, "Listen, here's the thing.

245
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,600
 People can watch you online.

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
 They pay a subscription and they can watch the different cameras.

247
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
 They watch you walk around in your sexy bikinis.

248
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,680
 You are famous, but you're only famous among perverts with an internet connection."

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,120
 So a lot of the women were like, "Well, we want to leave.

250
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
 This isn't what we signed up for."

251
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 And this is the problem.

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
 The guys go, "Well, you can't.

253
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
 You signed a contract.

254
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,360
 You got to walk around this house in a bikini based on your contract."

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,920
 So of course, one of the rules were no cell phones and no outside contact, which is really

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
 standard with reality shows.

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 So they're kind of stuck there.

258
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,560
 And they were being told to fight each other.

259
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,520
 They're like, "Because they wanted it to be dramatic."

260
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
 It was weird.

261
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,360
 It wasn't a reality show, but they wanted them to act like it was on a reality show.

262
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,240
 One of them didn't have like a trident and a net and the other one had like a sword and

263
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 a shield.

264
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
 They just like push each other into the pool.

265
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,360
 "Beccy, you stole my makeup."

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 Type of stuff.

267
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
 "Splash."

268
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,880
 Jump out all wet and sexy.

269
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:35,040
 So one of them does get access to the outside world and calls up her family and says, "We're

270
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
 being trapped here.

271
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
 They're forcing us."

272
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,080
 Another thing that they made them do was they would occasionally have pool dance parties

273
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,480
 where the girls would just have to stand by the side of the pool and dance.

274
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,200
 Now the women were never recorded in the bathroom and they only had to wear bikinis.

275
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,960
 So they weren't being told to like strip or anything like that.

276
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
 Even by their accounts, they were never sexually harassed.

277
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
 They were just held prisoner.

278
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,440
 They would have to like dance by the side of the pool and there would just be like a

279
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,080
 little webcam on the like the corner and they're like, "Can I stop dancing now?"

280
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,400
 And he's like, "No, this is our highest ratings yet."

281
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,480
 Anyways, one of them does contact the outside world, gets a hold of her family and she's

282
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,120
 like, "We're being held prisoner in the middle of nowhere."

283
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,680
 So the family calls the military police and the military police come out and raid the

284
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,640
 compound and the girls say we were lied to.

285
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,000
 We were told it was going to be a reality show like Big Brother, but it was just a bunch

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
 of perverts watching it online.

287
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
 The guys in charge said, "No, no, no, no.

288
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,400
 We told them full well what they were in for.

289
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,920
 They're just bored.

290
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,400
 So they wanted to leave."

291
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,680
 The military police were like scratching their heads, their collective heads, they're scratching

292
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
 their helmets and they go, "Okay, well that's all well and good and we understand that you

293
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,560
 have these contracts and you have them dancing by the pool and the bikinis and the guys

294
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,320
 are like, "Yeah, yeah, that's all fine."

295
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,600
 And the military police goes, "But I'm pretty sure that girl is only 15 years old."

296
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
 And the guys are like, "Gulp."

297
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,520
 So one of them was underage and that wasn't good either.

298
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,480
 So they all get arrested, but there's no, I couldn't find, that all happened in 2009.

299
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
 There's no follow-up.

300
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,280
 So I don't know if they were actually ever pun- the girls' war eventually released.

301
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,200
 They're not still there dancing by the side of the pool.

302
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,680
 Their hell never ends.

303
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
 But there was no follow-up.

304
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,680
 This happened and then nothing.

305
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,320
 So most likely they, everyone just got sent home.

306
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,600
 Most likely there were no charges brought or anything like that.

307
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,080
 And that is a miracle.

308
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:33,560
 That's a miracle because that could have easily ended up as some sort of torture, porn, horrible

309
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,920
 death for these people.

310
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,280
 "Hey everyone, come out into the middle of nowhere.

311
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,600
 Bring your own road.

312
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 BYOR.

313
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,720
 You're going to be here on camera and we're going to murder you."

314
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,160
 People are like, "Can you repeat that last part again?"

315
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 And they're like, "Oh no, no, no, just fine print.

316
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,520
 It's just fine talk.

317
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,520
 It's stuff we say really, really quietly and then we murder you."

318
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,280
 So it's a miracle, right?

319
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 It is a miracle that these women didn't die.

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,000
 And for the men, it's a miracle that they didn't spend the rest of their lives in a

321
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Turkish prison.

322
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,880
 So everything worked out, right?

323
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
 Miracle.

324
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
 True miracle.

325
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,800
 Now at this point, the dust is swirling around us as I'm casting another spell to take us

326
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
 to our new location.

327
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:21,200
 And you're like, "Jason, this episode might be the weakest connection.

328
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 Stories are interesting, right?"

329
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,360
 You're like, "Yeah, fairly interesting."

330
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
 But I don't think there are miracles.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,280
 But see, sometimes when you make a cake, you got to put some sugar and milk in it, right?

332
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
 To make it taste good.

333
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,000
 Because otherwise, it's just bread in an oven.

334
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,160
 I just came up with that analogy.

335
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,560
 You don't know if it makes sense, but sometimes you have to have a little humor, a little

336
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
 fun in the cake.

337
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,440
 The humor in the fun is the milk.

338
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
 You guys get it, okay?

339
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,240
 The point is that our next story is truly a story of miracles, but it's going to take

340
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
 us to a dark place.

341
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,400
 We are going into the South Tower on September 11th, 2001.

342
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
 It's 9/11.

343
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,840
 And the North Tower has just been hit by a plane.

344
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,240
 The people in the South Tower thought, "This must be some sort of horrible accident.

345
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,040
 There is no way that someone could do something like this."

346
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,040
 And that's pretty much what everyone thought that morning.

347
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,400
 It was an accident.

348
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,880
 And people were being told, "Just stay here.

349
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,120
 Rescue vehicles are going to swarm the area.

350
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,720
 You're better off in the South Tower.

351
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,960
 Down there, you're going to be getting in the way of all the rescue personnel."

352
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,760
 So then announcement goes out.

353
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
 Now, we have Brian Clark.

354
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,800
 He's in the South Tower.

355
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
 And one of his coworkers is completely flipping out.

356
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,560
 Like everyone's flipping out, but one of them is just really, really distraught.

357
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,240
 And Brian, Brian Clark, throws his arm over their shoulder and says, "Let's go for a walk."

358
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,880
 And they start walking to the opposite side of the South Tower.

359
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
 Let's calm down.

360
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
 You don't have to see that.

361
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
 Like it's horrible.

362
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,640
 Let's come over here.

363
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,800
 We're still in the South Tower.

364
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,720
 We have Stanley Prime Kneth.

365
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
 Stanley Prime Kneth.

366
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,720
 In Stanley, his office is on the 81st floor of the South Tower.

367
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,160
 Stanley's sitting there at his window.

368
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,920
 And he already knows that horrible destruction that's happened next door.

369
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
 But a lot of people just kind of went back to work.

370
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,840
 What are you going to do?

371
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,160
 You're safe.

372
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 And he's sitting there.

373
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,480
 And he's just kind of filing paperwork around, really not doing anything.

374
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
 Just trying to keep busy.

375
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
 Try to keep calm.

376
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,240
 And he looks out the window and he sees a plane come around the Statue of Liberty.

377
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
 And he's watching it.

378
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 It's getting closer and closer.

379
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,160
 It gets so big and so easy for him to see.

380
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,760
 He actually can see the letter U for United Airlines on the side of the plane.

381
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,440
 He watches it bank right.

382
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,960
 Like it wasn't headed directly towards him, but it's flying low and close.

383
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,400
 And then it turns right and starts heading right towards him.

384
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,880
 He says, "Lord, I can't do this.

385
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,000
 You take over."

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
 And just huddles.

387
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:10,240
 The plane impacts 130 feet from his desk and everything goes black except for the flames

388
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,320
 that ignite through the building.

389
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,680
 And he just begins screaming for help.

390
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,960
 Brian's on the opposite side of the South Tower on his floor.

391
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,400
 And when that plane hits, everyone in his office is killed.

392
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,760
 Where he was sitting was where the plane impacted.

393
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,440
 Blackness and flames surround everything.

394
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
 And it's a mad dash at this point.

395
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
 He opens up the stairwell.

396
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 It's pitch black.

397
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,560
 Now, he's been up and down that stairwell numerous times, but it is...

398
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,640
 There's no light whatsoever.

399
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,880
 Now you don't even see the flames.

400
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,120
 And as he's walking down this pitch black staircase to wherever, the ground, you don't

401
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,600
 really know where you're going.

402
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,880
 You just know you can't be here.

403
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,560
 He hears someone screaming.

404
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,480
 He hears multiple screaming, but above it all, he hears a man screaming.

405
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,800
 And that's when he sees Stanley.

406
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,440
 There is a flashlight that Brian gets.

407
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,800
 And I don't know if he got it from a desk or if there was like a service thing there,

408
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,720
 like an emergency service thing, but he's able to get a flashlight.

409
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,000
 And he starts looking around the room and he sees Stanley separated from freedom.

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
 I mean, they're still trapped in a burning building, but Stanley is actually blocked

411
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,120
 by a mangled wall, like a wall that's completely collapsed.

412
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,600
 And Stanley's on the other side of it.

413
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,240
 And Brian goes, "You gotta jump, dude.

414
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
 You gotta jump over that wall."

415
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
 And Stanley's looking at it and he sees this flashlight beam on the other side of this

416
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,080
 hill of just debris.

417
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,920
 And he jumps over the wall.

418
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
 Not like, you know, Jack over the candlestick.

419
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
 Like I think he probably scrambled over it.

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,560
 I don't think he got a running jump.

421
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,200
 But anyways, he gets over the wall of debris.

422
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,640
 He immediately kisses Brian on the cheek and Brian goes, "Hi, I'm Brian."

423
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
 Very so normal, just reaches his handout.

424
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,720
 And Stanley goes, "Hi, I'm Stanley.

425
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,240
 We'll be brothers for life."

426
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,320
 And they both of their hands have been cut up as they're kind of moving through the

427
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,040
 debris and they shake hands.

428
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,960
 And Brian says, "I have no siblings and I'll be glad to be your blood brother."

429
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,400
 And Stanley goes, "Come on, buddy.

430
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,520
 Let's go home."

431
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,840
 They go back into the staircase.

432
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,040
 Now when the plane's impacted, it busted all of the water lines in the building.

433
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,480
 So the staircase is not only pitch black, it's flooded.

434
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,000
 Every step you're stepping on a wet stair in pitch blackness, only a flashlight to kind

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,960
 of light the way.

436
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,320
 There's only one stairway left intact that will actually take them downstairs.

437
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,960
 There was a quote about the situation in the stair, or just the situation in general.

438
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,800
 One of the survivors from the 77th floor, Jonathan Weinberg, said, "Whether you went

439
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,640
 up or down, whether you went left or whether you went right, that decided whether you were

440
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,600
 going to live or die that day."

441
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,920
 Because the thing with the staircases, there were only three staircases that went the full

442
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,040
 length of the building.

443
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,160
 And each staircase could only fit two people walking down it at the same time, side to

444
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
 side.

445
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,200
 So you would have situations where you would walk down one set of staircases, it's completely

446
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,480
 blockaded.

447
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,720
 So you would then have to walk up three floors, cross the floor, and then walk down another

448
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
 one.

449
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,240
 And then there were people who survived, said, "I walked up the stairs as everyone else was

450
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
 going past me.

451
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
 I never saw them again."

452
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,160
 Because they must have hit some sort of barricade or they smoke inhalation or something like

453
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
 that.

454
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,720
 "Whether you went up or down, left or right, determined whether or not you died that day."

455
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,520
 Luck, guidance, miracles.

456
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,360
 When that building was full of drywall, so when the plane hit, you had walls just collapse

457
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,800
 in on each other.

458
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,480
 People were getting buried under it, but you also were creating all of these barricades

459
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,400
 in the pitch darkness you couldn't get through.

460
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,960
 Only 15 survivors above the impact zone survived that day.

461
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,920
 Only 15 people who were above when that plane hit and that south tower survived.

462
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,480
 They were calling 911 and 911 was saying, "Just stay up there.

463
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,400
 We're going to put the fires out and you'll be fine."

464
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 Because that is what they've done for every high-rise fire throughout history.

465
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,240
 Stanley and Brian are making their way down the stairs.

466
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,400
 They are in the only stairway left that is completely intact that will take them all

467
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
 the way to the floor.

468
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,760
 And they don't know that.

469
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
 A true gamble.

470
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,000
 But it's not just two men walking down the stairs.

471
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,680
 You have hundreds of people moving down these stairs.

472
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,920
 Stanley has this quote about an experience they had on the stairs.

473
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,680
 We came across a security guard who was caring for a man who had broken his back.

474
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,800
 The man couldn't be lifted, so this guy was staying with him until the end.

475
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,640
 He said, "Please tell my wife and baby that I love them.

476
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,800
 These people are the unsung heroes of 911, not me.

477
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:24,960
 These are the people who said, "If I can't save you, I'm going to die with you."

478
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,600
 Brian and Stanley just look at the security guard and the man who is stuck there.

479
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,000
 And they continue making their way out of the building.

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,640
 In the North Tower, let's jump there for a second, you have some of the first responders

481
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
 in the building.

482
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,000
 Ladder Company 6, the firefighting team that's in the building to try to put out the fires,

483
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,400
 but at a certain point it simply became a rescue mission.

484
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
 Get them out.

485
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,360
 We'll get our equipment all the way up.

486
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,120
 One of the reasons why is you had firefighters trying to get up the stairs, the staircases,

487
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
 only two people at a time.

488
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,360
 You had too many people coming down the stairs.

489
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,800
 The firefighters though, all these people are coming down the stairs and on one of the

490
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,960
 landing there's a disabled woman.

491
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,240
 And people are trying to carry this wheelchair down the stairs.

492
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,640
 The firefighters get there and they're like, "You guys just go, you go, go, go, go.

493
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,960
 We'll get her.

494
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
 We'll get her."

495
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,600
 And they had a lot of incidents of that.

496
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,160
 They had like a hundred people who had disabilities that had a really hard time, if not impossible,

497
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,880
 to get down the stairs.

498
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,960
 They end up, the firefighters end up picking up the disabled woman.

499
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,520
 They begin coming down the stairs in the North Tower.

500
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,760
 And the North Tower starts to collapse.

501
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,240
 They hear the...

502
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,440
 [Exhales]

503
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,760
 Building shaking.

504
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,160
 It's just dissolving from the top down.

505
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,120
 These firefighters are looking at each other.

506
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,000
 And they're just running down the stairs carrying this disabled woman.

507
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,640
 And then everything around them dissolves.

508
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,440
 The wall just gives way, crumbles, dust, dirt, darkness, and then pressure on top of them.

509
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,000
 Those firefighters and that disabled woman, a miracle, found themselves in a perfectly

510
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,040
 formed air pocket.

511
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,640
 The debris just fell on top of them in such a way that all of them survive.

512
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:28,000
 Rescue crew go and take them out, find these firefighters, this disabled woman.

513
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Totally fine.

514
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,880
 I mean, obviously, some serious mental issues from it, but they survived.

515
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
 Miracle.

516
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,520
 Head back to the South Tower here.

517
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,520
 Stanley and Brian run out of the building.

518
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,960
 Fresh air.

519
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
 Look over.

520
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,280
 North Tower's gone.

521
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's just not there.

522
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,200
 And as they run out into the street and the firefighters are like, "Get back, get back,

523
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
 get back."

524
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:04,280
 Four minutes after they left that building, South Tower completely disintegrates, dissolves,

525
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
 collapse.

526
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,760
 Four minutes they had to spare to get out of that building.

527
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,240
 I said only 15 survivors above the impact zone came down the stairs.

528
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,200
 Only four people who were in the impact zone survived.

529
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
 And that was Stanley.

530
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,240
 Stanley was one of those guys.

531
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
 He was where the plane hit.

532
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,320
 He was one of four people who made it out of the South Tower that day.

533
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,680
 Now they have a 9/11 Memorial Museum and in that museum is Brian's flashlight and Stanley's

534
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
 shoes.

535
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,200
 This is a sense of survival that people use to escape the worst terror attack in United

536
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,000
 States history.

537
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,640
 Miracles are a really interesting thing.

538
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,800
 And it's one of those things that the word has actually really been dumbed down.

539
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,520
 A 1 in a million sports play is called a miracle.

540
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,680
 Because yes, it's a miracle.

541
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,600
 It should have never happened.

542
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,440
 Scientifically, logically, statistically it should have never happened.

543
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,840
 But it does.

544
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,960
 And when you have that touchdown against all odds, people say that's a miracle.

545
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,040
 But I think when most people think of miracle, and that's why I had some goofy examples

546
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,200
 for miracles in the beginning, kind of for the same reason.

547
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,840
 We use the word miracle all the time in all sorts of contexts.

548
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,680
 But a true miracle is the story of Brian and Stanley.

549
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,640
 They should have died.

550
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,640
 Statistically, they should have been dead.

551
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,280
 But each step in their journey down, they made the right decision.

552
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:54,200
 And miracles are also a very interesting phenomenon to look at because it's selective.

553
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,480
 They had their escape, but 3,000 other people died because of that same experience.

554
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,200
 And you go, where's their miracle?

555
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,280
 Why do these people survive and those other people don't?

556
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,440
 How come these people made all the right decisions and these other people made a similar

557
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,440
 decision but they had a worse outcome?

558
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,880
 An overall miracle to the whole thing is if the planes had hit at a different time of

559
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,800
 day, they expected casualties would have been around 14,000 people as opposed to 3,000.

560
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,520
 So that is a miracle in and of itself.

561
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,200
 But it's an interesting thing so we can look at stories of people who survive extreme events

562
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
 and go, that's a miracle.

563
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,400
 And they know that.

564
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,000
 But they wonder and the people who lost loved ones wonder, where was their miracle?

565
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,480
 Where was their miracle at?

566
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,680
 It's a super bizarre phenomenon.

567
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,720
 And you can either attribute it to luck, you can attribute it to divine intervention.

568
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
 But the divine intervention when you think again, if some sort of supernatural power,

569
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,680
 some sort of divine being was interfering in the lives of Brian and Stanley, why not

570
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,280
 these other people?

571
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,800
 And if it's luck, it should be strictly up to statistical chance.

572
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
 None of them should have made it.

573
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,600
 So what are miracles?

574
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,960
 It's truly an unexplainable phenomenon.

575
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,880
 We can talk about ghosts and Bigfoot and all sorts of stuff and measure feet and dung,

576
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,800
 Bigfoot dung, or you know rattling chains and spooky stuff coming through your door,

577
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,560
 aliens flying overhead.

578
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,640
 All of that stuff is fairly easy to categorize and debunk or prove.

579
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:42,440
 But a miracle is just a one time event that happens and somebody beats the odds.

580
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,600
 Miracles may be the most paranormal thing that everyone experiences over and over and

581
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
 over again.

582
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,040
 So while it might be nice to break out the Ouija board and play Charlie Charlie, not

583
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,480
 at the same time, that's just asking for trouble, but while it might be nice to explore the

584
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:07,040
 paranormal in that aspect, sometimes the most supernatural events happen all around us,

585
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,040
 because it's a miracle that we're even alive today to discuss this topic on DeadRabber

586
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,640
 Radio.

592
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,600
 Have a great one guys.

593
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:49,800
 Bye.

594
