1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 What would you do if you were staying at a hotel and all of a sudden you heard a little girl crying behind you?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 [crying]

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,200
 You'd probably help her, but this is a paranormal podcast, so something spooky happens.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:25,000
 And then, we take a look at two kids just hanging out, having a good time, at an abandoned mansion.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,500
 Everything was going according to plan, until they ended up in another universe.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving weekend.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 To all of you who showed up for the Thanksgiving livestream, man, that was really cool.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Thank you so much for stopping by for that. I had a lot of fun.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I hope you guys had a lot of fun too. It really is cool connecting with you guys.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We'll do another one on Christmas. I don't like to do them too often, because they take a lot out of me.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But I do really, really enjoy them, and I like to make it more of an event, rather than just doing a livestream every single week.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I tried doing that, I think, around season two, and it just was taking too much out of me.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 But someone who never takes too much out of me, they take out.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 They take out precisely the right amount. Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, it's one of our newest Patreon supporters.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Rolling on in is stinkbugpotato. Everyone give a big round of applause to stinkbug rolling on in.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Stinkbugpotato. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 We also have a merch store, and we do donations during the livestreams.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 The livestreams I do once every couple months, and that is another awesome way to help support the show.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And all those people are going to get shoutouts as well.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We've made a lot of donations coming in. I didn't expect that, guys. That was really awesome.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's grocery shopping time, ladies and gentlemen.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Stinkbugpotato. I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are gliding all the way out to Austin, Texas.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 [blows out air]

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Stinkbug, we are now in Texas. Thanks for gliding us all the way out here.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's Austin, Texas. And specifically, we're at the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So we're standing outside this hotel, and there's like trees going [blows out air]

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And there's like a duck flying by. It's a really nice, picturesque place.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I got this story from Steve-O Griffin. So thank you, Steve-O, for typing this out.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 The reason why we're at the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort is we're here to meet a young couple.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 We're going to call the dude David, and the woman we'll call her Michelle.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And so David and Michelle are walking into this resort, and they're like, "Oh dude, this place is totally awesome."

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I heard they have like spas, and like there's towels.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 There's towels in case you get wet at any point in your hotel stay.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It's a really, really nice hotel. I went and I checked it out.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I was hoping for some really funny reviews, because that's like one of my favorite pastimes, is finding funny battery reviews.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Very, very... [laughs] I live a very mundane life.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 But there weren't any funny reviews. It just turned out that this is like a $300 night hotel, and then apparently they have all these added fees.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Some people were saying they were paying $600 a night. Now that's not paranormal, right?

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 That's probably just crummy business tactics. But who knows, maybe they don't.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Maybe these bad reviews were all just vicious, vicious lies.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I have to have that part for legal reasons, so I don't get sued.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But anyways, if you need a towel, and you're in the Austin, Texas area, and you have $300, you can go to the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Get yourself a towel.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So this young couple, what were the names? David and Maggie.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 David and Maggie, or David and Michelle, he started cheating on her while he was at the resort.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And even in Michelle, they're having a good time at the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But then it comes time to do their laundry.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 So they pack up all their laundry, and they take it down to a separate part of the resort.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So hold all your questions till the end, because I know there's some local Austinites who are like, "Hey, wait a second."

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Or just people with general common sense who are like, "Huh?"

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Hold your questions till the end.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 They take their laundry down, and they say the laundry is away from the room.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So it's like, still part of the building, they said it's this long hallway.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It's all super spooky. There's cobwebs. There's still Halloween decorations of, ah, "Cloé of the Dark Skeleton."

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 There's this long hallway, and at the end of it is this laundry room.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And it's one of those laundry rooms that's just kind of like, it has no doors.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It's just like you walk in, and it's all these washer machines.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And you can imagine it as spooky as you want. This is like a five-star hotel.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So when I was first reading this, before I read the reviews, I was imagining this like some busted-up Motel 6 lights off.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 [imitates lights]

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's super gross. But it's a five-star hotel, so I'm sure that their light bulbs work.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Anyways, they go down this hallway, and they start doing their laundry.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And they hear behind them, actually before they even hear anything, David and Michelle both turn at the same time.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So they're doing this laundry in this room, and for whatever reason, they both turn at the same time,

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 and they look towards the entrance of the laundry room.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So it's just that opening. There's no doors there.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And right when they turn, then they see a little girl standing there, crying.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 [crying]

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And the little girl has a-- you know, there's different types of crying, right?

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 They're sad crying. They're sad because you just spent $600 at a hotel.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And then there's frightened crying, terror crying.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And that's what they could see on this girl's face. It wasn't that she was sad that she lost her mom.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 They see a look on this girl's face of utter fear.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And the little girl, still sobbing, still in a state of panic, turns and she looks down the hallway,

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 as if she's waiting for something.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Fearing something. No, she's waiting for Santa Claus to show up, right?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 She's looking for something that is pursuing her.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 But before David and Michelle can react, the girl realizes there's this flash across her face.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 The girl realizes it's here.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Whatever she was fearing is now coming down the hallway,

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 and she takes off running in the opposite direction down the hall.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So Michelle and David, they go and they poke their heads out of the laundry room,

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 and the hallway's completely empty.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Both ways. The impossibly long hallway, as it's described.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 There's no girl. There's no girl running down the hallway.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I would love for one of these stories to-- not anything, but I'd love for one of these stories to end where--

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and we saw this little girl and she was crying in the laundry room, and then she took off,

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and then we went and we looked out the room. We saw-- we still saw her running.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 She was only like 50 feet away, and then she ran, and she ran into the arms of her parents, and everything was okay.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So the next day-- hold your questions til the end.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 The next day, they're down at the receptionist desk, and they go, "Hey, you know, it was really cool.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I really like this place. Can I get a new towel? You know, I'm paying $600 a night.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Should at least get two towels. It's a really cool place."

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But I have a question. The other night, we were doing laundry in the laundry room,

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 and we saw-- and the receptionist cut them off. It was very, very, very, very poor because of her service

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 at the Hyatt Los Pines Resort. They'll interrupt you.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 The receptionist cuts them off and goes, "Let me guess. You saw a little girl at the laundry room."

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And she says, "Yeah, we get that report all the time."

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 This story stuck out to me for a couple reasons.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 One, it's a ghost story. Mine is paranormal. If I can't guess, ghost story.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's a traditional ghost story. Something along the lines of the Phantom Hitchhiker is a little more dynamic than that.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 You hear the Phantom Hitchhiker story once, and it's creepy, and then after that, it's super boring.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I can't believe people still report it. I guess people still report it because it happens to them.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And it might be the most exciting thing that's happened to them in a long time,

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 but just reading about some dripping wet girl getting in the backseat of your car

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 and then her disappearing before you take her home. Like, I don't know. It'd be kind of boring, right?

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 The other interesting thing about this story is I'm wondering...

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Stuff doesn't... I've been to a lot of hotels in my life, a lot of motels in my life,

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 and I'll say one thing I've never done at any of them.

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Is laundry? Right? Is that a thing? Do hotels? Do you do your own laundry at hotels?

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I've never, ever once done laundry at a hotel, so I'm thinking...

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Now, here's the thing. Originally, I was like, "What? This story doesn't even make sense.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Who does laundry at a hotel?" I just sit around in the same dirty clothes I showed up in.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I'm wondering if, one, the story's completely made up and it was written by someone who's never been in a hotel,

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 two, the Hyatt Lost Pines Resort charges $300 a night and makes you do your own laundry,

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 but you can probably save money if you do other people's laundry, or three.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Well, there really isn't a third one. I just don't understand it.

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So, I'm questioning... The reason why I wanted to tell the story is one, I do think it's creepy.

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I think any story that involves creepy little kids crying, no one likes to see that,

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 phantoms of girls being pursued by something horrible, like, is this a saga that's just playing out night after night?

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Just on the face of it, it's a creepy ghost story.

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You've got to think about all the times no one is in the laundry room, and that little girl goes and she looks in and there's no one there,

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and that she's even more despair, like, now she's just trapped in this hellish universe altar herself.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I guess it probably wouldn't matter if you solve two individuals, they're still unable to help you, but maybe it's some sort of solace.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But then I also think it's the whole story made up.

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Here's the thing, this is how Jaded, I just realized that, this is how Jaded I've become on this show.

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I just told you a story about a phantom girl being pursued by some sort of demonic entity,

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 or maybe the ghost of a serial killer, or some abuser from her past and she's trapped in this loop.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I totally 100% believe that that's possible.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I'm hung up on the fact that a motel makes you do your own laundry.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So, it's weird, I think I'm just that Jaded, like, I will believe in that supernatural thing, I don't think that other part is true.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But I wanted to share that story with you, because I think it's spooky.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And maybe I just really want to know whether or not you do your own laundry.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I think that might have been the whole segment, the whole point of that segment, I want someone to correct me and go,

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 "No, Jason, that's ridiculous, no one ever does their own laundry in a motel."

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But if they do, I don't, okay, here's the thing, I'm gonna stop talking about the laundry.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I honestly think I've spent more time talking about the laundry than I have the ghosts.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I find it fascinating, and it also is an interesting insight into me, where I will believe that story and the story coming up.

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 But I have a really hard time believing that a $300 a night hotel makes you wash your own jeans.

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Because it was their laundry, it wasn't like the bedsheets.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It was their laundry. I just like, I can't imagine a five-star hotel having a bank of washer and dryers.

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Like, you're on vacation, you're to the glorious city of Austin, Texas, music capital of Texas, you're there,

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and you're like, "Oh, I really want to go see that concert. Who's that dude hooting the blowfishes playing tonight?"

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But I have to do laundry. It doesn't make any sense to me.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 That is more fortian than anything else, but maybe I'm just sheltered. I love living hotels.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 My dream with this job is to travel the United States and the world investigating this stuff firsthand,

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 and putting out a daily podcast at the same time.

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I can do it. I can do it, universe. Give it to me. I'll take on that responsibility.

155
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I also want to give out a shout out to Steve O'Griffin. They're the ones who put this story out there.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So thank you so much, Steve O. Very, very fascinating story.

157
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I will title this episode, "Can You Do Laundry There?"

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And people will be like, "Whoa, dude, I wonder if he's talking about laundry in like the eighth dimension.

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I can't wait. I can't wait to listen to this episode."

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 "Stinkbug Potato, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carboner Cofter.

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 We are leaving behind Austin, Texas. I've dropped off all my laundry there. I'm like, "Wash it for me. I'll be back."

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 They're like, "What? You know, you paid to spend the night here.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Take us away from the Hyatt Los Pines Resort. We are headed all the way out to Mexico."

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 [imitates car engine]

165
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This next story is really awesome, and I got to give a shout out to Skechy Mert Vlank

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 for posting this and for keeping us updated on this story.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 When they wrote it out and when I read it, I didn't even know where the story took place.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 It was just such an interesting story I wanted to share with you, and then I was double checking some stuff.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Skechy, who from here on out we're going to call Sam, just in the past couple hours,

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 posted the exact address of where this took place.

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Because this story is really unbelievable, and people were like, "It's super vague. We don't even know what country you're from."

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Because he does say, you know, English isn't my first language, there might be some translation errors here.

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But people were super suspicious, and he was getting a bunch of hate, and he just posted the address.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's in Nuevo León in Mexico. He actually, I mean, he straight up put the Maylene address.

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I'm not going to read that out. But he did give the specific address of where this place was at.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So very, very interesting. I always love getting more information.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But what did we call this guy again? Sam. Sam is telling this story.

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And this story takes place when he's 14 years old.

179
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So we're in the town of Nuevo León, Mexico.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Every so often his dad would take Sam to work, and his dad worked at this company.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And where his dad worked this company, the business owner also owned several other properties surrounding the official company building.

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And one of them was this old family mansion.

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 They had moved on, so this mansion was starting to fall into disrepair.

184
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 But it was still there. It was still there, and they actually used it to store a bunch of their furniture.

185
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I've never owned one mansion, let alone multiple mansions, but I'm assuming that you just don't keep moving all the junk from one mansion to another.

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'm assuming you're just like, "Oh, that's my Sunday mansion. I check it out every so often."

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But never on Sunday, oddly enough.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Sammy is hanging out so much at the company with his dad that he meets the boss's son, R.C.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And they actually become fast friends, and they're kind of running around the factory.

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They're like knocking people into vats of oil.

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 "Ahhh!"

192
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 They're like, "Oh, those kids."

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 They're always running around having a good time.

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Having a good time in one place they like to go to is the abandoned mansion.

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 [makes weird noise]

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 The door squeaks open as they walk in.

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And it is exactly what you would picture.

198
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's a mansion, because I've said that word three or four times now.

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 But it's like all spooky and stuff.

200
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, it's not spooky like they intentionally made it spooky. There's a giant fake spider.

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But, you know, it's like dusty, and there's cobwebs, and you have this really, really fancy furniture,

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but no one sat in it for forever.

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 So it just looks off.

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 You're in that place, and you guys can already picture the smell.

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You can picture what I'm about to say, so I'm not even going to waste time saying it.

206
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 It's that.

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 This is a three-story mansion. It's massive.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 There's like an empty swimming pool inside.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And it's a mansion, and it's heyday. It was beautiful, but now the doors are rotting,

210
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 and it just has that whole ambiance of something that it's dead.

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 This is a dead house. It's going to need major repairs to bring it back to life.

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Now, while they're hanging out in the house, every so often they would hear a voice.

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 That wasn't one of theirs. They would hear like a disembodied voice somewhere in the house.

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 But they could never really prove that it was there. It could be a figment of their imagination.

215
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So they just keep on playing. And that's fair.

216
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 There have been times where I've been alone and I've thought I've heard something,

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 and I don't immediately go, "What was that? What was that?"

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And I leave, and I'm like, "I'm never going back there."

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 We hear things from time to time.

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 One day, though, these two fellas are sitting in the backyard,

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 and they have a little picnic set up.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 They have this stone table, and they got their food set up, and they're like, "Yummy, yummy, yummy.

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 This is going to be the best picnic ever."

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And just then, a security guard walked out of the back door of the house and is walking towards them.

225
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They're sitting there at this stone table, and there's company security guard is coming towards them.

226
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And Sam and RC kind of look at each other, and they realize, here's the thing.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 This house was off limits to everyone. They really shouldn't have been there either,

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 but their parents knew that they were constantly goofing off there.

229
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But they didn't let even security guards go into the house.

230
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 The one caveat to that is if a security guard was sent to find them,

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 if they were moving off a little too much, the ocean investigators were there to check all the people falling into oil accidents.

232
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 They wanted to talk to the two boys.

233
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 They would send a security guard to go find them, bring them back to the office.

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 So when they see the security guard walk out of the house, they think it's weird because they're not allowed in the house.

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 But if they were looking for them specifically, then sure.

236
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 This security guard was one that they knew, of course.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 You know, he's a security guard on the premises of their company.

238
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 When they get up and they start walking towards them, the security guard goes, "Hey guys!" and kind of waves to them.

239
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And then in front of their eyes, dematerializes.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They're now standing alone in this backyard, and they watched an adult vanish into thin air.

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 So this point, this point picnics over, right? Game time is over. You're out of there.

242
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 This isn't you imagining voices, right? This isn't like, "What? Was that you?"

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 It was just like a marble falling down the stairs.

244
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 This was a straight up human being you knew disappearing in front of you.

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And there's only one way out of the backyard. It's through the mansion.

246
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So they run in through the back door, and Sam goes, "The very first thing that happens when we get into the mansion

247
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 is it feels like metal spikes are being drilled through my skull."

248
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He says that him and RC started having extreme physical pain in their brains to the point of tears.

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Just this intense headache they could feel these sharp objects piercing into their gray matter.

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Sam feels his entire body become overcome with chills.

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 He's freezing. His hands are shaking. His bones are cold.

252
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 He looks over at RC, and he seems to be suffering from the same effects.

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And Sam looks out one of the mansion windows, and he notices that the sunbeams that are piercing through the glass

254
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 are getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer.

255
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 It is so cold in this mansion now. Sam can see his breath.

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Everything felt freezing cold to them.

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But an odd detail was Sam said the environment itself felt warm. We felt cold.

258
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And when we were breathing we could see that frost, because we could see that frost breath.

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But I could sense that around me everything was normal.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Now you can't stay here. You know the lights are dimming outside.

261
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 You don't know what's outside, but you can't stay here. You're suffering all these physical effects.

262
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So they continue to run through the mansion. They get to the front door and they open it up.

263
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 The mansion was right across the street from the company. So you had this big company building. You had all these street lights, all these cars. People just walking about taking smoke breaks.

265
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But when they opened the door to the mansion, Sam and RC look outside and the company building is gone.

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 All the cars are gone. All the street lights gone.

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They are now looking out at an alien landscape.

268
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 The mansion is now sitting in the middle of a desert, but not an earthly desert. Not a desert made of sand, but a desert made of some mineral that appeared to be metallic purple.

269
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And it just stretched all the way to the horizon.

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 The first thing they see, they're looking out of this alien desert. The first thing they see are these plants that kind of dot the landscape.

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 They are these plants with these weird geometrically shaped leaves that are half transparent.

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And Sam kind of looks at RC and RC kind of looks at Sam like, "Where are we?"

273
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And Sam goes to touch one of these plants and as he gets closer, his fingers, his skin begins to itch, begins to burn.

274
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He pulls his hand away.

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 That's when RC kind of nudges him into the bush. "Hey, hey, how's it going over there?"

276
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And nudges Sam and goes, "Look at the sky."

277
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Sam looks up and he realizes why the sunlight was dimming while they were in the mansion.

278
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 The sun is gone. The moon is gone.

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 But the sky is not pitch black. It's a pale, milky white.

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 It's a pale, milky white sky. They could still make out a few stars, twinkling in the distance.

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 But what really caught their eye was the lines.

282
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Sam said they could watch lines be etched across the sky.

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And he said it appeared that these lines are being controlled by something intelligent.

284
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 These weren't random shapes they were watching.

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Someone was driving those lights.

286
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Someone was moving those lights.

287
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Someone was purposely creating those lines.

288
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And just then, just when they come into that realization,

289
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 RC and Sam feel something in the very pit of their stomach.

290
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 We are about to die.

291
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It was this inexplicable horror that swept over both of them.

292
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 We are about to die.

293
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Something is about to take our lives and no one will ever know what happened to us

294
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 unless we go back into the mansion right now.

295
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 There's no time for debate. There's no time for remembering how horribly it was to be in the mansion,

296
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 physically horrible, to be in there.

297
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They knew if they spent any more time out here, they would be killed.

298
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 They would die on an alien planet, never to be found again.

299
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So they both run back into the mansion.

300
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And then if this story could not get any weirder,

301
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 all of that I really love all that detail, but this ending, I find super fascinating.

302
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 If the story could not get any weirder, when Sam and RC run into the mansion again,

303
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 first off it feels like they have to push themselves through an invisible screen of electrified air.

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 There was a barrier keeping them out or keeping this new universe from coming in.

305
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 But they push their way through this electrified wall.

306
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And then Sam and RC are in the mansion.

307
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But what Sam perceives is they appear in different rooms of the mansion at the same time.

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 So they walk into the mansion and Sam and RC are now in the, what's the thing called,

309
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 the lobby of the house, the foray or whatever.

310
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 They're in the living room.

311
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Sam and RC walk through the door, they're in the living room.

312
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And they're in the bedroom and they're standing in the bathroom on the second floor

313
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 and they're in the guest room on the third floor and they're in the kitchen and they're in the waiting room.

314
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Is that a room? I don't know. And they're in the room where you put your jackets.

315
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 They quantumly appear in this house.

316
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 When they enter the house, they are then in multiple rooms at the same time,

317
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 as if the universe is shuffling and trying to figure out where they end up.

318
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And this happens incredibly briefly, but even a second of this would be enough to break the human brain.

319
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 The next thing Sam and RC know, they're outside of the mansion in the backyard.

320
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Their food is sitting on the table. The picnic is ready to begin.

321
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 You could chalk it up to being some sort of dream or some sort of mass psychosis or some sort of gas leak.

322
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 All these hallucinations, but when they appeared back in front of this picnic table with their food,

323
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 they were both unbearably freezing cold.

324
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Their bodies were still frozen.

325
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 So they leave. Of course, they have to go back to the mansion to get out,

326
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 but they run out of the backyard, they run through the mansion, they run across the street to the company,

327
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and they begin, they're freaking out. They begin telling their dads,

328
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "Dad, please, I know you're not going to believe any of this. Feel how cold I am. Feel how cold I am."

329
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They tell the story about what happened. They got teleported to the southern dimension, and the parents don't believe them.

330
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And Sam says, "By the time he got across the street, we weren't cold anymore."

331
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You'd be surprised how much body heat you can generate running through a haunted mansion.

332
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And he goes on to say, he goes, "After that, I didn't want to go to work with my dad anymore.

333
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 There were times where I had to go to work with my dad, so I went then."

334
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He goes, "When I never went back to the mansion and me and RC continued to hang out,

335
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 but over the years we've stopped talking since then."

336
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 It wasn't because of the mansion-related thing.

337
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And again, this is where there was some translation stuff at the ending.

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I'm pretty sure this is what he's saying.

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 One version of it, you could say he never talked to RC again. You can read it like that.

340
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I think they continue to talk, but then after his dad left the company, he stopped keeping up with RC's how I read it.

341
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 But anyways, very, very interesting story.

342
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I don't think it deserved the backlash a lot of people were saying it was fake right from the get-go.

343
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I thought it could be true.

344
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And then when he dropped the address, when he dropped the exact address of the place,

345
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 and that'll be in the show notes, I'm not toxing him. It's in the links to the thing.

346
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I think that's cool.

347
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I'm really glad that he gave us that additional information. And I think when we're in the world of paranormal, this stuff can be true.

348
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Time slips and portals are honestly, to me, one of the more likely scenarios.

349
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I think that for being able... Okay, maybe there's my thing. I'm terrified of both of those.

350
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I think that's probably why I find them... Oh, shoot.

351
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Oh, I'm actually... I was clicking on some links here while I was doing this. Apparently, he's even naming the company.

352
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 That was something he left out in the beginning. Apparently, it is a company that still...

353
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It's a dairy company called LaGrange. LaGrange?

354
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 So right now you're drinking a bunch of LaGrange milk. Pssst, he spit it out.

355
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Yeah, apparently it's a Mexican milk company called the LaGrange.

356
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It's the same address. So they got some free product placement this episode.

357
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 So yeah, LaGrange milk company apparently is where this happened at.

358
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But portals, I find absolutely terrifying. I think that's something that could happen to you.

359
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 We talk about them all the time. I think it could account for not all weird missing people, but I think it could account for some of them.

360
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Where they just go missing altogether.

361
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Yeah, portals are really, really terrifying me. And we go back to the thing. Like, what if these kids didn't get out of the mansion?

362
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Like, we talked about that last week. It's all about following your gut. And not enough people follow their gut.

363
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 What if they were standing on that porch and they're looking at this alien landscape and they get this feeling of true fear, and they don't follow it?

364
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 What would have happened to these kids? What if there had been two kids who went missing in Nuevo León, Mexico?

365
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And they just went missing. And they'd be all sorts of maybe some serial killer came through. Maybe they got lost.

366
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Maybe it was predators. Maybe the milk monster finally got them.

367
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Super, super terrifying. And you would never find them. They would have ended up just eviscerated on this alien world at best.

368
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Right? At worst, they might turn into monsters themselves. I hate it. That sounds...

369
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 This show's become very Freudian for me, is that the right word? Because I hate portals and my worst fear is being turned into something against my will.

370
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Like, getting turned into a gremlin. That should be kind of cool. It'd have to be something that I wouldn't want to be.

371
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 So, like, I don't want to be a dolphin. Or just any sort of dumb animal. And be like, have the intellect of a human, but just, like, have to, like, walk around and kill mice and stuff like that.

372
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 That'd be, like, super boring. I'd want to watch YouTube. So, I hate getting... That's not the only reason why I hate getting turned into stuff against my will.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I saw a lot of horror movies when I was kids, I think, where people got turned into goblins. Where people got turned into statues and all sorts of stuff.

374
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And so, for whatever reason, that scares me more than being ripped apart on an alien planet. The point is, what if that this is a reason why people go missing and we don't find them?

375
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Or certain portals like that. But I also want to end it on this, because I've ended episodes like that before and I don't want to be repeating myself.

376
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 784 episodes in, I don't want to be repeating myself. The quantum mansion at the ending of the story.

377
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Like, that's a real game changer. We talk about portals a lot on this show, but that is such an awesome detail.

378
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Like, they step into the mansion and they appear in multiple rooms in the mansion at the same time.

379
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Now, there could be a slight translation error where it's not all at the same time where they do it one after the other.

380
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 But either way, it's super bizarre. Like, you can't be like, "Oh, they weren't all in one place at one time? What? Oh, that's lame."

381
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 It's still the universe shuffling them through. It was like the house was some sort of conduit.

382
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And it was trying to figure out how to put them back to where they were supposed to be. And it was trying out different realities.

383
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Were they here? Were they here? And then it found the right one and it deposited them back in the picnic.

384
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 That is so awesome. And that's one of those details that's so bizarre. I've been researching this stuff for 20, 30 years.

385
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Yeah, 30 years. I've been researching this stuff. And the fact of that detail, I mean, I think you guys can hear the smile on my face.

386
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I have not encountered that detail before. We've covered stories about people getting lost, like, dying in the wheel of time, kind of shuffling them through realities.

387
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 That was the closest I could think of. But this one, we have these... This one happened to two people. It wasn't just one witness.

388
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 We have two witnesses that are being... trying to be slotted back into the proper reality. Fascinating!

389
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Fascinating story. And it puts just another twist on the whole idea of portals.

390
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 It puts a whole other twist on the idea of where we are supposed to be.

391
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Like, had it put them into a different reality, then what would have happened? Would they have ran into themselves?

392
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 It almost had to put them into a reality where they had shifted out.

393
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 So you didn't have two salmon RCs running around. The whole thing is just mind-blowing.

394
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Like, the story itself is really interesting and I love portals. But the fact that you have a quantum mansion...

395
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 That we now have the address for, right? We now actually have the address for this place.

396
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 This is a place, again, that I would love to go visit. If it's still there. And that would be interesting if it's not there, would the conduit still be there?

397
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Why was the mansion abandoned in the first place? This is such a one-off story. And it would be interesting to learn more about it.

398
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But that idea of just walking out a door and ending up on an alien landscape, that terrifies me.

399
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And then coming back through the door, which was a struggle. That was a struggle. They could have gotten stuck out there.

400
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 It wasn't as easy as simply poking your head back in. They had to force their way back in and then the universe shuffled them.

401
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Absolutely fascinating story. And I know I say this all the time, I don't mind repeating this.

402
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 It's just another brilliant reminder that the world is so weird.

403
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Just when you think that you've heard it all, just when you think you've done all this research and you've heard all this stuff,

404
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 you come across the story of two 14-year-old kids who go from having a picnic to being on an alien landscape with some sort of intelligence drawing symbols in the sky.

405
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 An unseen threat lurking right around the corner. And then the multiverse appears and they are pushed into different holes through the multiverse until they end up in the right one.

406
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 That is just an absolutely bizarre story. And the world is so weird. And that is why we love it. And that is why we will continue to cover it.

407
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 For as long as we can.
