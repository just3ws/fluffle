1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 A woman has a close encounter of the "you turned" kind.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,500
 Cause she's driving on the road, you get it?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
 Welcome back, welcome back.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,500
 And then I've talked about it a long time, it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 it's always been a theory of mine as well,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,500
 and I think I have actually found a haunted website today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
 *I don't know what to say, actually I'm a lot better*

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to the season premiere of season 12 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too,

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
 I hope you guys had a lot of fun during my break, assuming everyone took a break as well.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 I want to say this too, not everyone listens to the bonus episodes,

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 the bonus episodes from last week, they each had an extra half hour of content.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,500
 It's the most in-depth behind the scenes we've ever done, and some of them even had follow-up stories.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,000
 Some of them talked about the new stuff that Trump's been saying about UFOs,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,500
 there's been information about people who have contacted me, that I've covered in the past,

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 like I've done episodes on them, friends and family and the subjects themselves contacted me,

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 a lot of really cool background information, so if you skipped those episodes, cause you're like,

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 "I already heard that one", check it out just for the bonus content,

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 most of them are double the length that they originally were,

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 I don't know if that's a selling point or not, but there's a lot of really good behind-the-scenes stuff going on.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Neil Hand, the Northern Irish kid.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 Neil Hand, take a bow there, do a little Irish bow, I don't know what that looks like, maybe it's just a normal bow?

23
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
 Maybe it's a normal bow, but you're scowling while you're doing it.

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 Neil, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode, thank you so much for supporting this show.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it, just help get the word out about the show,

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 that really, really helps out a lot, I'm going to look over at Neil, Neil looks back at me,

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 little, change secret glances, I'm going to toss him the keys to the Jason Jalopy, we're going to take a ride.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 First off, we are driving out to Finland, near, probably need to take a boat, probably need to take a boat,

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 but there's not a road that goes there yet. We're specifically headed to Sumonimimi, Finland.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 It's June 25th, 1992. We're driving down a dark road, it's 9pm, and in front of us there's another car.

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 And in that car is an unnamed woman, we're going to call her Nancy. Nancy's driving this car in front of us,

32
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 she's a 54 year old woman, driving, that's not exceptional, you are allowed to drive if you are a woman and you're 54 years old.

33
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 She's driving back to her cottage in Ristinia. Now, she's made this journey several times, this is where her summer cabin is.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 The road is straight, but then it turns into a hill, she comes up over the hill, and as she's starting to crest the hill,

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 she kind of sees movement at the top of the road. What she sees is two humanoids standing in the road.

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 They're little short dudes, they're only two feet tall, and one is standing further out, so one's standing right in the middle of the road,

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 and one is standing kind of on the edge of the road, and she's still driving her car, she's not slowing down,

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 but it appears that they're measuring something. And she describes these little fellas as two feet tall,

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 they're dressed in gray overalls with belts on. Do you need a belt with an overall? Isn't that the kind of point of having an overall?

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 Like, isn't it just a pair of pants that wraps around your chest? Or is that a cover all? I don't know, anyways, they were wearing belts,

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 they were wearing superfluous belts, they didn't need them. These guys don't seem mystical, they seem fairly alien,

42
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 they have big heads and large black eyes. Those are typical features we assign to gray aliens,

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 but I'm still a little torn on this story because gray alien, two feet is very short for a gray alien.

44
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 Gray aliens average three feet at the shortest, usually they're like three to four feet tall, so the fact that these are two feet tall

45
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 and wearing clothes, gray aliens usually walk around naked. But maybe these aliens were more shy, but maybe they just like belts,

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 and they could have just walked around just a belt, so they put on overalls as well.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 The point is that she doesn't particularly describe them as aliens, they could be human-esque, more humanoid,

48
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 but they definitely had big heads, large black eyes. None of this really matters because there's a thing going on called physics,

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 where her car is moving and she can't hit the brakes in time. So, she's coming up over this hill, she sees these little dudes measuring in the middle of the road.

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 The one who's farther off, so one standing in the middle of the road, one is towards the edge of the road, he turns,

51
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 sees the car coming, and jumps into a ditch. The dude in the middle of the road does not hear anything,

52
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 he probably got like an ion disruptor fired right next to his ear earlier in the night. He's just standing there in the middle of the road.

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 He's not looking at the car, he's probably wondering why his crewmate jumped in a ditch, he's like, "Oh, come on Barry, not again,

54
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 we have more hide and seek, we have measuring to do." He doesn't move, he doesn't react at all, and Nancy just keeps on going.

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 The car actually hits the creature, and she said the minute the car hit the creature, she heard a "mmm" noise.

56
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 Now, she didn't actually make that noise, it did kind of sound like March Simpson being stabbed to death.

57
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 She said it sounded like a metallic "mmm" sound, that was the actual word, N-I-U-U-H-H, so pretty close right?

58
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 She hits this thing, she hears this horrible sound, she's like, "Oh no, March Simpson!" She eventually stops the car.

59
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 I'm imagining she didn't do it right afterwards, I don't imagine she stopped her car in the middle of nowhere,

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 where you know a creature is hiding in a ditch, I'm sure she probably drove home, got some food, is it McDonald's driving?

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 "Nnngh!" Coming from underneath her car. Eventually though, she does check under her car, she goes to her car wash,

62
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 enters a road rally, anyways eventually she does stop her car and look underneath it, and there's no little dude.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 There's no like, lots of green blood or purple blood or regular blood, could have just been a tiny man, road worker out there.

64
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 There's no blood, no gore, she didn't notice that the plastic cover underneath her car had been torn out.

65
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 That's an interesting story that comes, I got it from a thing about it, Docs.com, they got it from an author named Mervi Vertanen,

66
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 who wrote a book called "Finnland", you can't get any more descriptive than that, it's just a book about stuff about Finland,

67
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 national landmarks, geography, running over aliens, it's all compiled in this book.

68
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 It's an interesting story because first off, we very rarely have stories where aliens die,

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 normal, we're going to assume this dude did not make it, right?

70
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 We're assuming that as she was on her cross-country journey, she's like, "Oh, I better get to my cottage, I'm falling asleep."

71
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 It's another 300 miles, we have to assume at some point, his lifeless alien corpse fell out of the car,

72
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 but you could also go into like, interdimensional, maybe he got hit by the car and then he's like, "Oh, wait, I can phase,

73
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 I can shift to the eighth dimension, I should have done that before the car hit me."

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 Whenever we come across alien bodies, they're usually related to UFO, they're usually related to things that are fantastical,

75
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 like UFO crashes or the military shooting aliens, military, you know, like combat engagements,

76
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 it's normally not like an alien, you just find a dead alien in like a rowboat in the middle of nowhere,

77
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 you're like, "What happened?" They're like, "Oh, high cholesterol."

78
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 What? Like, we very rarely have aliens die of natural causes.

79
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 I don't know if getting hit by a car counts as a natural cause, it doesn't actually now that I'm thinking about it,

80
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 but we very rarely see aliens get killed on accident, that's the actual cause of death.

81
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 So that's fascinating. It's fascinating too. Assuming this story is true, right? It could be completely made up.

82
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 We have the physical evidence as well, so she hits something, she hears the noise, and then there's physical damage to her car.

83
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 So you have those three different things. So this story should give hope to all of those out there who are afraid of aliens.

84
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 And I've said this several times on the show over the course of 500-some-odd episodes.

85
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 Aliens, especially gray aliens, are super weak. They're weak, dude. They got tiny little arms, they're only about three feet tall.

86
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 Their heads are massive, so it's just a big target.

87
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 The problem with hitting people, humans in the head, is their heads are so small, but aliens have the opposite thing.

88
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 And the reason why our heads are so small, I actually don't know if there's an evolution reason why,

89
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 but punching a head or shooting someone in the head is very difficult.

90
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 There's a huge gap between those two. Try punching them first before shooting them.

91
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 But punching them in the head, it's this tiny little thing, so you gotta do body blows and stuff like that.

92
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 Alien, it's the opposite. You would be harder to punch them in the liver, than you're just like, "Oh, the biggest targets on this guy are his eyeballs."

93
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 So you just punch his eyeballs, throw sand in them, squirt some glue in it.

94
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 It would be hard to miss a head shot with an alien. They're super fragile.

95
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 Apparently now you can run over with your car. I mean, the worst that happened with this woman is, you know, she probably had to pay out of pocket.

96
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 I don't think insurance covers... I don't think insurance covers manslaughter.

97
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 I wonder if she even told anyone, 'cause she's like, "Yeah, I ran over this little guy in overalls. Don't worry, he was an alien."

98
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 Is the insurance company is calling both the hospital and the police at the same time?

99
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 Like, you know what? You pay a couple hundred dollars to get your car fixed. You get to tell everyone you ran over an alien.

100
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 And again, don't be afraid of these guys. If a reptilian is messing with you, I have bad news for you.

101
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,500
 Those guys do seem to be pretty tough, eight feet tall, and they're pure muscle, but like, little gray aliens, dude.

102
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 I'm surprised all the trash talking I do about gray aliens.

103
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 Every show after one, I go to bed at night, I'm thinking, "Yep, tonight's the night they show up to show me the error of my ways."

104
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 But I think they know I'm a fighter, dude. I think they know I'm a fighter.

105
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 And I trash talk all the time. If I ever stop trash talking aliens, if I just stop covering gray aliens altogether,

106
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 you'll know I was abducted and taught a lesson. But until then, boys, let's show 'em who's boss. Let's show 'em who Planet this really is.

107
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 The reptilians, 'cause I can't beat those guys up.

108
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 Neil, we're gonna leave behind the Jason Jalopy. Let's get on board the magnificent carpenter copter.

109
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 Put on your little pilot. He brought his own infrared goggles. Doesn't need 'em. We'll be flying through the day.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 But it looks cool in 'em. So thanks, Neil. Looking cool in your episode.

111
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 And while he's getting suited up in his superfluous gear, I'm gonna use that word again, 'cause I like that word.

112
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 And while he's doing that, I'm gonna pull out this little DVD player because I'm old.

113
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 We're gonna go to YouTube and I'm gonna click "Play."

114
00:10:51,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 This Halloween, prepare yourself for the terrifying, suspense thriller, "Spell." Starring Omari Hardwick from the TV show "Power" and Loretta Devine.

115
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 Marquis, played by Omari Hardwick, awakens from a plane crash, imprisoned by a mysterious woman practicing hoodoo magic.

116
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 He desperately tries to break free, to save his family from the sinister rituals that await.

117
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 "Spell" is premiering at home on all digital platforms October 30th, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

118
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 I actually looked the trailer up for this movie, 'cause before the group will ask me if I want to promote a movie, I watched the trailer for this.

119
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 It looks dope. It actually, to me, it looks like a cross between Midsummer and Misery.

120
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 And that kind of, you kind of get that from this description. This guy gets trapped in this town, this, like, Louisiana, deep South Town.

121
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,500
 It looks really good. It looks actually pretty spooky, but that is the movie's spell. Definitely check that out when it comes out October 30th.

122
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:00,500
 Now Neil turns around and he's all spooky and all of his gear, all of his spy gear he brought with us. He looks like a cyborg.

123
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 Neil, fly this carbonar copter on out. We are headed to a casino in the deep South.

124
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 You're like chasing, there are no casinos in the deep South. But there is. Because we are going to land in a man's backyard.

125
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:28,500
 We're gonna sneak into his house and we're gonna see a man on his computer gambling online. He's losing a lot of money.

126
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 Now four months ago, this man who we're gonna call, I'm just gonna make up a name for him because this is a weird one because I don't want to get into the point where I'm doxing somebody.

127
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 But you'll understand my struggle as things go on. Let's call this guy, I'm gonna totally make his name up. Let's call him Mark.

128
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 Mark posts on a subreddit four months ago, a subreddit known as Problem Gambling. That's a rough subreddit.

129
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 It is a really rough subreddit to go to. You guys know that I go, it's not rough like gore.

130
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 We're gonna be talking a lot about psychological terror for this.

131
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 Now I know I'll be saying stuff, people will be like, "What? No way. Rotten is way worse." That's what we used to watch when we were not kids.

132
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 But I'm sure there's worse websites than Rotten. But dude, I go to this gore website. This stuff isn't terrible.

133
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 Gore websites, I understand why they exist and everyone dies eventually and people have this morbid fascination with people dying in bizarre ways and violence and stuff like that.

134
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 But everyone dies. But then you get an agent and you're like, "I don't want this. This is terrible stuff." Not good stuff to put into your brain.

135
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 But when I was in my 20s, "Oh, did you see that motorcycle accident on Rotten.com?" "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah." I mean, you just watch that stuff, right?

136
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 You have a morbid fascination with death. But not everyone becomes a gambling addict. See, the stuff we're gonna be talking about, it's horrifying on a different level, on a psychological level.

137
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 And then it gets even darker than that. So keep that in mind when I'm talking about how disturbing these things are.

138
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 I understand there's disturbing violence in the world, but then there's something darker.

139
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 Neil's like, "Great, this is the episode I'm on. He's taking off his night vision goggles." I was like, "Sorry, Neil."

140
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 Four months ago, this man, we called him Mark, posted on the Problem Gambling subreddit. And it is exactly what you think it is.

141
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 It's people... I go to it all the time now. I've become addicted to this website because I go to like the heroin subreddit and the meth subreddit.

142
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 I read all these subs about horrible things. And Problem Gambling is one of the worst, honestly, because it's people who go, "I lost $15,000 in the last two days."

143
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 I've never even had $15,000. People always talking about wanting to kill themselves because they owe $30,000.

144
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 They have like eight maxed out credit cards. This one woman left her kids at home to go gamble. She lost $8,000 that night.

145
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 There's one guy in the Balkans talking about how he owes money to Balkan mobsters. It's tough stuff to read before you go to bed, dude.

146
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 Problem Gambling. Mark posted this on here four months ago.

147
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 "I previously posted on here in early February about confessing to my parents that I put myself in about $10,000 in debt. I lost my entire life savings and it built up a pretty bad gambling problem at age 25."

148
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 He's in this situation. He realized he had a gambling problem. He stopped gambling and then his buddy at work started talking about options trading.

149
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 And he goes, "That's not like gambling. Like, it is. What? I mean, he learns that lesson."

150
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
 He goes, "That's a skill thing. Like, if he knows stuff about the stock market, I can make tons of money."

151
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 He ends up losing even more money doing the options training. He lost $1,000 in a day.

152
00:15:51,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 Two months later, he's back on Problem Gambling. "Gave away 80% of my paycheck this morning with an hours of it hitting my account. Deleted my online gambling account, but I feel truly helpless and sick."

153
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 A couple days later, he pops up on the Stop Drinking subreddit.

154
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 He's gone nine days without drinking. He says that's the longest he's gone within four to five years.

155
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 "I'm only 26 but have been drinking to the point of heavy buzz drunk five to seven nights a week for about the last three years."

156
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 One month later, he's on the trading card community. He lets them know he has a rookie LeBron James and a rookie Derek Jeter card and he's sure they're worth a lot of money.

157
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 Does anyone know where he can get these cards graded at?

158
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 The same month pops up on a medical condition subreddit.

159
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 He starts talking about how he's having problems with digestion. He thinks he might have Crohn's or IBS. Not for sure, but he's looking for any advice on what to do with his stomach.

160
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 He's also afraid it could be colon cancer, things like that.

161
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 Same month popped up on Stop Drinking again.

162
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 "Cross the major line" was the name of that post.

163
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 "I was blackout drunk last night and did something absolutely reprehensible. I'm absolutely disgusted that I'm capable of what I did. I'm never touching alcohol again."

164
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 A couple weeks later, he's back on problem gambling and Mark says since his last post has dropped another couple thousand dollars.

165
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 Two days after that, he goes to a subreddit called Breakups and he says that three and a half weeks ago,

166
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 he got dumped by his girlfriend who he had been with for three and a half years.

167
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 When he just talks about the tragedy of what that is, what that means to him.

168
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 "Thought this was going to be the girl I marry and then all of a sudden we haven't talked since it happened.

169
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 I cried a lot when it happened but have tried to make positive changes in my life.

170
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 I haven't drank since it happened and I've worked out every day.

171
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 Out of nowhere tonight, I burst out crying and have been laying in bed feeling the lowest I've felt since it happened."

172
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 He posts again in the Breakups subreddit and it's kind of the same thing talking about it just a couple days later,

173
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 like everything he's still going through.

174
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 "Pops back up a day later on the Stop Drinking subreddit.

175
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 Day 30 made it through a wedding without touching a drop.

176
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 He says, "The longest I've gone since I started drinking when I was 15,

177
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 excited to keep it going and continuing to work on myself."

178
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 One day later, back on the Breakups subreddit,

179
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 to say I've been a poor employee since I was broken up with one month ago,

180
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 would be an understatement.

181
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 Focusing on work just seems impossible and I just can't find it inside of me to care about deadlines or work goals right now.

182
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Fortunately, I've told my managers I was going through some personal stuff and they seemed to understand and be supportive.

183
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 One day later, "Sex Offender Support."

184
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 It's a subreddit where people, it's exactly what it sounds like.

185
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 I guess it really doesn't need any explanation.

186
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 One day after the post about the Breakups,

187
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 "Potential Sentencing.

188
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 I don't want to get into any specifics,

189
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 but I spoke to a detective today and it sounds like I'm about to be charged."

190
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 This occurred in a Southern state.

191
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 I just wanted to ask you guys about your experience with charges versus sentencing.

192
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 In discussions with my lawyer, it sounds like they hate taking sex offender cases to court, so you can typically plead to lesser charges.

193
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 I was curious to hear how it was for some of y'all.

194
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 I'm absolutely terrified and had hoped this terrible fuck-up of mine was not going to ruin my life, but here we are.

195
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 Just trying to take everything...a day at a time.

196
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
 He hasn't posted since.

197
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 Maybe later that day or the next day he responded to someone else on the "Sex Offender Support" subreddit.

198
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 Who was saying, "Things work out just fine, guys.

199
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 I was sentenced for five years for being a sex offender.

200
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 And look at me now. I'm married and I have a bunch of step kids."

201
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 And you're just like, "Oh my God. There's two things we have to unpack here.

202
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 But let me finish this story of Mark and then let me get into what I truly believe is a haunted website."

203
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 The reason why, this was a tough one because I didn't want to...

204
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 Listen, I don't know what this guy did, but I can almost guarantee he is super gross, right?

205
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 This stuff is posted publicly and I'm allowed to talk about stuff that I see, but I can't act...

206
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 There could be a legal issue if I gave you his username or gave you the clink, you know what I mean?

207
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 I could say I'm targeting this guy as much as he may deserve.

208
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 I don't know what he's guilty of. I'm assuming it's gross, right?

209
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 I'm assuming it's gross, but this was a tough one because I can't go, "Here's his username, here's his post.

210
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 There's not going to be any links."

211
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,500
 But I want you to think for a second, this is what I'm talking about.

212
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 I almost had a loss for words and I have so much to say at the same time.

213
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 You can follow this guy's journey through the subreddits.

214
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 He's definitely dealing with some issues of alcoholism and gambling addiction, and that's rough on anybody.

215
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 But when we get to that event, and it's so fascinating, I know not everybody loves Reddit, I have my issues with Reddit as well,

216
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 but the fact that you can track stuff back like this, it's almost like being a social archeologist.

217
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 I think there's actually a term for that.

218
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 One month ago, "Stop drinking, cross the major line." I was blackout drunk last night and did something absolutely reprehensible.

219
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 That matches up to when his girlfriend broke up with him.

220
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
 So what did he do? It's a fascinating story.

221
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,500
 And you watch this man slowly descend to the point where detectives are knocking on his door.

222
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 Now that post on sex offender support is gone. He's erased that, but his other accounts remain.

223
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 His other posts remain. He hasn't posted since.

224
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 So in a nutshell, that story's weird enough, but let's talk about haunted websites.

225
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 It's on the conspiracy theory iceberg. They have it listed as "Enchanted websites."

226
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 And I've talked several times on the show, like I said in the introduction, about haunted websites.

227
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 If a house can be haunted, if a doll can be haunted, a website can be haunted. It is a place. It is a place that we go.

228
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 I believe sex offender support on Reddit is haunted. I 100% believe that.

229
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 You can go to all the gore websites you want, but you're not going to find anything like you find on this subreddit.

230
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 There's no pictures. There's no videos. Nothing like that.

231
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 Every post on there is someone at the end of their rope.

232
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 It might be one of the most misery filled places I've seen on the internet.

233
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 Again, watch Go To Live League. I'm not recommending this, but you go to Live League, you watch Cartel beheadings and stuff like that.

234
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 It's not going to make your day. It's probably going to ruin it.

235
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 But there's something different about this subreddit.

236
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 Now, some of them are people who have gotten out of prison.

237
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 And they are there to give advice to the people. This guy posted the other day and he goes, "I'm facing 25 years.

238
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 What advice do you have for me going into prison?"

239
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 The dude was in his 20s, because again, I was going back through his Reddit history.

240
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 The dude was in his 20s, posting about rocks he found, how he should design his bushes.

241
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 That's all gone. It's like watching someone blow their brains out like any gore video.

242
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 But it takes 25 years to finish the film.

243
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 That's why this is worse than that gore stuff.

244
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 We were cutting each other's heads off for the past 100,000 years of humanity, bashing in people's skulls.

245
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 This is inhuman stuff, and you're watching people who engage in inhuman activity give each other advice.

246
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 It's so bizarre. There's something wrong with this subreddit. There really is.

247
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 I actually found out about it, because you guys know that I go to the meth, the heroin.

248
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 I go to the meth subreddit, heroin subreddit, opiate subreddit, drug subreddit, crippling alcoholism.

249
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 I check them every single night.

250
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 On the heroin subreddit, some guy goes, "Because they're getting ready to shut it down."

251
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 Reddit's about to shut it down because they keep posting photos of heroin and meth and stuff like that.

252
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 Reddit's starting to clamp down on them.

253
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 One of the heroin guys, his name is Mr. Heroin, said, "Whoa, you're trying to shut us down when this exists?"

254
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 I looked at the little link and I'm like, "What? Sex offender support? What is this?"

255
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 I clicked on it and I swear it's haunted.

256
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 I swear there is something wrong with this subreddit.

257
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 There's obviously something wrong with the people who exist in the subreddit.

258
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 You guys gotta understand, I go to all sorts of crazy subreddits. I go to the cult subreddits and the crazy subreddit, like the gangstalking, MK Ultra gangstalking, all that stuff.

259
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 I go to weird conspiracy subreddits where the people in the subreddits have mental problems.

260
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 It's nothing. It's something to the people.

261
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 They're running around, living their lives in a crazy state, but when you're reading it, you're like, "Oh, this guy's crazy."

262
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 Check this subreddit out. Check it out late at night.

263
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 I know you think I'm making some sort of weird, oh, spooky story to tell in the dark thing.

264
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 Check this subreddit out late at night. Scroll through it. Read the posts.

265
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 You'll see the same names pop up here and there. Some of the cases may interest you.

266
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 Check out their Reddit history. See how far they've fallen.

267
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 The problem gambling one where people have lost $15,000, $20,000 in the matter of 48 hours,

268
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 it has nowhere near the same emotional energy in it that this subreddit does.

269
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 I think there's something wrong with this subreddit. I mean, outside of the subject matter, it feels like you're navigating a void.

270
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 It's almost like there you can... It's hard to put into words, but I'm going to try, because this is a podcast.

271
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 The negative energy of these people actually fills the space around you.

272
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 It's terrifying. It's 100% terrifying. There's something wrong with it.

273
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 And like I said, I've gone to the gore websites. I've gone to the cult websites.

274
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 I've gone to these long rambling posts written by someone who's obviously in some sort of massive psychological issue decline.

275
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 That's a long way of saying they're crazy. This is totally different. Check it out.

276
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 You won't just be disturbed by the content and again, again, there's no photos, there's no videos, there's no links, nothing like that.

277
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 What it is, it's people talking about their life ending.

278
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 And it's not even like a cancer subreddit where they're like, "I'll never get to see my daughter get married."

279
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 Death is normal. What these people are doing isn't.

280
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 If a website can be haunted, this is it. You can actually sense the emotional energy. You can't sense it. You can feel it.

281
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 It's like a wet, heavy rug being thrown on you in a winter rainstorm. Their misery is palpable.

282
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 It was funny when I told Sabine that I'd first found this subreddit. She goes, "I have a question for you though. Do you feel sorry for any of them?"

283
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 And it's funny because I looked at her and I go, "No." I go, "And that's the weird thing too."

284
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 I go, "I always feel like I have such a..." The last episode of my podcast I said if someone gave Saddam Hussein a hug, we wouldn't have had the bath party.

285
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 But you can't feel sorry for these guys. It's an emotional void.

286
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 There is this sub, there is something going on with it.

287
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 I know this sounds like a super weird twist on Are You Afraid of the Dark, but I'm telling you, go to this subreddit.

288
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 Go to it late at night. Just scroll through, click, read.

289
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 You'll notice that the room feels a little bit darker, a little more heavy.

290
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 It could be because we are actually reading posts from people who have messed up so profoundly.

291
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 Not only are they going to prison, but they will be viewed as something other than normal for the rest of their life.

292
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 It could be because we are listening to people who are doing something that is inhumane.

293
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 And I've said this on past episodes as well.

294
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 A lot of times when people think of child abuse images, they think a 16-year-old girl who looks like she...

295
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 That's not what this stuff is. When people are getting arrested for this stuff, it's not a 16-year-old or 15-year-old who looks like she's 18.

296
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:22,500
 It's not what these people are being arrested for. Statistically, they are very, very young victims.

297
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 They don't go, "Oh, there's just some guy in..." Sometimes you'll see posts like that.

298
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 They're like, "Well, if a 21-year-old kisses a 17-year-old, you can get arrested for sex assault."

299
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 Yeah, that's true. That's not what these people are getting arrested for.

300
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 This is young. Statistically, it's very young victims.

301
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 So it could be the fact that we're sharing a digital space with people who prey on people under the age of 12, of 10, 6.

302
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 So it could be that these people are talking about disgusting things.

303
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 It could be that these people have committed disgusting acts.

304
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,500
 It could be any sort of thing, but I sincerely believe that this subreddit is haunted.

305
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 I'm not making a joke about it. I'm not like, "Ha-ha, isn't this funny? Subreddit's haunted." There's something wrong with the subreddit itself.

306
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 And I don't know exactly what it is. It's probably a lot of different factors.

307
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 All I know is that when you read these posts, it actually feels as creepy as standing in a haunted house.

308
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 Maybe not at first. You read a post.

309
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 Like, "Jason, are you really telling us to go to this subreddit?"

310
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 All I'm saying is that if you want to -- I don't even want to say if you want to experience it --

311
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 it is human misery focused at such a high level that I swear, like, when I'm sitting there and I'm on it and I'm reading these posts,

312
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 it feels heavy and dark the same way you would feel if you walked into a haunted house or into a spooky woods or into an abandoned cemetery.

313
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 If my theory is correct and websites can be haunted, this is one of them.

314
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 And because of my experiences reading this website, I hope I never find another haunted website again.

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

321
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 And I'm glad you listen to it today. You're like, "I wish I didn't listen to this episode. Now I'm scared to go to Reddit."

322
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 I love you guys. Stay safe, and I'll see you back again tomorrow.
