1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 Who would win in a fight, bigfoot, or a freight train?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,600
 We have a definitive answer to that question, which I'm pretty sure you guys already know

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,640
 the answer to, but we'll take a look at a story like that.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,520
 And then we meet a young boy who's hanging out at home alone in a house with no electricity.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,320
 Things are looking glum for the young man until his older brother shows up.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,880
 Or does he?

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:37,200
 [music]

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,560
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,960
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and get started.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,400
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,720
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Kyle Hughes.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,960
 Yeah, woohoo, come on in, Kyle.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
 Strutting on into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 Kyle, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, I totally understand.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
 You have no idea how much that helps.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,400
 Letting people know about the show helps the show grow.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
 That's good, right?

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
 Because it rhymes.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,960
 Everything that rhymes is good.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,200
 Kyle, I'm going to go ahead and toss you a shovel and a little train engineer outfit.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,640
 A little hat, a little wooden whistle.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
 And we're going to hop aboard the Carpenter Caboose.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,560
 Kyle, go ahead and start shoveling that coal into the engine.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,920
 We're choo, choo, choo, and all the way out to the US Canadian border.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,640
 Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 You like Jason?

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,080
 Did you pick this story just so you could keep making sound effects?

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 We're heading back in time to the 1880s.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,400
 And we're aboard this train that's currently chugging down a rail track near the US Canadian

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
 border.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,960
 That's as specific as it can get.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,240
 The country's just basically our friends all the way to the end.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,440
 I don't think there's a part that isn't connected to Canada, maybe except for Hawaii.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,160
 But we're chugging along and it's nighttime.

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're going to meet a crew on this train.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,840
 This isn't one of those Fufu passenger trains where they like hand out snacks and people

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,960
 get murdered, 10 people murder one person at the same time.

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
 Spoiler alert.

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
 It's a like shipping train.

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,720
 So they got like flat cars and then cars full of stuff, a car full of dead hobos.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,360
 And you just have this train chugging through the night up at the US Canadian border.

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
 And on this train, there was an engineer.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,920
 We don't have his name listed, but we're going to go ahead and call him Jerry.

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,840
 So Jerry's working on this train as an engineer.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,200
 He's looking out the window and he's like, yep, still moving in a straight line.

54
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 Still nighttime.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,240
 Now I get to take a break for an hour or two, because I don't know what else I'm going to

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 do on this train.

57
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,400
 The train is chugging down the track, but then disaster strikes.

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,760
 All of a sudden it rams into something and this thing is so large that people on the

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,400
 train feel the impact.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,680
 Now I'm sure if a train hit like a baby deer wouldn't even notice it.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,320
 I'm sure the guy up front, we get deer guts all over him.

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,840
 Maybe he hit a couple quails, right?

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,280
 You wouldn't notice it would have to be something large that when you hit it with a train, everyone

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,240
 on board goes, what's that?

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,280
 What it hit was so big, it actually started to slow down the train.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
 What had happened was this creature, they're assuming, right?

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
 A moose, maybe?

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
 What could possibly be this big up in the middle of nowhere?

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,400
 They could tell that it mangled up the cowcatcher.

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,240
 Whatever it hit was so big it actually broke the cowcatcher.

71
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,920
 Now the cowcatcher is dragging along the rail.

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
 Sparks are probably flying up in everyone's faces.

73
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,720
 Ah, ah, I forgot my goggles at home.

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
 And so they pull the lever.

75
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,520
 I'll tell you right now, everything I know about trains are from cartoons, right?

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,600
 They pull the lever, the steam whistle goes, woo, woo!

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,280
 And the train slowly comes to a stop.

78
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,600
 Steams blowing out of somewhere.

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,080
 Because it's a train, I'm assuming it's a steam train.

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,400
 And everyone gets out with their lanterns to see what?

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
 Intarnation could we have hit.

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,880
 What could have been so big that it would have slowed this train down?

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,000
 So they get out with their lanterns and they're walking towards the front of the train.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,520
 And they see like the cowcatcher is all mangled.

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,800
 They just see a little bit of it, right?

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,560
 Because they're kind of walking up alongside the train.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
 They see a little bit of it.

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
 And then the guy's moving his lantern like super fast so they can't get a good view,

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
 but it's extra suspensy.

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,840
 What they do is when they finally get that guy to hold his lantern like a normal person,

91
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,320
 they can clearly see that the cowcatcher, yes, is mangled, but it didn't hit a moose.

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:48,120
 What they see tangled up in the cowcatcher on the front of the train is an ape.

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,960
 They're looking at this giant monkey body dead, tangled up, and the mangled remains

94
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,480
 of the front of the train.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,840
 The guys realize that there shouldn't be any apes out here, right?

96
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,520
 You don't have to be a biologist to realize there shouldn't be any apes in the US Canadian

97
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 border.

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,760
 There shouldn't be any apes anywhere in America or Canada.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,360
 What's this ape doing on the front of the train?

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,200
 How did it get out here and it got killed by us?

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,000
 They also realize they have to repair the cowcatcher.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,040
 They just can't stay out here forever because they also know and they start to catch glimmers

103
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,240
 of it in the darkness.

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,600
 There are natives in the woods watching them.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
 So they're like, okay, this is not a good situation.

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,000
 One, there might be a ton of monkeys out here, but we don't know if this is the only one

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,640
 or if we're surrounded by them.

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,800
 Two, even if there aren't any monkeys, this might end up badly if a bunch of Native Americans

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,400
 and Native Canadians, is that the term?

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,120
 They're literally on the border and you have Native Americans and Native Canadians on both

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
 sides.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
 They're like, ah!

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
 This could end badly.

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,920
 They could get us as well.

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,240
 Let's go ahead and get this monkey off of this train, which sounds like a great title

116
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 for a kids book.

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,200
 Let's get it out of the cowcatcher.

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,440
 So they start to remove the ape's body.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,600
 This story was told to us.

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,000
 The engineer who worked on the train told the story to his granddaughter, who then told

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,960
 it to a Bigfoot researcher much, much later in life.

122
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,200
 The engineer says, "It took six of us, six of the strongest men to ever work the railway.

123
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,680
 I was the strongest of them all and also them was handsome.

124
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,040
 It took six of us to move this monkey's body."

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,440
 I keep saying monkey, I keep saying ape, which are two totally different species.

126
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,640
 He keeps saying ape, I just always default to monkey because I think it's kind of a

127
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
 funny word.

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,880
 It's an ape, but it's not like a normal sized ape.

129
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
 The engineer said this thing had to be at least eight feet tall.

130
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,840
 Eight feet tall ape, which I think a gorilla.

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,600
 Like gorillas don't look that tall, right?

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,960
 I know they walk around on all fours and then they bang their chest until Tarzan shows up,

133
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
 but they're not that tall, right?

134
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,040
 You could probably walk up to an ape, assuming there's like a electrified barbed wire between

135
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,840
 you and him and look him in the eye.

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
 I don't think that apes are super big.

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,120
 I think guys, I think you guys are quickly realizing I know everything about science

138
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,440
 from cartoons and the apes are purple and they solve crimes.

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
 I don't think apes are eight feet tall.

140
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,240
 I think that'd be too tall for any primate, right?

141
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,560
 I'm sure you could go up and like poke an ape in the chest, assuming that you're wearing

142
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,360
 some sort of armor, you're in a mech suit and there's electrified barbed wire between

143
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
 you.

144
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,000
 This ape was eight feet tall and it took the six men to move it.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,120
 He estimated that the thing weighed about 500 pounds, which to me doesn't seem like

146
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
 a lot.

147
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
 I couldn't bench it.

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 I'm not saying that.

149
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
 I'm not saying that.

150
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
 I'm like, get out of the way, guys.

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
 I'll pick them up myself.

152
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,800
 I throw my back out and they just leave me there in the darkness.

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
 No.

154
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,720
 You're eight feet tall and you weigh 500 pounds.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,200
 Basically each foot of you would only weigh 90 pounds, which is that normal?

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 Like I imagine he would be like super linky.

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,120
 But I guess it doesn't matter if it looks like he works out in the gym.

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,200
 It's eight feet tall ape in the middle of nowhere.

159
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
 You want to be like, oh man, do you even lift?

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 Like he's a giant monster.

161
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,960
 I don't think you would make fun of him whether or not he was dead or alive.

162
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,320
 Anyways, they take this 500 pound monster.

163
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
 Eight, really.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,000
 They're not even thinking it's a monster and they throw it in an open flatbed car and

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
 they go, let's just toss them in there.

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
 We'll deal with it later because that's definitely an anomaly.

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,560
 I mean, at the very least, we can take it to some doctor, some scientist or something

168
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,600
 like that and in the most, maybe we can cut off his hands and make wishes.

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,560
 They throw them in the back of this flat car is what it's called.

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,200
 And then they're like, okay, that was mission one.

171
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,240
 Now we got to fix the cow catcher because the train won't be able to go as long as

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
 this cow catcher is mangled, right?

173
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,160
 And the engineer, I already forgot the name I made up for him, Eddie the engineer.

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,280
 He changed his name in the middle of the story.

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,080
 He's like, I don't feel like that old name.

176
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 Call me Eddie.

177
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
 And they're like, seriously?

178
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,120
 You change your name every single hour.

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,600
 And he's like, who knows what'll be next?

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,000
 Eddie the engineer and his buddies then they set to work at fixing the cow catcher.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,200
 And he said it took about two hours to straighten it out.

182
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
 They're working in the dark.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,040
 They just are working by lantern light.

184
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,000
 They're trying to morph steel in the middle of nowhere with the basic tools possible.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,400
 And they really do notice that they are natives kind of surrounding the train.

186
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,160
 They don't, they're not doing anything to the crew.

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,720
 If anything, it seems like they're more interested in what is going on writ large.

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,440
 Meaning the dude in the back.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,680
 They're very interested in what's going on with that monster in the back.

190
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,560
 Well, they finally get the cow catcher fixed and then one of the crew members goes back

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
 to the train car to take a look at the ape monster.

192
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,120
 And the crew member realizes the apes corpse is gone.

193
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,920
 So the crew goes, you know what?

194
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
 I really wanted to make my wishes.

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
 I didn't get a chance to make my wishes.

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,120
 They realize that this thing wishes or not is an anomaly.

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,760
 They should bring it back.

198
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,080
 So they start tracking it.

199
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,720
 And sure enough, they're able to track it because they see like, oh, a bunch of bushes

200
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,080
 are knocked over and they're like, hey, the natives went this way and they must have carried

201
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,600
 this body off and they're walking along.

202
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
 And then a guy finds some fur on a tree is like, ah, a clue.

203
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
 And then they just kind of keep walking.

204
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,360
 I also forgot to mention this guy was super smelly.

205
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,200
 This ape smelled, which is a common thing we see in Bigfoot stories.

206
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,120
 But anyways, they're walking, they're following it.

207
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 They can follow the smell.

208
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
 It's so pungent.

209
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,040
 They can follow it through the darkness.

210
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,280
 So eventually they lose the track.

211
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
 They get to a point.

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,640
 It's just not, they can't smell anymore.

213
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,880
 There's no more bramble being knocked over.

214
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,280
 It has disappeared into the night, along with the natives that were surrounding the train.

215
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:03,240
 So the thing is, is that what they figured was that the most likely explanation was that

216
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,800
 this was an ape that it must have escaped some sort of circus or sideshow, right?

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,720
 It broke out of the cage and ran up into the forest and was hanging out there for a while.

218
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
 He's like, no bananas.

219
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 Oh, I should have stayed.

220
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,440
 I should have stayed a slave to that cruel circus master.

221
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,080
 But one thing they were thinking of when they were kind of debating this theory is that

222
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,200
 they took a good look at this monster and they realized even though it looked like an

223
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600
 ape, it didn't have ape-like teeth.

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,760
 They didn't have like those big fangs that an ape will have.

225
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,720
 It actually had human teeth.

226
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,680
 They said it had human teeth, but they were like spaced widely apart.

227
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
 One of the guys kept that hair.

228
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,000
 He kept that hair that he found on the bush and they actually gave it to a scientist at

229
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 one point.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 He's like, what do you want me to do with it?

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 What do you want me to do with this hair?

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And they're like, I don't know.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's just weird hair, right?

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,720
 We find that all the time in the forest maybe belong to something.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,680
 It's a fascinating story, right?

236
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,360
 I really tried looking into the physics of it.

237
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,520
 Like if a train hit something 500 pounds, would it stop?

238
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,840
 Would the cow catcher get mangled?

239
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,160
 But I have the Internet of 2022, not the Internet of 1880s.

240
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,520
 For all I know, this was a common problem.

241
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,240
 The cow catchers were constantly getting mangled if they hit anything too big.

242
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,320
 And that let me down a rabbit hole where I was finding out if a human got hit by a train,

243
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
 what would happen to them?

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,680
 The answer is nothing good.

245
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,360
 They said at the very least, maybe have a glancing blow.

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,600
 Maybe someone's like hanging out the window going to give you a high five and you don't

247
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,280
 know when they slap you across the face.

248
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,320
 You're not going to blow up.

249
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,720
 But if you get hit by a train directly, sometimes you get thrown to the side and you're fine.

250
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
 Sometimes you're obliterated.

251
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,000
 And then sometimes you're thrown to the side and obliterated.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,440
 Like it's all sorts of physics involved.

253
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,920
 But those modern trains tend not to break.

254
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,880
 So the question is, and to be fair, modern humans, these trains are hitting these people,

255
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,680
 they're not eight feet tall and 500 pounds.

256
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,720
 They're not 90 pounds per foot.

257
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
 So that's the question.

258
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
 Is this physically possible?

259
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,920
 Like that's kind of where it's hung up.

260
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,760
 But Rita Smith swears that her grandpa never told her anything false or never told a story

261
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
 that wasn't true.

262
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,720
 I'm sure if she goes, "Did you eat my last fruit rollup?"

263
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 He's like, "No."

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,640
 As he's going through diabetes, they're like, "Grandpa, I can obviously tell you need your

265
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 insulin shot.

266
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,680
 You ate all my fruit rollups, didn't you?"

267
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,520
 But as far as tales go, she said, "He never told me a false tale.

268
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,640
 He never told me a story that wasn't true were her exact words."

269
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,160
 Read me the story about the gingerbread man.

270
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
 And he's like, "No, I'm going to read you this technical manual on how to be an engineer

271
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,960
 on a train because I don't tell stories that aren't real."

272
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,920
 But otherwise, it's a fascinating story, right?

273
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,420
 Was it a bigfoot?

274
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,760
 Was it an ape?

275
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,920
 How many bigfoot sightings were actually an ape?

276
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,160
 I think that's so fascinating, something that gets kind of brushed aside a lot.

277
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,320
 They, in an area that you had a monkey loosen running around the woods and somebody saw

278
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,240
 that monkey, for the next hundred years that legend would grow.

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,960
 It's the same thing like the alligator and the sewer.

280
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,680
 If you saw one alligator, if there was ever a news report of one alligator and the sewer

281
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,120
 for the next hundred years, they're like, "There's all over the sewers in New York."

282
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,240
 I wonder how many of these bigfoot legends were started by something real.

283
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
 But we don't know, right?

284
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
 Could it have been a bigfoot?

285
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
 Could it have been a Sasquatch?

286
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,120
 Could it have been an ape?

287
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,160
 Why were the natives so eager to get it?

288
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,400
 Why are they so eager to get this smelly prize?

289
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 Was it their pet?

290
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 Who knows?

291
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,960
 I'm just making stuff up now, just guessing stuff.

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,920
 Kyle, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonicopter.

293
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,000
 We're going to leave behind the US-Canadian border.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,600
 We're going to head all the way out to the Philippines.

295
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,080
 [imitates the sound of the Philippines]

296
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,360
 I found this story online. It was written by someone who goes by the handle Ninetales.

297
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,960
 We're going to go ahead and call him Tony.

298
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,000
 We're headed back to year 2021, so very, very recent story.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
 It's 2021. We're in the Philippines.

300
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,720
 It's currently the middle of the day, and Tony is at home alone.

301
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,560
 Tony says, "I have two older brothers, and they're very, very devout."

302
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,200
 To the point that they would spend most of their free time at the church across the street.

303
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
 But I was kind of too lazy.

304
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,680
 He's like, "Getting on my knees and praying.

305
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
 Ah, that's too much work.

306
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,000
 I'm going to sit here on the couch and read a book."

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,240
 He accidentally picks up the Bible.

308
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
 He's like, "No, I've been tricked."

309
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,200
 He says, "My two older brothers, they're very, very devout.

310
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,960
 They spend all the time at the church.

311
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,360
 That just wasn't for me."

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,280
 So I'm just hanging out at home there across the street.

313
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
 Totally fine, right?

314
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,160
 If anything goes wrong, I know where my brothers are at.

315
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
 It's going to be okay.

316
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,960
 We don't know Tony's exact age, but it does seem that Tony is underage, you know, younger

317
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
 at this point.

318
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,480
 And it's only just last year.

319
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,720
 And the reason why Tony's reading a book and not doing anything cool is because the electricity

320
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,400
 is off at the house.

321
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,960
 They have absolutely no electricity.

322
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
 So he's just kind of hanging out.

323
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 He's doodling.

324
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,960
 He's checking his phone.

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,400
 He's like, "Oh, no, 1%!

326
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,520
 Oh, man.

327
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
 Pretty soon all the fun's going to end."

328
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:18,200
 He's sitting there and then all of a sudden the front door opens up and in walks one of

329
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 his brothers.

330
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
 We're going to go ahead and call this guy Marcus.

331
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,000
 Marcus walks into the house and just kind of walks through the house straight back to

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
 the bedroom, shuts the door.

333
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
 Tony's like, "Okay, whatever, you know, I'm still sitting here.

334
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,360
 Doodling, hanging out, reading this book.

335
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
 All the stuff.

336
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,680
 There's pretty much all you can do with the electricity off.

337
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
 It's okay."

338
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 Well, the day continues on.

339
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,280
 The sun begins to go down.

340
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,480
 And it's time to start lighting candles.

341
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,600
 It's time to actually have some light.

342
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,760
 Once it gets dark, you don't want to be sitting in the pitch blackness.

343
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,680
 Tony starts getting up and start looking for these candles and he can't find any.

344
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,400
 Dang it, he's opening up the junk drawer.

345
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,920
 He's like, "Oh, man, all these 9-volt batteries.

346
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 He's looking around.

347
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,480
 He's looking in all the ordinary places.

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
 They keep the candles.

349
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
 Can't find any."

350
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,280
 So he walks over to the bedroom.

351
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
 "Hey, Marcus.

352
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,040
 Marcus, hey, I can't find any candles.

353
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,840
 Marcus gets up, goes, "Hey, come with me.

354
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 Come with me.

355
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,160
 Let's get the electricity back on.

356
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
 Let's just do that."

357
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
 Tony's like, "What?

358
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
 What?

359
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
 What?

360
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 What?

361
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,560
 You're going to go earn a bunch of money so we can pay these bills?"

362
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
 Marcus is walking through the house and he's like, "No, just come with me, man.

363
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,800
 We're going to turn the electricity back on."

364
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,400
 They go outside and Marcus directs Tony to the electric meter.

365
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,840
 He goes, "Listen, grab a screwdriver, get some pliers, come back here.

366
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 We're going to open this up.

367
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
 We're going to fix this situation."

368
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,600
 Tony's like, "Okay."

369
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,880
 So he gets the screwdriver and the pliers and Marcus goes, "Okay, what you need to do?

370
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,200
 You see that seal there?

371
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,520
 Break that seal and then pull the cover off."

372
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
 You see that, Tony?

373
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
 Right there.

374
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 You see that little plastic chip?

375
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
 I need you to pull that out.

376
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 Tony's like, "What?

377
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,520
 Okay."

378
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,440
 And Tony reaches in and he pulls out the plastic chip.

379
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
 He goes, "Okay.

380
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,800
 Go ahead and put the cover back on and let's go and turn on the light switch."

381
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,440
 I was like, "What are you talking about?

382
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
 Seriously?

383
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
 It's that easy."

384
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,240
 So Tony and Marcus walk back into the house and Tony goes and flips the switch on.

385
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
 Light comes on.

386
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,640
 Tony goes, "It's that easy?

387
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
 We can just turn on the electricity?"

388
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,760
 Marcus's like, "Yeah, sure.

389
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
 Is that easy?"

390
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,200
 Walks down the hallway, goes back into the bedroom.

391
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
 Tony's like, "Dude, this is dope.

392
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
 I'm sure eventually we're going to get in trouble for this.

393
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
 The power company may see that all of a sudden.

394
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,120
 The people who aren't paying their bills are somehow consuming more electricity."

395
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,960
 He's like, "Okay, but that's cool, man.

396
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
 We've got the lights on."

397
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
 And at that point, Tony's phone rings.

398
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
 Tony's like, "Okay, cool."

399
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,920
 Pulls his phone out, answers it, and puts it to his ear.

400
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,280
 It's Marcus.

401
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,560
 Marcus is calling Tony and says, "Hey, Tony, we're going to spend the night here at the

402
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
 church.

403
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 You should come over here.

404
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
 The electricity's on and they've got food.

405
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,080
 Come on over."

406
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,120
 Tony's sitting there holding the phone.

407
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,320
 He goes, "Marcus, come on.

408
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 What are you doing?

409
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 Is this some sort of joke?"

410
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 "No, what?

411
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 No.

412
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 Come on.

413
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
 No, the church just have electricity.

414
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 That's not a joke.

415
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,960
 They actually have electricity over here and they have some food.

416
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,160
 Let's come on over and we'll spend the night."

417
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,040
 Tony goes, "Marcus, where are you right now?

418
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,560
 At the church."

419
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:46,160
 Now, Tony is walking through the house and he's continuing to talk to Marcus.

420
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,440
 And he's walking towards the bedroom.

421
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,560
 And he's expecting that this is all a joke, that Marcus is calling him from the bedroom.

422
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,160
 But as he gets closer and this conversation continues, he can hear Marcus on the phone,

423
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,440
 but he doesn't hear a voice coming out of the bedroom.

424
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,320
 Marcus walks down the hallway and he turns and he looks into the bedroom.

425
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,160
 It's completely empty.

426
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 Pure terror grips Tony.

427
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:28,800
 And he said he began to slowly walk through the house, trying to make as little as noise

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,360
 as possible.

429
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,040
 He said, "I'm walking through the house and I'm checking every corner.

430
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,080
 I'm looking for whatever was in here, for whatever was impersonating my brother.

431
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,360
 It might still be here."

432
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,840
 He's looking around.

433
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:57,360
 He slowly starts to get dressed and then quietly makes his way out of the house.

434
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,400
 He opens the front door.

435
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,120
 He sees the church across the street.

436
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,360
 In his mind, this still has to be a joke, right?

437
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,400
 This is impossible.

438
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
 Across is the street.

439
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:15,000
 He goes inside the church and there in the church are his two brothers.

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,200
 He immediately bursts out crying when he sees them both over there.

441
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,640
 It's a creepy story.

442
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,240
 We have covered a lot of stories like this on the podcast.

443
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,040
 But if memory serves me, I'm going to put a couple of them in the show notes.

444
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,120
 If memory serves me correctly, there is never a word spoken from this doppelganger.

445
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 I could be wrong.

446
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,480
 My memory is faulty.

447
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,240
 I've put out 940 episodes at this point.

448
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,840
 We had the one where the two girls went into the school basement, but three came out.

449
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,800
 We have these stories where people are actually calling out to the other version of the person.

450
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,160
 They're seeing someone who shouldn't be there walking in a different direction.

451
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:12,160
 This one we have somebody impersonating Tony's brother and then giving them completely valid

452
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
 information.

453
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,880
 I actually looked, this was like, I'm trying to find out can a cow catcher get mangled?

454
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,280
 If it hit something large enough, this was something I was checking out.

455
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,440
 And there are new smart readers that there is a way.

456
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,760
 I mean, legally, I probably shouldn't have given you all those instructions.

457
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,720
 Please don't electrocute yourself.

458
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,880
 You can go on YouTube and these new smart meters, you can pop it off and they say in

459
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,840
 the YouTube videos, do not do this, this is for education, but here's a step by step guide

460
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,480
 to get your electricity back on.

461
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,280
 Marcus didn't interact with the meter.

462
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,600
 Marcus never picked up the screwdriver or the pliers and never pulled anything off.

463
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 He just instructed his brother on how to do it.

464
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,720
 Whenever we talk about doppelganger stories like this, the usual suspects show up.

465
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,480
 Sometimes we think it might be demonic, right?

466
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,720
 Something impersonating a loved one to try to get you to follow them.

467
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,640
 Sometimes we think of alternate universes, like someone is standing in between two realities

468
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,240
 and seeing the opposite.

469
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:22,240
 But again, this one, the person, the other accurately gave information that helped Tony.

470
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,480
 It's a fascinating story and it would terrify you.

471
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,200
 There obviously is the possibility that this was a prank, right?

472
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:38,000
 That Marcus thought it was hilarious, right?

473
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,160
 But removing that, which is the most likely scenario, removing that we now have a doppelganger

474
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,040
 story where the doppelganger interacts in a positive way.

475
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,000
 I mean, not if you remember the power company, right?

476
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
 Eventually these kids might have got arrested.

477
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,280
 That was actually something that I thought was interesting.

478
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,920
 I went to go find out more about Ninetales.

479
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,440
 I started looking at their posting history.

480
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,560
 The last time they posted on Reddit, they're a pretty regular poster on a couple of different

481
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
 social medias.

482
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,080
 The last time they posted on Reddit was July 14th, 2022.

483
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
 August 18th was their last TikTok upload.

484
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They play a game called Wilderift.

485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 See, that's one of the things.

486
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,640
 Like when I go through these Reddit histories, when these stories seem so crazy, right?

487
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 So unbelievable.

488
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,800
 And if they're posting to nothing but paranormal stories, it doesn't mean it's not true, but

489
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,400
 it could more likely be made up.

490
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,040
 Because they're having nothing but world changing experiences over and over and over again.

491
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,360
 Like stuff you've never come across.

492
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
 I don't know.

493
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,560
 Okay, this guy's a good fiction writer, but that's not something we really want to cover

494
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
 on the show.

495
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,600
 Tony seems to be really into this game called Wilderift.

496
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
 I'm not for sure.

497
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,200
 Maybe it's like a MOBA where you run around like League of Legends and stuff like that.

498
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 Wilderift streamer.

499
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,880
 But the last time they updated TikTok, August 18th, Facebook is completely inactive.

500
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,480
 Their Discord invite completely invalid.

501
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,960
 I did try looking for this person.

502
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,360
 What happened was once I found out they hadn't posted for Reddit for a while and TikTok for

503
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,040
 a while, then I started going, hmm.

504
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,840
 So it's possible this person might just pop back up online tomorrow.

505
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,240
 I'm not going to check right now.

506
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,120
 I'm not going to keep investigating this young kid in the Philippines.

507
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,040
 I hope everything's okay, but who knows?

508
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,480
 It's very, very disturbing to have a doppelganger not just look like a relative or a loved one,

509
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,680
 but to actually turn around and interact with you.

510
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,080
 Gain trust, really, right?

511
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,920
 You thought you saw one of your relatives walking to the house in the back bedroom and

512
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
 you're like, oh, that's weird.

513
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,200
 A couple hours later, you go into the bedroom and the bedroom's empty.

514
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,800
 And then you found out they're out eating sushi at a restaurant.

515
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 That would be creepy, right?

516
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,920
 I'm not saying that's any less creepy.

517
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,140
 That would be disturbing.

518
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,280
 But it wasn't them.

519
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,480
 This one, this person acted like Marcus, spoke like Marcus, and gave helpful instructions.

520
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,040
 And to me, that's such an escalation.

521
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:15,000
 And so I think it would be easier to fall prey to an entity that was that lifelike.

522
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,280
 As opposed to you're like, oh, my brother is kind of weird.

523
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,880
 It doesn't normally walk around like a zombie, just go to bed and then disappear.

524
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
 But if it acted like your brother, and it talked like your brother, and you could give it

525
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,000
 noogies like your real brother, they're like, I'm keeping you around, you demon.

526
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,280
 He's like, oh, no, I manifested into the wrong thing.

527
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,720
 I'm just going to get bullied on earth.

528
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 Creepy story.

529
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,920
 And I am basically, basically am I imblying the reason why this guy hasn't gotten online

530
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,160
 recently is because he got tricked by a demon or got sucked into an alternate universe.

531
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,000
 Is that why I'm imblying?

532
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
 Kind of, right?

533
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,840
 I didn't think about this at the time, but it wouldn't make sense.

534
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,400
 Like his two brothers are so devout.

535
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,440
 What if Tony was the weak link spiritually in this household?

536
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,600
 There was a dark spirit that wanted to break the family.

537
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,760
 And it's like, I can't go into that church.

538
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,000
 That's kind of the rules, right?

539
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,560
 I can't go into the church.

540
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,520
 But if something happened to their little brother, would that make those two young men,

541
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,280
 would that make their faith waiver?

542
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:24,560
 The weak link in the family is the target.

543
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,600
 It's a story that is about paranoia.

544
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:35,640
 It's a story about diabolical forces imitating the people you love the most.

545
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,340
 And not just that, but being helpful.

546
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,120
 Helpful in the short term, maybe, but helpful.

547
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,400
 It's one of those stories that kind of makes us step back and go, who can you trust?

548
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,880
 If even the people who are closest to you can actually be demons in disguise, who can

549
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,400
 you trust?

550
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,160
 Now statistically, your family is your family, your friends are your friends, your coworkers

551
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,960
 are your coworkers, and there's no demonic involvement.

552
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:16,820
 But in the world of the paranormal, by the rules of the paranormal, sometimes it may be,

553
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
 right?

554
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:27,500
 And in Tony's case, it's possible that a demon assumed the form of his brother and gave him

555
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:38,600
 the gift of light, only to later trick Tony into following what he thought was one of

556
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:49,720
 his brothers, into a world of never ending darkness.
