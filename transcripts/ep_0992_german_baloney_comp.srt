1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 When a young woman walks into the emergency room, she perplexes the medical staff when

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,400
 she asks them, "Can you please help me?"

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
 With my third eye.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,920
 And then we take a look at two ghost stories that are so bizarre, you really have to ask

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:27,920
 yourself how weird can the world of the paranormal actually get today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun, living your best life.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,360
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
 Everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause for Micah.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,880
 Woohoo!

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
 Yeah! Come on in Micah!

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,560
 Do a little, do the splits!

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
 Do the splits!

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
 That'll make sense by the end of the episode, it won't.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
 These ghost stories are so bizarre but Micah, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
 You guys can't support the show through the Patreon, that's totally fine.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,400
 It really is.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,520
 Micah, let's go ahead and get started here.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,760
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,440
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,400
 Drive us all the way out to a house in the middle of the suburbs.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,800
 A nice leisurely drive before we get this insanity-laden episode ready.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,840
 And I gotta give a shout out to Dead Rabbit Radio Listener Cloud District Dweller.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,640
 They're the ones who posted this on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,480
 This story is so weird, thank you so much for sending that over to me.

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,200
 It's November 12th, 2022.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,720
 It's a pretty recent.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
 We're headed out to the suburbs.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
 This is one of those stories where we don't know where it takes place.

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,840
 It was posted online by someone going by the handle of Oolahdee Da, Mr. Frenchman.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
 We're gonna go ahead and call her Jerry.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,920
 And Jerry is a 21-year-old woman and she's having a medical problem.

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,200
 She's posting this online.

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
 She's on this subreddit called Ask Docs.

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,240
 And apparently they do like try to verify who actually is a doctor,

42
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
 so some weirdo can't show up and be like,

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,160
 "Oh, just expose your anus to sunlight.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
 That'll heal all of your wounds."

45
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
 The subreddit apparently does verify whether or not people are doctors.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
 I don't know how.

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
 I don't know how.

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
 I just send in the pictures of diplomas.

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,800
 Who knows?

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,600
 But it was Ask Docs is where you can post and get medical advice

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
 for free, basically.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,320
 So that's where Jerry is at right now.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
 She's posting in the Ask Docs subreddit.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,080
 She's 21 years old.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
 And she has a problem that I would say that most medical staff has never had to deal with.

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,760
 She goes the other day, started to realize something.

57
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,200
 My eyes are starting to merge into one eye in the middle of my head.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
 Now, while that may be cool to you or me,

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,440
 maybe not cool if it's happening to you.

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
 What if we saw it happening to someone we knew?

61
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
 We'd be like, "Whoa, dude, I bet you that's really awesome."

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
 They're like, "No, no, it's not.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,920
 It's not.

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,400
 I have no depth perception and I have a tennis match later."

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
 Sounds cool, though.

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
 I'm sure there are some advantages to just having one eyeball in the middle of your head.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
 I can't think of any.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
 I can't think of any off the top of my head.

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 But she says, "My eyeballs are merging together to form one eyeball in the middle."

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
 And I can actually feel the pressure.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 Like, you might think that I'm just hallucinating.

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
 I don't know where you could be getting that idea, but

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,840
 I can actually feel the pressure right in my, where my nose hits my forehead.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
 It feels like there's some sort of pressure or buildup right there.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 And I know there's an eyeball growing in the middle,

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240
 growing right in the middle of my head.

77
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,120
 However, what's odd is that my two eyeballs are still where they're supposed to be.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
 Like, I can look in the mirror and see that I have two eyes.

79
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
 And when I look in the mirror, I don't even see the third eye in the middle of my forehead.

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,320
 I don't see it when I look in a mirror, but I know that it's there.

81
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,840
 And my two regular eyeballs, while they appear to still be in their normal place,

82
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,960
 they're actually dying.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,320
 Those eyeballs are starting to decay and rot.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
 And I notice that no one else around me is reacting to the fact that

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
 I'm growing this third eye in the middle of my head.

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,120
 So I can only surmise that they don't notice it either.

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,960
 Now, I don't want to ask them, "Hey, what's going on in the middle of my head?"

88
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
 Because it'll just freak them out.

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
 It'll just freak them out.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,280
 And they can't see it anyways, and they'll probably think I'm crazy.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
 And I'm not.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
 I'm not crazy.

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,320
 But my regular eyeballs are dying and a third eyeball is growing

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,440
 right in the middle of my head.

95
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 And to put some more pumpkin pie on the table, she goes, "While I can't see it in the mirror,

96
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,760
 and no one else can see it, when I look at it, as I try to focus into the middle of my head,

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,680
 where the pressure is building, with my two dying eyes, I can see the third eye starting to form.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,920
 So I can see it with my eyes, but not in a mirror.

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,000
 No one else can see it."

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
 I wonder if she had taken any photographs, done any TikTok videos,

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
 accidentally left a filter on.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
 She's like, "Ah, not only do I have a third eye, but it's snowing too."

103
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,160
 Now, she does state, she goes, "And I think this is kind of normal for what they do on ask docs,

104
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
 because a lot of times when you go to the doctor in real life,

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
 they always ask what type of medication you're on right now.

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,160
 So, you know, like I go to the doctor, I go, "Well, I take Tylenol, and I take ibuprofen,

107
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
 and then I have like my beta blockers."

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,200
 You know, I kind of list it off.

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,520
 So if I have something, they can maybe say, "Oh, it's a side effect of this."

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
 It's a side effect of that.

111
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,880
 When she starts off this thing, when she's on ask docs, she does list the medication that she's on.

112
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,520
 She's prescribed Vinae's, which is a drug that treats ADHD.

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 And she's also on a drug called Cerroquil.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,200
 Well, again, she's not on the drug Cerroquil.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,960
 She was prescribed the drug Cerroquil, but she goes, "I'm not taking those anymore.

116
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
 I don't need them."

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,320
 But I'm glad she listed them.

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,680
 I wasn't familiar with those.

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
 I thought Vinae's was actually for sinus pressure.

120
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
 She's like, "My allergies have been really bad.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,560
 I get this big sinus buildup in the middle of my forehead,

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
 but I stopped taking my Vinae's, and now I think there's a third eye growing."

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
 Vinae's isn't for sinus pressure.

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
 It's actually for ADHD.

125
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,440
 Cerroquil, which she's also stopped taking, and some of you guys may know this,

126
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,080
 it's used for schizophrenia.

127
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,320
 It's also used to treat bipolar disorder, manic episodes, things like that.

128
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:29,040
 So now she's told us that she's not taking medication that is most likely causing her to hallucinate.

129
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,080
 By dropping this medication, I guess one of the side effects, because people immediately,

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
 it was interesting to read how people were reacting to this young woman.

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
 You had basically two, three groups of people.

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
 Some of them seemed like she was faking.

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,880
 She was just faking.

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,720
 She was making it up for karma points.

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,640
 Other people were trying to trick her, and this is actually a good technique for someone

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,800
 who's most likely having a manic episode, to go to the emergency room.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,240
 They go, "Oh, that actually can happen."

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
 And the doctor, if you go to the emergency room right now, they can help you with that.

139
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 That's pretty common.

140
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
 I'm actually typing this out with the third eye right now.

141
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,480
 That's pretty common.

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,880
 Go to the emergency room and tell them everything you told us, and they'll take care of you.

143
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,280
 You saw multiple comments like that, and Jerry kept responding, "Oh, thanks, yeah, that's good advice."

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,560
 A lot of people are like, "Just go to the emergency room, and they'll take care of you."

145
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,160
 And that's where I learned, as I was reading through the comments, that's where I kind of

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,640
 learned what cerakoyl was, and then I had to go research it.

147
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,800
 When you stop taking cerakoyl, it can cause hallucinations, and it's most likely

148
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,360
 she was having some sinus pressure buildup, because she wasn't taking the vinae's anymore.

149
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 Great for sinus pressure as well.

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
 She was starting to have sinus pressure buildup, and she began to hallucinate.

151
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,880
 She had a real-world symptom, which was that pain in the middle of her forehead.

152
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,440
 She began to think an eyeball was popping out of her head.

153
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,120
 And on the one hand, it's a fairly routine psychotic episode.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,200
 Someone who's supposed to be on medication and stopped taking it, and by stopped taking it,

155
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
 can cause hallucinations.

156
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
 Thanks to have a third eye growing out of their forehead.

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,840
 And she hasn't posted anything since, and she did say that she was going to go to the doctor,

158
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,720
 and hopefully she did.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
 Hopefully she got this taken care of.

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,840
 It's a pretty routine medical thing, right?

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,400
 People do have these types of episodes from time to time.

162
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,480
 But in the world of the paranormal, in the world of conspiracy theory,

163
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,480
 it's definitely- I mean, I'm not- first off, I'm not going to say that maybe it was a ghost

164
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,840
 giving her a third eye.

165
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,680
 I'm not going to say that maybe the Illuminati was ready to expose the nobody once and for all,

166
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
 and she was assuming her final form.

167
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
 I'm not saying that.

168
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,240
 What I'm saying is that it is- this is- because it was a real event to this person.

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,560
 And have this person not had- and I- you guys know how much I hate Reddit, but have this person

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
 not had access to Reddit.

171
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,360
 Have this person not gone here to find information?

172
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
 Who knows what could have happened?

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
 She could have said, "Well, these eyes are dying.

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,560
 I need to get them out of me.

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,320
 I need to get these dead eyes out of me."

176
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
 And then she scoops them out with a lemon ball or something like that.

177
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
 Oh, I have the most gruesome example she could have just been like, "I don't know what this is.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
 I go to the doctor."

179
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,600
 But, you know, she could have done something super extreme because she's having this psychotic episode.

180
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,160
 And there is as much as paranormal researchers like myself and paranormal aficionados,

181
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,400
 people who just enjoy these stories, we have to admit there is a big dose of crazy in our world.

182
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,720
 There's not a lot of lunatics running around the astrophysicist lab.

183
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,840
 There's not a lot of cuckoos who study math or history or any of these other

184
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 sciences, any of these other pursuits of knowledge.

185
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,800
 We get a lot of nut jobs.

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,520
 It doesn't mean everyone who believes in this stuff is a nut job.

187
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,480
 But we do get, I think there is a big, I do think there's a bigger crossover than, say, rocket science.

188
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,520
 Or even like sports history.

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,480
 It doesn't even have to be suit something super important like science.

190
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,880
 Just people who want to sit around and talk about whether or not the panthers are going to beat the bangles.

191
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
 Not talking about in the jungle.

192
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,880
 Not talking about that gauge match they've arranged with all their exotic animals.

193
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,600
 I think there are less lunatics in other pursuits than ours.

194
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,080
 And so we do have that crossover.

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,040
 And I think what happens is you get people, I think if you had, if Jerry was having this psychotic episode,

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,720
 also believed in conspiracy thing, cut in conspiracy theories like the nobody,

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,240
 this idea that there is one person on earth right now who is destined to destroy the Illuminati,

198
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
 that wouldn't, this story would have ended much, much worse.

199
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,800
 I know I keep bringing it up, but I think it's a perfect example as grim as it is.

200
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,440
 As how these things can collide, there was that man who was suffering a serious mental delusion.

201
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,680
 I know a bunch of people are getting ready to fast forward 30 seconds as I talk about this.

202
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
 They hate being reminded of it.

203
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
 Just recently, I think it was earlier this year, this guy was suffering this horrible

204
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,880
 delusion about reptilians taking over the world that he kidnapped his own two daughters

205
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,560
 and very, very young girls and drove them to Mexico and executed them both with a spear gun.

206
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,880
 Because they are half reptilian and if he let them live, they were going to put the planet in jeopardy.

207
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
 Now he's definitely mentally ill.

208
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,040
 Definitely mentally ill, but if he was a big 49ers fan instead,

209
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,880
 and he loved watching football every weekend and didn't believe any of this conspiracy stuff,

210
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,160
 I don't know, maybe he still would have killed his kids, I don't mean to be laughing about it.

211
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
 I don't think so, I don't think he would have.

212
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
 I think his mental illness still would have been there,

213
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,960
 but I think it would have presented itself in another way.

214
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,920
 He would have been like, "The game's rigged, the game's rigged, it's all rigged, the whole society's rigged," stuff like that.

215
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,760
 But when your conspiracy theory is it's us against them, the reptilians are slowly taking over the planet.

216
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
 Like, you see what I mean?

217
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
 No, I'm not saying this to badmouth conspiracy theories at all.

218
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
 I'm not even saying this to badmouth the reptilian conspiracy theory at all.

219
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,240
 I'm just saying that this is something that we have to deal with,

220
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,440
 and not like deal with as far as like we have to set up rules or anything like that.

221
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,560
 This is something that is just part and parcel of the world of the paranormal, unfortunately.

222
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,400
 Again, I think they're in the minority.

223
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,960
 I think the violent paranormal believers, outside of being impolter guys,

224
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,920
 and the violent conspiracy theorists, I think they're the small minority of the group, but

225
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,040
 it's just interesting to look at all of these different moving pieces and how this would work.

226
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,400
 And again, it was so interesting thinking about delusions, thinking about mental illness.

227
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,360
 I bought this gold chain, quote unquote, it was a piece of junk.

228
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,040
 I bought this gold dookie chain, it was like this old hip-hop chain from a

229
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,160
 outlet from a jewelry store called Bling Cartel.

230
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,280
 And here's a little tip.

231
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,880
 Don't ever buy jewelry when their L's and their name are replaced by guns on their web design.

232
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,680
 I went to Bling Cartel and I bought this piece of junk jewelry,

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,560
 and now I'm having a, I send it back, I go, this is junk, I want my money back.

234
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,480
 I want my thousands of dollars back, no, it's just like 80 bucks, right?

235
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
 I bought it on the Lark, but it was about as heavy as a Christmas ornament.

236
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,560
 I'm like, this is a piece of junk.

237
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,000
 I sent it back to him and said, I want my money back, you know, whatever, 80 bucks.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
 It cost me 12 bucks to ship it back to him.

239
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,600
 I want my money back.

240
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
 They're not talking to me anymore.

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,760
 They're not responding to any of my emails or anything like that.

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,160
 So now I got to do a charge back from my credit card company.

243
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,720
 The reason why I'm bringing this up, I'm not bringing this up because I want to have a rise

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,320
 up against Bling Cartel, whatever, whatever, I'll get my money back one way or the other,

245
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
 because right now I'm doing a charge back on my credit card.

246
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,120
 And so I got to get the receipt of when I went down to the post office to mail this back to Bling,

247
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,640
 mail this back to the Bling Cartel.

248
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
 I can't find the receipt right now.

249
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,880
 I hope this episode doesn't come out before the charge back, because then they're like,

250
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,520
 "Oh, if he doesn't have the receipt, we're not going to move his money back."

251
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
 I'm trying to find the receipt from the post office.

252
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,800
 I went down about some stamps to mail out my Patreon stickers, Patreon supporter stickers.

253
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
 I can't find my receipt.

254
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
 I'm looking all over, I'm looking all over.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,640
 I can't find it.

256
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,800
 And in an instant, I had a thought.

257
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
 My first thought was don't buy stuff from a place called Bling Cartel.

258
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
 But secondly, I had a thought for an instant.

259
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,120
 You know, my friend Sabine, she comes over all the time, and I don't know that it's so interesting.

260
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
 As I was looking for this receipt, I couldn't find it.

261
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,760
 I thought, "What if Sabine threw it away?"

262
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,600
 Not on accident.

263
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
 Split second, this thought popped in my head.

264
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
 "What if Sabine is working for the Bling Cartel?"

265
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
 What if I'm serious?

266
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
 This popped in my head for a split second.

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,080
 "What if Sabine is working for the Bling Cartel, and she threw the receipt away?"

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,160
 And in another second, like I had that thought, it popped in my head, and then I go, "That's dumb.

269
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,160
 That's like the dumbest possible thing you could think of."

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
 And I continue to look for my receipt.

271
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,400
 But here's the thing.

272
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,920
 If you have a mental illness, that thought could have spiraled out of control.

273
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,000
 You know what I mean?

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,880
 If I was in the beginnings or the middle of a psychotic episode,

275
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,840
 that I would start to see all these connections between her.

276
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,520
 I see she starts spelling her name with little guns for letters.

277
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
 She's suddenly wearing a lot of bling everywhere.

278
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
 I would have started to make connections that weren't there.

279
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,840
 I could connect a missing receipt that I need to get my $80 back,

280
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,080
 and then someone being here, and it go missing, and she's part of it.

281
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,360
 That's how this happens.

282
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,000
 Now, because I'm not in a psychotic episode, I immediately dismissed it as a thought.

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,600
 If I started to have sinus buildup, and I woke up in the morning, and I felt this intense pressure

284
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,720
 where my nose hits my skull, I might have a quick thought.

285
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
 Be like, "What if that's a third eye growing in my head?"

286
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
 But I would immediately go, "Oh, that's not what it is."

287
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,240
 The mucinex mucus ball visited you last night.

288
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,720
 So yeah, it's just an interesting look at, and everyone has insane thoughts.

289
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
 Everybody has insane thoughts all the time.

290
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,040
 We all do, but we're able to regulate them.

291
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,960
 We're able to go, "No, I don't want to beat that person to death with a baseball bat."

292
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
 I'm sitting next to them on the couch, and I see my baseball bat over there,

293
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,160
 and you go, "I wonder what would happen right now if I grabbed this bat and started hitting them in the face."

294
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,640
 And then you go, "I want to do that. I want to do that."

295
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
 Your eyes shift from side to side, you look over.

296
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
 The person sitting next to you has a giant baseball forehead.

297
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,720
 You know what I mean?

298
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,440
 We all have that.

299
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
 Sometimes they become intrusive thoughts.

300
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
 We did a whole episode on that where you start to become afraid

301
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
 that you're going to hurt those you love.

302
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,160
 You start to really like, "Why am I having these thoughts?

303
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
 Why am I thinking about beating people to death with a baseball bat?"

304
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,880
 It's just weird how the human brain works, and when it works, it works.

305
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,400
 Even when it's having an intrusive thought, that's just part of having a human psyche.

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,240
 When it doesn't work, when something is dangerously wrong with it,

307
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,880
 you can't just shrug off the thing and be like,

308
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
 "I'm not really going to beat him to death with a baseball bat."

309
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,360
 I would never really hurt my family.

310
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,680
 Like, even though you might have an intrusive thought,

311
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
 "You're afraid you might hurt your family?"

312
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,560
 You're like, "I don't know why I'm having these."

313
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,360
 And if you can even ask, "Why am I having these?

314
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
 What's wrong with me?"

315
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
 Those are signs that you're mentally well.

316
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's when you look at your kids and go, "They're reptilians."

317
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
 And you don't even try to get out of that intrusive thought.

318
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
 You see it as a truth.

319
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,680
 It's not about not wanting to hurt your kids.

320
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,600
 It's about how and where you can hurt your kids to get away with it

321
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
 and continue destroying the reptilian agenda.

322
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,800
 That's the difference between the mental illness and the mentally well.

323
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,120
 There are a lot of people who believe in the reptilian theory.

324
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,920
 That is a huge component of the conspiracy theory and the UFO world.

325
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,080
 And a lot of them will go to war with the reptilians.

326
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
 And they'll talk openly about it.

327
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
 But they don't.

328
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,840
 They may even talk openly about reptilians assuming human form.

329
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,280
 And what would you do?

330
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,560
 What would you do if I got my hands around the corpse of the Queen of England

331
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,320
 and exposed her to the world?

332
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040
 But then they're not actually going to go out in the streets

333
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,840
 and start shooting people.

334
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
 And they're definitely not going to shoot their own family members.

335
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,680
 It's weird, right?

336
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,040
 Isn't that weird to think about?

337
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,400
 There's a lot of people who believe in the reptilian agenda

338
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
 and that they're taking over the world and they truly are alien.

339
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,840
 But if you ask them, if you put a shotgun in their hands

340
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,680
 and said, "We need to go down and take these guys out,"

341
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,920
 they'd be like, "What in the world are you talking about?"

342
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,240
 I'm not.

343
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,360
 Yeah, I believe in the alien agenda,

344
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,520
 but I'm not going to go on a shooting spree.

345
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,080
 Super fascinating because they're still mentally well.

346
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,680
 They may believe something.

347
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,360
 They may believe in something you may not believe in.

348
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
 They may not believe in something that most people don't believe in.

349
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,800
 But they're not murderers.

350
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,560
 They're not mentally sick people.

351
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,760
 They just have a different view of the world.

352
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,160
 I guess if you do think that there's much of reptilian chimp,

353
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,960
 chimp, chimp, I wouldn't say you're insane if you did that.

354
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,560
 I would not say that.

355
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,360
 I don't think you're insane, but I do believe myself.

356
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
 I do believe in a lot of insane stuff.

357
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,640
 So I don't know if that's comforting either.

358
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,160
 I was like, "I'm on your side.

359
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,480
 I don't really agree that the Queen of England's a reptile,

360
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
 but don't worry, buddy.

361
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,320
 I got you."

362
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 And then you listen to this next segment.

363
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 This next segment is so bizarre.

364
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
 It's even weirder than a bunch of reptilians.

365
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
 I wonder if the one of the Queen of England died,

366
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
 if she was a reptilian, did they just bury her skin?

367
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,160
 Like, did it just shut off the skin like a snake does?

368
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,080
 And now it's a bigger, stronger Queen Elizabeth somewhere out there?

369
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
 Like, if you went to her guy, people in Britain,

370
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,280
 listeners in Britain, dig up her grave and tell me if it's just her loose skin.

371
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,680
 Let's find out once and for all.

372
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,720
 Michael, let's go ahead before I try to encourage my listeners

373
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,160
 to cause any other random acts of grave desiccation.

374
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,480
 Yeah, is that the word desiccation?

375
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,600
 Oh, that means dried out.

376
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,560
 Desecration, that's what I meant.

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,120
 Michael, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys of the carbon helicopter.

378
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
 We're leaving behind this emergency room.

379
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,000
 We're waving goodbye to Jerry.

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
 He really hopes she got the help that she needs.

381
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,560
 Fly us all the way out to California.

382
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,920
 Long time listeners of the show know

383
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,760
 I'm a dedicated ghost guy.

384
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,720
 I love ghosts.

385
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,320
 I'd like to say it's my favorite paranormal subject.

386
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,120
 That might be true.

387
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,800
 That might be true.

388
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,080
 There's so many good ones out there, right?

389
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:40,080
 I definitely like ghosts and like alternate realities, portals, things like that.

390
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,640
 I think I like those more than Bigfoot or UFOs,

391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,120
 but I like Bigfoot and UFOs more than pretty much any other topic.

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
 But I'm a big fan of ghosts.

393
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
 Personally, I had a lot of ghost adventures.

394
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,040
 I've seen a lot of ghost stuff.

395
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,720
 I've seen a couple of demons.

396
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,520
 I like all that stuff.

397
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,720
 So I spent a good amount of my time,

398
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,600
 probably too much of my time, on theshadowlands.net.

399
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,640
 And I actually found this relatively late in life.

400
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,760
 Like really, what was it this year when I really started going through it?

401
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,560
 Four years into a paranormal podcast.

402
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,240
 So I was like, wow, this is cool.

403
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
 I think I knew about it back in the past.

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
 But it's been a lot of time on theshadowlands.net.

405
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,800
 Just reading all these random ghost stories and 90% of them are,

406
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,640
 here's a bed and breakfast.

407
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,480
 And sometimes in room 29, you can tell how excited I am.

408
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,920
 This is the funniest thing, as much as I love ghosts.

409
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,240
 I hate boring ghost stories.

410
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
 Like if I was in room 29 and I woke up in the middle of the night,

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,360
 there was a translucent woman standing at the foot of my bed.

412
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
 I couldn't wait to tell you guys about it.

413
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,800
 I'd be like, well, you guys won't believe what happened.

414
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,720
 But it's not happening to me.

415
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
 I'm sitting there reading about someone else seeing this ghost.

416
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,720
 And I guess it's still exciting, but it's so common in the world of ghostology.

417
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
 Such a common, you wake up.

418
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,840
 I mean, I can't even pretend to be enthused about this.

419
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,440
 About this.

420
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
 When I wake up in the middle of the night,

421
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,920
 you hear the sound of a butler preparing pancakes or what have you.

422
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
 A lot of it's that.

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,920
 A lot of it's that.

424
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,600
 And again, if it's happening to you, it's the most exciting ghost story in the world.

425
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,320
 I get it.

426
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
 It would be the most exciting ghost story in the world if it was happening to me.

427
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,000
 But when you're reading about it, I mean, I loved that stuff when I was younger,

428
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,160
 but I get maybe because I've read so much of them, they just seem wrote.

429
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
 And I say it's the most common.

430
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,280
 Ghost sightings are still very rare.

431
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,760
 You see more squirrels.

432
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,360
 You see more ducks than you will see ghosts.

433
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,280
 Until until my ghostinator is finally complete, then we'll see what they have to say.

434
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,640
 But we're reading all these stories.

435
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,840
 Now we find really cool stuff to talk about on this show.

436
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
 Really creepy ghost encounters.

437
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,920
 Things that are incredibly weird.

438
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,360
 Even in the world of the paranormal stuff when you're like, that's so bizarre.

439
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 The two stories we're about to cover are beyond the pale.

440
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,960
 These might be two of the weirdest ghost stories that I've come across.

441
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,360
 Yet they're so simple in a way.

442
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,560
 Very short.

443
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,960
 And both of these stories I've done additional research on.

444
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,760
 There's no other source on the internet that mentions anything about these.

445
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,160
 So they're going to easily be fake.

446
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,960
 They could be fake because they're so abnormal.

447
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
 They fall so far.

448
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,360
 Outside what even the world of the paranormal normally has that you go, is this made up?

449
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,160
 One of my favorite UFO stories, and we covered it on the podcast a long time ago, is the

450
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,360
 alien invasion of Casablanca.

451
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,560
 It was a residential neighborhood where the kids of the neighborhood had to fight off

452
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,160
 multi-dimensional aliens.

453
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,760
 It's one of my favorite stories.

454
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,160
 It is so weird.

455
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
 I'll put it in the show notes.

456
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
 It's just so weird.

457
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
 And even that had multiple accounts.

458
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,160
 I was able to find different resources on that particular event.

459
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,360
 But I believe that one happened.

460
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
 I do believe that that happened.

461
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
 So just because it is so weird doesn't mean that it's impossible.

462
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
 Let's take a look at these stories and we'll find out.

463
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
 I might be hyping it up too much too.

464
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,360
 You go, Jason, that's not so weird.

465
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 That's totally normal.

466
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 As you're blinking your third eye, totally normal.

467
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
 Let's take a look at this.

468
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
 We're in Redwood City, California.

469
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
 There's a place called Canada College.

470
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 Confusing.

471
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,360
 Jason, not really.

472
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 I'm really confusing.

473
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
 I don't think anyone who goes to Canada College is like, "Oh, no, I'm in Canada now.

474
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 Where's all my loonies?

475
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
 I need to have real money."

476
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
 No, it's just a place called Canada College.

477
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 I wonder what Canada means.

478
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,360
 Like, is it a word that means something else like duck?

479
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 And so like you could have like Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada,

480
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada

481
00:27:36,360 --> 00:28:06,360
 Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada

482
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
 but it really kills your nostrils.

483
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
 You're like, "Yes, the legends are true.

484
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
 The ghost story is real."

485
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,360
 That was totally worth a half hour riding up and down an elevator.

486
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 I would, that's the end of that ghost story.

487
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
 That's not all.

488
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 It's not all.

489
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
 I got more.

490
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
 But that's the end of that one.

491
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,360
 I would, this would be something that I would love to do.

492
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 I would love to do this.

493
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
 I'm the laziest ghost center ever.

494
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,360
 I was like, "Do you have any ghost stories where I could just stand in one place and I go up and down?

495
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
 I don't want to walk?

496
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
 I don't want to walk around your campus.

497
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
 I want a ghost story.

498
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
 Maybe I could even take a chair into the elevator.

499
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
 What are you talking about?

500
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
 This is right up my alley.

501
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 It's a ghost, it's a ghost hunch you don't have to move for.

502
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,360
 We go in this elevator and I went 15, you smell dead dog.

503
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
 It's funny.

504
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
 We did an episode a long time ago.

505
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,360
 Again, a totally weird haunting.

506
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 It was a vet's office.

507
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,360
 They would smell the wettest dog fart in this office.

508
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
 There would be no dog around.

509
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 It would just smell like a dog just laid one out right in front of you.

510
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
 Wet and moist.

511
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:26,360
 And in that story, we said that at one point this woman was standing there and the mysterious dog fart actually, like, her hair moved.

512
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
 As if someone really farted right in her face.

513
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 Like, there was a force behind the gust of air.

514
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 It's funny also when I recorded it, I'm not recording the haunted closet anymore.

515
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,360
 Not because it's too spooky or anything, just because I think it's easier for me to record out here right now.

516
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:50,360
 Whenever I talk about dogs in the haunted closet, I've reported seeing dog paws walking outside my door.

517
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
 So we'll see if that happens at night.

518
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 We'll see if I'm in bed and a dog jumps up on bed.

519
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 We'll say this, I'd much rather see dog feet outside of my haunted closet door than smell a dog fart.

520
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
 But first time listeners are like, "What in the world are you talking about?"

521
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
 "What about all these episodes in the show notes?"

522
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,360
 You're like, "What? This guy is crazier than the first woman he covered on his show."

523
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 Anyways, I'll report any dog related assaults in a future episode.

524
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
 Elevator.

525
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
 Smell of a dead dog at 1.15pm.

526
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
 Nobody knows why this happens.

527
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,360
 There's one report on the internet about this.

528
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,360
 However, also at Canada College, we want to go out there just for a smelly dead dog.

529
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 Also out in Canada College, we're leaving behind the elevator.

530
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
 I've kept you trapped in there.

531
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,360
 I'm like, "Breathe it in. Breathe in the proof of the paranormal."

532
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
 We're leaving. We're getting kicked out most likely.

533
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 We're headed at a learning center.

534
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,360
 Apparently also at Canada College in the parking lot,

535
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,360
 if you walk out to the parking lot at Canada College,

536
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,360
 and they don't give a specific time frame, it's not like at 1.17pm,

537
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
 you have to run from the elevator to the parking lot,

538
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:08,360
 you can see a, apparently a realistic looking person.

539
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,360
 It doesn't say that this was like a see-through ghost.

540
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
 It didn't say that it was slime or something like that.

541
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:21,360
 You see a naked man standing in the parking lot.

542
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 And then he does the splits.

543
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,360
 And then he disappears.

544
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,360
 Not a get-together-and-runs-away-before-gambus police shows up.

545
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
 He vanishes.

546
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
 You're in the parking lot.

547
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
 You see a fully nude man doing the splits,

548
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,360
 and it vanishes right before your eyes.

549
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
 What?

550
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,360
 I mean, think about what we think of the world of paranormal.

551
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 How does this fit any of those?

552
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,360
 Did it give way to say how did he die?

553
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,360
 Well, I can say doing the splits in the middle of the parking lot

554
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 probably is a pretty easy way to die.

555
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
 No one's going to expect it.

556
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
 Someone's driving a big rig.

557
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 They're going to run right over you.

558
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 They're not going to see you.

559
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
 And I don't see you doing the splits.

560
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
 So I guess it's possible that he died doing what he loves to do,

561
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
 he naked splits in the parking lot.

562
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,360
 I also thought, was this possibly like some sort of shamanistic/hippy ceremony?

563
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,360
 And some guy loved doing the splits so much there

564
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,360
 that he infused the area with his essence?

565
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
 I have no idea.

566
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 Also, now that I think about doing the splits in the parking lot,

567
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,360
 it would be so hot.

568
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 Not sexy hot.

569
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,360
 I'm saying like, if you-- I'm all the way-- ooh.

570
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,360
 Man, let's come back to this haunting tomorrow.

571
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
 You're like, no, Jason.

572
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
 If you were naked doing the splits on the hot sidewalk,

573
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,360
 that's how he became a ghost.

574
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
 He's like, ah, he's burning.

575
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
 Some guy's cracking eggs next to him,

576
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
 making the eggs come the sidewalk as well.

577
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,360
 Absolutely bizarre.

578
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,360
 I read that and there's no other information online about that.

579
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
 Trust me, I tried.

580
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
 I tried.

581
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
 Insane.

582
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
 That's insane.

583
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,360
 And you go, Jason, someone had clearly made that up.

584
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,360
 Canada College is a fine institution.

585
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
 Right now the dean is writing me an email.

586
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,360
 He's like, dear sir, I do work for the Bling cartel.

587
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
 We're coming for you.

588
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 How dare you have smirked the name of Canada College

589
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,360
 and the Blingiest Cartel around?

590
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
 It sounds-- it's made up.

591
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,360
 In the world of paranormal, it actually is really hard to tell.

592
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
 There's so much weirdness, but we're just getting started.

593
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
 We've got one more place to visit, Micah.

594
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,360
 If you'll let that carbon or copter and get ready to take off again,

595
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,360
 we're headed all the way out to Connecticut.

596
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,360
 [imitates car engine]

597
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
 We're headed out to Connecticut.

598
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,360
 Specifically, there's a town called Mariden.

599
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,360
 And in Mariden, there once was a store called Town and Country Market.

600
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,360
 And when I say once was a place, like it used to have a--

601
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 we're not talking old-timey.

602
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,360
 It was like a Google review website.

603
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 It was opened until fairly recently.

604
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,360
 I don't know if COVID closed it down.

605
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,360
 I don't know if too many people ate the baloney at this place,

606
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
 because that will also cause it to get closed down.

607
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
 We'll talk about that in a second.

608
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
 But Town and Country Market-- I mean, there's photographs of it.

609
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
 It's a real building that's been there for a long time.

610
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
 But you can check it out, Town and Country Market.

611
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
 Although be careful.

612
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,360
 Those are true.

613
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,360
 If this is true, this should be the only place ghost hunters ever visit.

614
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
 Well, okay, maybe not.

615
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
 That would be telling the geologists,

616
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 "Only go to the Grand Canyon, dude.

617
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 That's the best place around."

618
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,360
 I guess you can go other places, but this is just so bizarre.

619
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,360
 Town and Country Market.

620
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
 There is the ghost--

621
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,360
 reportedly, the ghost of Old Man Ronnie,

622
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,360
 who was a butcher, worked at Town and Country Market,

623
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,360
 had his little hatchet chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop,

624
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
 chopping up the meat.

625
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,360
 Well, one day, he got impaled by a meat hook.

626
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
 I don't know if he was murdered.

627
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,360
 I don't know if he just backed up into it.

628
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 He's like, "Ahh!"

629
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 But he got impaled by a meat hook,

630
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,360
 so now you can sometimes see Old Man Ronnie

631
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 still walking around the Town and Country Market

632
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,360
 in a bloodied apron.

633
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 That's not too bad, right?

634
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
 I mean, I guess if you're one of Ronnie's friends and family,

635
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 that's horrible, but you know,

636
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 actually, that would be quite terrifying

637
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 if he goes draped in blood,

638
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 whether it's his blood or the blood of meat.

639
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
 It wouldn't matter.

640
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
 That would be terrifying.

641
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
 If you woke him in the middle of the night at a bed and breakfast,

642
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
 and there was a bloody butcher standing out of the foot of your bed,

643
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,360
 that would be absolutely terrifying.

644
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
 You couldn't just wave it off and go,

645
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 "I'm gonna go back to sleep."

646
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
 But that's not all.

647
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 That's really not all.

648
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 There's also items that would fly off the shelves,

649
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,360
 not because the sales were so good,

650
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
 but poltergeist activity.

651
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
 So now we have a bloodied butcher walking around.

652
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 We have poltergeist activity.

653
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,360
 Fairly interesting stuff, but that's not why we're here.

654
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 According to this report,

655
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,360
 you're at Town and Country Market,

656
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
 you're doing grocery shopping.

657
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
 Everything's fine.

658
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
 You did walk down the aisle,

659
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,360
 and a bunch of stuff was flying off the aisle in you in the hedge.

660
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
 You're like, "Oh, yeah, you know, the deal here is so good.

661
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 It's worth getting concussed by a can of tuna."

662
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,360
 People have reported while they're at Town and Country Market

663
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:58,360
 to begin to have their minds flooded with the images of angry cows.

664
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 You're like, "Jayson, just stop.

665
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,360
 Just stop before you ruin your reputation.

666
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,360
 Don't finish this."

667
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
 This is so awesome.

668
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
 I love this story.

669
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
 I couldn't find anything else on it.

670
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,360
 So it may just be totally made up.

671
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,360
 It could have been a rival market trying to shut them down.

672
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
 You walk into Town and Country Market,

673
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,360
 you will become overwhelmed with the sights.

674
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 You'll have these visions of angry cows trying to find their bodies.

675
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,360
 Because they've been butchered in the back.

676
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,360
 You'll actually see like a skeletal cow,

677
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
 and it'll be picking up hamburgers off the ground

678
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
 and stuffing them into his bones,

679
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,360
 and being like, "Make me whole once more."

680
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
 It doesn't actually include dialogue.

681
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
 It doesn't include dialogue.

682
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
 It doesn't mention hamburgers.

683
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,360
 I just imagine that.

684
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
 How would the visions be?

685
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
 What it says it goes,

686
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,360
 "Images of angry cows looking for the rest of their once full body."

687
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 So it could have been something like that.

688
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
 They could have been stuffing ground hamburger

689
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
 into their loose-hanging skin and going,

690
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
 "You did this. You did this."

691
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,360
 Is there trying to reform their body?

692
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,360
 You could just be a picture of a cow head

693
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
 floating around in your psyche going,

694
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,360
 "I was so whole cow.

695
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,360
 I don't know exactly what the visions are."

696
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,360
 But if you went to Town and Country Market,

697
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
 maybe if you go there today,

698
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
 I think the building's still there.

699
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
 At least that's what it looks like.

700
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 Tell us what the madness of the cows look like.

701
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 Tell us what you see.

702
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
 The visions of these angry cows,

703
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
 because their bodies were chopped up.

704
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,360
 It's not even the craziest thing here.

705
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,360
 Also, if you go to the old meat room,

706
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,360
 you will hear cows.

707
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,360
 But not mooing.

708
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 Apparently, these cows had voice boxes,

709
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:03,360
 and they're talking to you.

710
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,360
 It doesn't say what they say.

711
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
 They could say,

712
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
 "Why did you turn me into a hamburger?

713
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
 Why are you eating me every single day?"

714
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
 It just says that the old meat room

715
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,360
 was haunted by cows with voice boxes.

716
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,360
 So I'm wondering if they're still just saying moo,

717
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,360
 but it sounds like electronic,

718
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
 because they have a voice box.

719
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
 Or if they're actually talking,

720
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
 that's the part you're going to be stunned.

721
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
 That's the part you're going to be stunned?

722
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
 That's the part where you stop and go,

723
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
 "Wait, is this logical?"

724
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
 I imagine if you go back into the old meat room,

725
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
 you hear the cows being like,

726
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:47,360
 "Why did you eat me?"

727
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
 I wonder if a vegetarian would hear that.

728
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 I wonder if this is real.

729
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 I guess I wonder if this is real.

730
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
 It does sound real.

731
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
 It doesn't actually know it totally doesn't sound real,

732
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
 but it could be real.

733
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
 It could be real.

734
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
 And then finally,

735
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
 we're touring this town and country market.

736
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
 We've seen everything so far.

737
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
 And so as we get ready to leave,

738
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 we order their specialty.

739
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,360
 Town and country market apparently have this specialty.

740
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
 German baloney.

741
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 According to theShadillands.net,

742
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 it says, "If you order a half pound of German baloney,

743
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 it is said that upon eating it,

744
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 you will perish in flames."

745
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 Would you do that?

746
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,360
 The question that plays every paranormal researcher is,

747
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
 "Would you do that?"

748
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
 I double-tear you.

749
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
 Zack, back into order,

750
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
 the half pound of German baloney.

751
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
 How far do you take your research?

752
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,360
 If some guy came to you with this ancient manuscript

753
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
 and said, "Everyone who's read this

754
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,360
 from Attila the Hun to Jimmy Carter

755
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
 has gone mad."

756
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
 After reading the last letter on the page.

757
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
 Would you read it?

758
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,360
 You feel like Jimmy Carter seems to be doing fine?

759
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
 No, he has that house-building obsession.

760
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
 Would you read it?

761
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
 Would you read that cursed transcript?

762
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
 Would you watch that piece of lost media

763
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,360
 that makes men rip their own eyeballs out?

764
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
 Okay, probably not that one.

765
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
 Probably not that one.

766
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
 The guy who's trying to show it to you,

767
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,360
 he's like, "My eyeballs got ripped out by myself,

768
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
 but here, I'm sure you will be okay."

769
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
 Put it in.

770
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,360
 He keeps dropping it as he's trying to hand it to you.

771
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,360
 Like, that's the thing. Paranole researcher, right?

772
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 There's so much stuff like the devil's chair.

773
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,360
 If you sit down in this chair, you'll die soon.

774
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,360
 Sometime between one day and 99 years, you will be dead.

775
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
 Would you eat a half pound of German baloney?

776
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
 I don't even know what that is.

777
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 I'm assuming it's just regular baloney.

778
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
 But with, I don't know, made out of German cows or something?

779
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,360
 Or pigs or whatever baloney's made out of?

780
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
 Would you eat it?

781
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 The shadow lanes don't necessarily blow up.

782
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
 You'll blow up.

783
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 If you ate it, would you eat it?

784
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,360
 Because here's the thing, on the one hand, I don't believe in superstitions.

785
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,360
 I'll walk underneath the ladder.

786
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
 I'll let a black cat walk in front of me.

787
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
 I do it all the time.

788
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
 Because I'm polite.

789
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
 I'm gonna hold the door open for him.

790
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,360
 But this isn't really a superstition.

791
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
 This is ghost stories.

792
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
 It's different. It's on a ghost website.

793
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
 It wasn't on a superstition website.

794
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,360
 Someone says, according to the ShadowLands.net,

795
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 if you eat a half pound of German baloney, you'll perish in flames.

796
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
 That's actually a lot of meat now that I think about it.

797
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,360
 That's a little bit...

798
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
 You might perish in something else. You might perish in your bathroom.

799
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
 You'll burst into flames if you eat this.

800
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,360
 And it says perish, so you might not burst into flames,

801
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,360
 but you may be driving down the road and getting a fiery car accident.

802
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,360
 Or you go to somebody's wedding and the entertainment is like a fire juggling dude.

803
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,360
 Oh my gosh, really shouldn't he eat that German baloney?

804
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
 As he's getting closer to you, he's like,

805
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
 "Who wants to join in on my act?"

806
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,360
 "Not me, not me. I eat the baloney."

807
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,360
 It's a fascinating and utterly bizarre haunted location.

808
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:17,360
 It almost does sound like the rifle butcher was trying to put this guy in a business.

809
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
 And it might have worked.

810
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
 It's like, "You don't want to shop there."

811
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,360
 The ghosts of the cows, you know, they're constantly haunting and talking to you.

812
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,360
 And I don't even get me started on the German baloney.

813
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
 You're like, "Well, I don't ever want to go there again."

814
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,360
 It almost sounds like a rifle is trying to put him out of business.

815
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,360
 Or it's some inside local joke.

816
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,360
 I don't know. These could be...

817
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,360
 I mean, when we look at the world of paranormal, all of these things could have happened.

818
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,360
 You could have went back into this old meat room and you hear cows.

819
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,360
 Going, "Ohhhhhhh."

820
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
 "Why'd you eat me?"

821
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,360
 "I'm not quite where to come from."

822
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,360
 It's not aside the realm of possibility.

823
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
 I mean, actually, another thing about...

824
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:08,360
 Have I ever covered an animal that died and then talked in the afterlife?

825
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,360
 I wonder if I've ever come out like a guy's faithful dog died.

826
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,360
 And then years later, the ghost Marmotuke, he's like, "Hey, guys, let's go on an adventure."

827
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,360
 I don't know. I don't know. It's so bizarre.

828
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,360
 And that's the thing. Like, back to the...

829
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360
 And we'll wrap it up like this. We're going a little long way.

830
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,360
 Back to the original story about the woman with the...

831
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360
 Or she thought she had a third eye.

832
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,360
 There's so much stuff you have to dig through.

833
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,360
 Like, how much of it is real? How much of it is fake?

834
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:46,360
 And because all of it, in a sense, sounds like a madman's delusion, you do wonder.

835
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 Like, at the end of the day, this story is only slightly more weird than the alien invasion of Casablanca.

836
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:01,360
 This story is only slightly more weird than just an average alien abduction story.

837
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
 Okay, that's not true. That's not true.

838
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 That's way weirder than people getting experimented on by Grace.

839
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,360
 But you know what I mean? Like...

840
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:14,360
 Is this real?

841
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,360
 And if this is fake...

842
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,360
 And it could be. Someone could have posted this on there as a joke, but...

843
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,360
 You have to look at everything. You have to look at everything.

844
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,360
 Even the ghost stories that we experience ourselves.

845
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,360
 Even the ones that I go, "I know that happened to me. I wasn't going insane.

846
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,360
 I thought I might have been going insane when I started seeing this crazy stuff, but I wasn't going insane."

847
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,360
 Actually, I had these paranormal events.

848
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,360
 Whether or not you can blow up if you eat German baloney, I don't know.

849
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,360
 I've never eaten German baloney and I've never blown up.

850
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,360
 But I know the paranormal events that I saw, that I interacted with, were absolutely true.

851
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,360
 And I've made that statement on this show since day one.

852
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,360
 I've been making that statement before I started this show.

853
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:06,360
 But at the end of the day, that young woman who thought she was growing a third eye

854
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,360
 had the exact same conviction that I do.

855
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,360
 When I talk about the paranormal events that I've personally witnessed.

856
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:21,360
 So you've always got to ask yourself,

857
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,360
 when you're researching crazy stuff,

858
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,360
 are the stories crazy?

859
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,360
 Are the people telling the stories crazy?

860
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 And are the people believing the stories? Are they crazy?

861
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,360
 No, I don't think so.

862
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,360
 I don't think so at all.

863
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,360
 That's what a crazy person would think too.
