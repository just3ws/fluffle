1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 Top Gun Maverick is the number one movie of the summer, Cobra Kai is the number one show

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,160
 on streaming, but to show that the 80s are really back in action, Satanic Panic is once

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,120
 again gripping America.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,920
 And then we take a look at a bizarre phenomenon, coincidence, really depending on who you ask.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,440
 Is it possible that the country of Mexico is so psychologically scarred by the great

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:38,680
 earthquake of 1985 that they keep manifesting another one on the exact same day.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:51,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,440
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,240
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone get on your feet for a valid soldier

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 in the war.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,680
 I don't know who we're fighting against.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,120
 Not paranormal stuff.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,600
 Give it up for Jerm.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 Yeah, come on in.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,840
 Jerm, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,200
 The reason why I'm selecting Jerm is this is, there's been multiple attempts over the

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
 years to do this and this one may not pan out.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,840
 This one may not pan out either, but I'm really hoping it does and Jerm is spearheading a Dead

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,920
 Rabbit Radio wiki.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,440
 So in the past couple days you may have noticed it in the show notes, we're really trying

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,760
 to get this Dead Rabbit Radio wiki off the ground because I'm constantly asking myself,

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
 have I covered this story before?

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,680
 And I have no doubt, not even I really have a database of what I've covered.

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,240
 I usually have to search the Dead Rabbit Radio, DeadRabbitRadio.Lipson.com.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,320
 It has a search tool where you can kind of put in keywords for episodes, but like you

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,640
 put in the word ghost and it'll come up with all the, it'll come up with every episode

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,920
 where I use the word ghost in the title or the description.

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,280
 This one hopefully will allow us a little bit more of what we've done and that's, that

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,480
 falls on you guys too.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,800
 If you guys could really help us backfill episodes and future fill episodes, basically

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
 I'm asking you to do all the work.

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
 But I would love that.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,760
 And recently on an episode I had mentioned, did I ever tell the story about the time

38
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,240
 that me and my good friend Jackie were hypnotized by a doll?

39
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,760
 And apparently I have not told that story.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,200
 Stuart Meatball on YouTube said he's listened to pretty much every episode, he's never

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 heard that story.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
 So that episode should be coming up.

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,880
 But again, I wasn't aware, I kind of threw that story off, off the top of my head.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,120
 That's a real story, it is a real story, but I was like, I don't know if I've ever done

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 this before.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
 If people contribute to the wiki, we could actually do that.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,880
 Right now I'm just putting show notes in, but people can put in little facts and stuff

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
 like that.

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
 I think it would be a lot of fun.

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
 I think it would really be a lot of fun.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 But let's get the episode started.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,320
 Jerm, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,400
 And if you can't support the show financially, help with the wiki or spread the word about

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
 the show.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,400
 Everything really, really helps out a lot.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,120
 We really need to do everything to help the show grow.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,440
 Jerm, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we are leaving behind

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 Dead Rabbit Command.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,600
 We're going to drive all the way out to Middle America.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,920
 Bop, bop.

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
 Jerm's driving us on out there.

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
 We're headed out to Middle America.

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
 Let me give you a little bit of background here real quick, because I've used the word

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,880
 Satanic Panic once or twice already.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,240
 And I want to just to clarify stuff, right?

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,680
 The Satanic Panic was this big thing back in the 1980s.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:45,880
 So what you had were these stories of preschools that were committing Satanic Ritual Abuse.

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,240
 So it wasn't just, you know, a daycare worker slamming a kid up against the wall.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,000
 Unfortunately, that happens all the time.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Nowadays it's caught on video.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I mean, it was bad enough.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,480
 I never understood the way you did it when it wasn't on video.

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,360
 But now that it is on video, definitely why are you doing it?

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,920
 You have abuse, obviously.

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,720
 Physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse of kids.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,280
 The ritual in it adds that the conspiracy theory was that they were performing this

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 as some sort of ritual.

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,760
 It wasn't that they were just sexually abusing children.

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,680
 They were doing it as a ritual, as a Satanic ritual, as calling forth for darker powers

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,120
 that they could then use to get power in the community to get wealth.

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,400
 All these deals with the devil's type of thing, right?

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,880
 Satanic Ritual Abuse, Sexual Ritual Abuse, S-R-A is the term you see.

83
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,800
 In preschools, daycare centers, townships, you know, these small towns spread across

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,920
 middle America, you would have these groups kind of operating in the darkness.

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,280
 And a lot of times they were connected to the elite of the town.

86
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,340
 So you had like the mayor's wife, and then you had like the guy who ran like the auto

87
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,720
 shop business, kind of like the cream of the crop, the people who you would not suspect.

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,800
 It was never greaseball Johnny down at the wrecking yard.

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 I mean maybe, right?

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,200
 It was never the people that you would suspect is what made this Satanic Panic.

91
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,240
 It was the elite of the small towns across America.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,440
 And I've said this before on the show, and I'm gonna reiterate it now.

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,360
 The Satanic Panic, I have never been an advocate that it's all made up.

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,900
 I have always believed that some of those stories were true.

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,480
 Some of them, sure, yes, it could have been a panic, but some of it was true.

96
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,960
 You did have people.

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,800
 I do believe this, that you had people in powerful positions being perverts.

98
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,760
 I know that might have shocked none of you, because we see it today.

99
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,080
 But it's so weird because we'll catch someone like Jeffrey Epstein today, and then you can

100
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,480
 read an article in the same newspaper talking about the Satanic Panic, and they're like,

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
 "Can you believe those yokeles?

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,680
 They used to believe that powerful people did horrible stuff to kids."

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,200
 That's ridiculous.

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,880
 Now you could say, Jason, well, yeah, people have always done stuff to kids, and always

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
 done.

106
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
 But the Satanic ritual abuse is making that ritual.

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,040
 Are you saying that these powerful people, even if it's just like local mayors and people

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,640
 working for lodges and churches and schools, are you saying that they were also saying

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
 worship?

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
 Yeah, totally.

111
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
 I think some of them were.

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,120
 And again, I'm not talking about Church of Satan, too.

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,960
 Church of Satan is a humanist religion that uses the name Church of Satan to troll Christians.

114
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,160
 They don't believe in Satan either.

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,320
 That name is a double-edged sword.

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,000
 On the one hand, it gets them a bunch of attention.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,160
 On the other hand, it gets them a bunch of attention, and they get wrapped up in all

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 this other stuff.

119
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
 I'm talking about saint worshipers.

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,520
 I'm talking about people who actually believe that Satan exists, and by doing stuff to appease

121
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,400
 him, you get power and money and more victims.

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,120
 I think the general consensus now is that the Satanic Panic was completely hyped, right?

123
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
 It didn't exist.

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
 None of them ever happened.

125
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 None of them ever happened.

126
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
 I don't believe that.

127
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 I believe some of them did.

128
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,840
 I don't believe all of them did, but I believe some of them did.

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,800
 Engaging this stuff, and I do believe some of them were saint worshipers.

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,680
 And so we have this really interesting article coming out from Reason.com, and it was written,

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,680
 it was published back on August 18, 2022, it was written by Elizabeth Nolan Brown.

132
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
 It's really interesting because it kind of goes against the narrative.

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
 It kind of goes against what we think.

134
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,440
 Because nowadays you think that people who believe in stuff like PizzaGate, people who

135
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,000
 believe in stuff like the elite are saint worshipers, QAnon type of stuff.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
 You imagine it's conservatives, right?

137
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
 It's Republicans.

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,880
 But take a look at this really cool article.

139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,680
 This article is published in Reason.com.

140
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,160
 It's called The Satanic Panic is Back, and it's bipartisan.

141
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,600
 And what happened was University of Miami political science professors, these two guys,

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,560
 Joseph E. Yusinsky and Casey Klostad did a national poll earlier this year, and these

143
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,880
 are the statistics they came up with.

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:16,200
 25% of Americans agree that "Satanic ritual sex abuse is widespread in this country."

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,840
 That's a huge percentage.

146
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,840
 That might have been what the percentage was back in the 1980s.

147
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,320
 That might actually be bigger.

148
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,880
 One in four Americans agree that "Satanic ritual sex abuse is widespread in this country."

149
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:41,920
 30% of Americans agree that "elites from government and Hollywood are engaged in a massive child

150
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,760
 sex trafficking racket."

151
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,280
 These are huge numbers of Americans who believe this stuff.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,480
 And what they did was they broke it down by political party.

153
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,920
 When we look at the breakdown politically, "Satanic ritual sex abuse is widespread."

154
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,800
 26% of Republicans believe that.

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,600
 29% of Democrats believe that.

156
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,640
 And that surprised me.

157
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
 That surprised me.

158
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,640
 Because that's not the narrative we're being told, right?

159
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
 That's not the narrative we're being told at all.

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,160
 We're being told that Pizza Gate is like a conservative Trump thing, right?

161
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,320
 That it's QAnon in the middle of this whole Adrenochrome stuff.

162
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,400
 Now they didn't specifically mention Adrenochrome, but that it all goes hand in hand.

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,480
 Now those percentages are pretty close, right?

164
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,160
 But still, you would think if you read the newspaper headlines that it would be, say,

165
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,640
 25% Republicans and 3% Democrats or something like that.

166
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,280
 But that's not the narrative.

167
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,320
 It's so interesting.

168
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 So imagine my surprise.

169
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,560
 I read that article on August 18th when it came out.

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,960
 I was a fascinating article.

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,680
 Imagine my surprise when on September 14th, MSNBC ran an article by Brandy Zardanzi.

172
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
 This is the headline for that one.

173
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
 "Satanic panic is making a comeback."

174
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 That sounds familiar.

175
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 Oh, okay.

176
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,720
 You're going to quote this steady.

177
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:14,800
 Quote, "Satanic panic is making a comeback fueled by QAnon believers and GOP influencers."

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,000
 Isn't that fascinating?

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And they don't really talk about the steady in this.

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 They do mention it.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,440
 They have another narrative thrust on their side.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
 But it's so interesting.

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,560
 Like the steady shows that that just isn't holding up.

184
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,600
 It's across the board, politically across the board.

185
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:43,880
 So listen, QAnon believers and GOP influencers may be riling this up, but that's not news.

186
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,600
 We've been told that for a long time.

187
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
 Now the question is why?

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,160
 Why do people believe in this?

189
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
 And there's a thousand different reasons for that.

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
 One of mine is a part of it's true.

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
 Some of it's true.

192
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,320
 We can look at these elite people who get arrested or don't really don't get arrested.

193
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,000
 How many people did R. Kelly have to abuse before he got arrested?

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,080
 And it's not like R. Kelly was sitting there at some Hollywood party all alone and being

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,960
 like, "Man, I really wish I could go home and be with my 13 year olds."

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,760
 He was bringing these girls to parties.

197
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,400
 And producers were meeting these girls.

198
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,480
 He was bringing these girls into recording studios and rappers and musicians from all

199
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,800
 around the industry were coming to his studio because he was a premier songwriter and they

200
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,280
 were meeting these girls.

201
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,380
 You cannot tell me that none of those other musicians or producers got in on that.

202
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,200
 We want it to be the singular thing.

203
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,760
 We don't want it to exist at all, but the idea that R. Kelly was just doing this and

204
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
 the producers were like, "Well, I don't know.

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,040
 He does seem to be hanging out with a lot of middle school students.

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
 Maybe we shouldn't have him on his album."

207
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
 And the producer going, "You know what?

208
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
 You're right.

209
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
 This guy's too gross.

210
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 We're not going to work with him.

211
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
 We'll go find some other songwriters."

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
 That didn't happen.

213
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 That never happened.

214
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,760
 That guy was so highly regarded in the industry.

215
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,880
 And what's funny is we knew about it.

216
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
 We knew about it.

217
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,840
 The jokes were going around.

218
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,000
 Dave Chappelle was doing skits about it.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,840
 We knew he was a pervert.

220
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,400
 He was still in Hollywood for years.

221
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,160
 So before we knew about it, it wasn't something that he woke up one day in 2004 and goes,

222
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 "Oh, you know what?

223
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 I'm missing in my life?"

224
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,720
 13-year-old girls.

225
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,160
 This was something he was doing for a long time.

226
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,280
 Powerful people were around him and they also got access to these girls.

227
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
 That is the way it worked.

228
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
 That is 100% the way it worked.

229
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,440
 And Hollywood goes, "Okay, he's arrested.

230
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
 That was an anomaly.

231
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,080
 Don't worry about that."

232
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,680
 And it churns up young girls and young boys, sucks them up into its vacuum.

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,720
 Some of them, nothing bad may never happen to them.

234
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,880
 Others, the worst could happen to them.

235
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,640
 But you don't have victims without perpetrators.

236
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,440
 We do know that Hollywood just devours young people.

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
 We just know it.

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,640
 Because we see it.

239
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,720
 And every so often, someone gets caught and then they're just like, "Wow, that guy was

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
 a creep."

241
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:19,040
 So it's a small leap from, we know these institutions, prey on young people because they're young,

242
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,260
 because they're malleable, because they're forbidden.

243
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,440
 We know that happens.

244
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
 It's a small leapologic to go to, "Oh, and they're also doing this for Satan.

245
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,800
 They're also doing this for power and wealth and fame and all the things that Hollywood

246
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 is famous for."

247
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,440
 A very, very small leap for that.

248
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,240
 So I don't think you're stupid for believing things like there's a bunch of saint worshipers

249
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,880
 controlling Hollywood.

250
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
 Is it true?

251
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 I mean, here's the thing.

252
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,080
 Is that part true?

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,200
 We do know that there are huge chunks of Hollywood that protect sexual predators.

254
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
 That's just, we know that.

255
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,920
 I could dump 100 articles in the show notes that talk about who was that.

256
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,920
 There was a school teacher, an on set school teacher, who got caught either molesting kids

257
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,560
 or caught a child porn, did a couple years in jail, prison.

258
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,520
 And when he came out, he got another job as an on set teacher.

259
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,720
 And they were like, "Well, he's a good teacher."

260
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,840
 So we know that exists.

261
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,160
 And we know that again, that's the exception, not because he didn't, but because he got

262
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,320
 caught because we know about it.

263
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,440
 So I definitely don't think you're dumb if you're one of the 30% that says elites from

264
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
 government in Hollywood are engaged in a massive child sex trafficking racket.

265
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,800
 I think that you do get into the sex ritual abuse.

266
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,680
 That's such a specific thing.

267
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,760
 But one in four Americans believe that.

268
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 That satanic ritual sex abuse is widespread in this country.

269
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,400
 I don't know if I would say that it is widespread, but it exists.

270
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,360
 And it's the people you wouldn't expect.

271
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,960
 I do think the elites in the government in Hollywood engaged in massive child sex trafficking

272
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
 is, I do think that's higher.

273
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
 I do think the likely, well, we know it's not.

274
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,320
 That is for, that's happening.

275
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,560
 I can't even say that's more likely, right?

276
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,880
 And child sex trafficking isn't just throwing a bunch of little girls on a boat and sending

277
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
 them across the country.

278
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,120
 It's literally being like, hey, I'm a teacher.

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
 I've identified this girl as a victim.

280
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
 You going to a high level movie producer and being like you want to meet up.

281
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
 That's trafficking.

282
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,840
 It doesn't have to be across state lines.

283
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,080
 You're actually moot just, that's trafficking.

284
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
 Of course that's happening.

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Disgusting.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I actually don't think I was going to talk so much about the sex trafficking part of

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 it.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,240
 I thought I was going to talk more about the satanic part of it, which is spookier and

289
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,920
 in a way less gross.

290
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,320
 Because is that happening?

291
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
 That is where you go.

292
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,080
 I don't, I do think it's happening.

293
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,000
 I do think it's happening in certain communities.

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,920
 And it's interesting because it is bipartisan.

295
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,760
 These polls show that.

296
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,160
 And it's so weird how they keep trying to turn this into a conservative versus liberal

297
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,640
 thing or Republican versus Democrat thing.

298
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,360
 When it is pretty bipartisan, I wonder why they are trying to make it a partisan issue.

299
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,920
 Good amounts of both parties believe this.

300
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,920
 And then what's the next step when one in four Americans believe that satanic ritual

301
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,080
 abuse is widespread?

302
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,600
 What happens then?

303
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,240
 Like the number is not going to shrink.

304
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,680
 There's no amount of information or education you can give if you believe this.

305
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,160
 There's no way to not believe it.

306
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,720
 Is all those inaccessible holes of power is where you believe this is happening at.

307
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,220
 That number will not shrink.

308
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,320
 That number will definitely go up.

309
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,280
 The question is how high will it go up?

310
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,920
 And when it hits a certain threshold, what happens then?

311
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,440
 I did very, very interesting statistics.

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,240
 I am a statistics nerd.

313
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,720
 I'm going to have to do with the paranormal or the world of conspiracy theory.

314
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,240
 I love them even more.

315
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,240
 Jerm, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

316
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
 We're leaving behind the middle America.

317
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,620
 The carboner copter is covered in graffiti of pentagrams.

318
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
 But we're not worried about that.

319
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,260
 Okay, I'm walking.

320
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
 I'm walking.

321
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
 Jerm's flying you guys.

322
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
 I'm like, I don't know.

323
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
 That thing might have been cursed.

324
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,140
 Also, I think if you can paint a pentagram on the side of a carboner copter, you could

325
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,500
 also loosen a couple of bolts.

326
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 So I'm on the ground.

327
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,940
 I'm like, I'll see you guys there soon.

328
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,460
 I'm going to walk.

329
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,860
 Jerm, fly everyone else all the way out to Mexico City.

330
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,440
 Late last night, it was probably like eight or nine o'clock.

331
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
 I was just getting ready to go to bed, call it an early night.

332
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,760
 I got an email from a listener.

333
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
 We've talked in the past.

334
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,560
 I think he sent me some other stuff, but I couldn't remember off the top of my head.

335
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
 Vince G.

336
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,240
 Vince G emailed me this just last night and I was like, perfect.

337
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,320
 That's an awesome story.

338
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,160
 Let's talk about September 19th.

339
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,420
 So I'm recording this episode on September 20th.

340
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:06,340
 So just yesterday for me, September 19th, 2022 in Mexico, you had a 7.7 earthquake.

341
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
 Only one person died.

342
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,580
 It's pretty good as far as earthquakes go.

343
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
 Limited damage.

344
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,020
 And they say the reason why, I mean, as powerful as the earthquake was, it hit a pretty sparsely

345
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,260
 populated area.

346
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,420
 And when it happened, everyone ran outside.

347
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,380
 There's video footage obviously on Twitter of this.

348
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,840
 I mean, these cars are rocking real hard, you know, just stuff kind of rocking around.

349
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
 But yeah, one person dead, limited damage.

350
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
 That's pretty good.

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,560
 But what's interesting is 7.7 earthquake, they happen, not a huge amount of casualties

352
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
 again, which is good.

353
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
 I'm not like, oh, I don't know anything.

354
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,640
 Talk about them with podcast.

355
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,680
 Massive amounts of people didn't die.

356
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,880
 What made this earthquake notable wasn't the size of the earthquake, but the date of the

357
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,680
 earthquake.

358
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 Let's go back in time.

359
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,580
 Let's go back in time.

360
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,420
 We're headed all the way back to the year 1985.

361
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,180
 September 19th, 1985.

362
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,600
 And an earthquake that registered 8.0 on the Richter scale strikes Mexico City.

363
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,540
 When this earthquake hit Mexico City back in 1985, it devastated the city.

364
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:26,880
 You had over 300 buildings completely crumble, including a hospital, hospital Juarez, which

365
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
 is where they had their blood bank, which is where they had their helipad for their

366
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,440
 medical helicopters.

367
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:40,380
 The hospital was 80% at capacity and it was a staff change.

368
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,080
 So you had basically double the staff because you have the people who are still there getting

369
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,780
 ready to leave and you have the doctors and nurses coming into start work.

370
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,980
 When this hospital collapsed, it basically not only killed hundreds of people in the

371
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,680
 hospital, also limited your recovery efforts.

372
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,720
 You lost so many medically trained personnel in the earthquake.

373
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,500
 They were also killed in the collapse.

374
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,060
 You lost your medical helicopter, you lost your blood bank.

375
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,120
 So it was this double whammy on the city.

376
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,440
 Over 300 buildings completely crumbled.

377
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
 Horrible disaster.

378
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,200
 The death toll from this earthquake in 1985 varies.

379
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,520
 You have different sources saying different things.

380
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,520
 And part of the reason why is that you had the immediate estimates.

381
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,640
 People could look at the damage of the city and say, "Well, these many buildings completely

382
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,860
 crumbled and then we have this percentage of buildings that partially collapse.

383
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,180
 We're looking at all these roadways.

384
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,540
 We're looking at the whole picture.

385
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,060
 We can make an estimate of how many people died."

386
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,660
 But then we have to start the recovery effort because maybe it will be something where I

387
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,740
 remember when I was down in the Bay Area where that big earthquake hit, I think it was an

388
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,180
 88, and we watched that freeway.

389
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,580
 It was a double decker freeway and it had collapsed upon itself.

390
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,320
 And we had been as a family up and down that freeway during rush hour traffic 100 times

391
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,760
 and it was bumper to bumper.

392
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,360
 And I remember me and my brothers, we were hanging out of the house.

393
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
 Who else was there?

394
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 Matt.

395
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,800
 Anyways, we were looking at the freeway and it collapsed and we were having a party.

396
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,880
 We were like, "Woohoo, we survived an earthquake."

397
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,960
 We thought it was really cool.

398
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
 Our parents were home.

399
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
 We survived an earthquake.

400
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,520
 It was a big one.

401
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,280
 When we saw that freeway had collapsed upon itself, we go, "Oh my God, there has to be

402
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,820
 hundreds of people dead in there.

403
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
 Families.

404
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
 Hundreds of families dead in there."

405
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,660
 And that's what the people, like I remember there was flying the helicopters over and

406
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,340
 rescue personnel was trying to get in there.

407
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,420
 And if I remember correctly, it was less than 12 people died.

408
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,460
 And then people go, "How is that possible?"

409
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,740
 Like that is bumper to bumper traffic and it happened during rush hour.

410
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,380
 And what it was was that year the World Series was between the Oakland A's and the San Francisco

411
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:04,200
 Giants and businesses were letting their employees go home early to watch the World Series.

412
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,280
 Had it not been for that single fact, there would have been hundreds of people killed.

413
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
 So you made an estimate, right?

414
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,560
 You looked at it, but once we started going in there, there was way less cars than there

415
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
 were supposed to be.

416
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,520
 So estimates for this earthquake vary.

417
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,000
 Even at the time when they're looking at the city, experts said there could be as high

418
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,500
 as 35,000 people dead.

419
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,940
 But after all the rubble was removed, after they were locating these bodies and bringing

420
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,420
 them out, the official government answer was only 5,000 people died.

421
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,380
 Because we have 5,000 bodies here.

422
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,780
 People didn't trust that number.

423
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
 People didn't trust that number.

424
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,980
 They didn't trust the president because when the earthquake happened, he called a media

425
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,160
 blackout and didn't address the nation until 39 hours after the earthquake.

426
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,240
 And that's why today, a lot of estimates say it wasn't just 5,000 people.

427
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,760
 When we look at the damage of the city, it wasn't just 5,000 people.

428
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,640
 The numbers range from the official number of 5,000 people dead to 45,000 people who

429
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,720
 were completely crushed or their remains were never found.

430
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,660
 Or they may have found the remains and the death toll number was lowered on purpose by

431
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
 the government.

432
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,700
 I actually believe this isn't a very common conspiracy theory, but this is something I

433
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,940
 believe in.

434
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,380
 Hurricane Katrina, the official death toll is 1,800.

435
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
 I don't believe that.

436
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,220
 I don't believe that at all.

437
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,420
 I think it's closer to 4,000 people who died in Hurricane Katrina.

438
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:46,700
 And when you look back at initial reports when it was happening and in the days afterwards,

439
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,520
 they were talking thousands upon thousands, like 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 people dead, but

440
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,080
 now the official number is 1,800.

441
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,640
 I don't believe that.

442
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
 I think that's fake.

443
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,560
 I think the number, they made up that because any number higher, I honestly think it was

444
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,920
 higher than the death toll on 9/11, see, and that was, this was my conspiracy theory, that

445
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,240
 they didn't want that.

446
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,400
 They didn't want that number out there because it, Hurricane Katrina was 100% avoidable.

447
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,640
 There's other conspiracy theories that they blew the levies up on purpose.

448
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,580
 People do an episode on that someday because it's kind of obscure now, but yeah, I do believe

449
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
 that.

450
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,340
 I do believe that when it comes down to can we benefit from the number being high?

451
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,820
 Governments will boost the number and if they can benefit from the number being low, Hurricane

452
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,080
 Katrina being completely avoidable.

453
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,420
 This city, this disaster, it looks so bad on the president because the infrastructure

454
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,940
 wasn't there.

455
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,740
 These buildings crumbled.

456
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,700
 5,000 people dead.

457
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,300
 And how would you know, right?

458
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,160
 You would assume as a family that the person or the whole, all the people who died in your

459
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,120
 family, let's say you lost three relatives in the, you would think those three people

460
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,960
 were part of the 5,000, but you don't realize that there are 10,000 families that lost two

461
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,560
 or more people in Anazap.

462
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,360
 So anyways, it was a huge event.

463
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,720
 It was a massive event that struck at the psyche of the country of Mexico.

464
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
 It terrified them.

465
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,540
 This was a massive earthquake in modern times.

466
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,660
 They're watching a civilized industrial city crumble.

467
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:29,100
 So by the year 2017, there were actually memorial events set up for the September 19th earthquake

468
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,960
 of 1985.

469
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,380
 So on every September 19th, you had people coming out and remembering those that were

470
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,500
 lost.

471
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:47,360
 Even in the year 2017, those remembrance ceremonies were still going on.

472
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:56,920
 On September 19th, 2017, one of these remembrance ceremonies was going on at a school when another

473
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,240
 earthquake struck Mexico.

474
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:11,100
 This particular school teachers and children were killed while remembering those who died

475
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,660
 back in 1985, on that same day back in 1985.

476
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:22,040
 But luckily, we learn, right, the infrastructure began to be built better.

477
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,140
 People were trained on what to do during earthquakes.

478
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,120
 So in the earthquake that happened in 2017, only 370 people died around that number.

479
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,040
 And again, that's kind of an agreed upon number.

480
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,760
 You just had a better built infrastructure.

481
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,980
 But now you've had it happen twice on the same day.

482
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,280
 You have a one out of 365 chance that it's going to happen on the same day.

483
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,600
 That's just really the thing of it.

484
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:01,860
 When people were on edge, then we have the earthquake that just happened yesterday.

485
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,700
 It's interesting because there's a lot of different ways you can look at this, right?

486
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,940
 Like I said, it's a one in 365 chance that you have this earthquake.

487
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,260
 I did digging up, again, I'm a statistics nerd.

488
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,300
 I was digging it up.

489
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:20,260
 Since 1950, there's been around 63 earthquakes in the entirety of the country of Mexico that

490
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,040
 have been over 5.5 on the Richter scale.

491
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,280
 So less than one a year is when we have these big earthquakes.

492
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,000
 And it doesn't happen every September 19th, right?

493
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,280
 There's a lot of September 19th where this doesn't happen.

494
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,560
 But like I've said on this show before, once, when something happens one time, it's an event.

495
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,560
 But it happens twice, it's a coincidence, and if it happens three times, it's a phenomenon.

496
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,720
 But is there something about this state in particular?

497
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,620
 Kind of what the theory, I was talking to Vince a little bit about this last night, very briefly.

498
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:02,740
 But the idea is, is I remember asking him, can you tolpa an earthquake?

499
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,460
 Can you manifest an earthquake?

500
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,700
 It's a really interesting way to look at it, right?

501
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,820
 Vince G was saying the idea is, this was kind of the theory he was, he was throwing over

502
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:20,400
 to me, is that the first earthquake in 1985 so psychologically scarred the people of Mexico

503
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,120
 that their fear of another massive earthquake has caused these two.

504
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,040
 That their fear is manifesting this.

505
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,920
 Super fact, I mean like I can't, again as a rational person, you would say this is just

506
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,280
 a coincidence, but putting on our conspiracy hats and looking at this.

507
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,820
 Can you, and to be fair Vince also says that he thinks it's a coincidence as well, but

508
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,620
 can your fear of something cause it to happen?

509
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,620
 Again, it's such an interesting thing, and this would be on a national scale.

510
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,700
 Is it possible?

511
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,020
 Now obviously when I was thinking about that, I go well, people were afraid after 9/11, people

512
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,420
 were, especially because you know the anniversary, right?

513
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,780
 People were like, oh the next anniversary was something going to happen.

514
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,840
 People were terrified of another 9/11, but that, a terrorist act.

515
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,240
 So funny I got so much email last time when they were like, what you believe the official

516
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 story?

517
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,240
 Anyways, an act of terror against the World Trade Center took so many moving parts, actually

518
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,560
 whether or not you believe it's an inside job, right?

519
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:36,960
 It takes so many moving parts to do, and it involves so many other people.

520
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,120
 The Earth, I'm going to get real kind of hippy on you guys.

521
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,300
 The Earth is an organism, it's one singular thing that is part of us and we are part of

522
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,220
 it.

523
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,820
 So I don't think you could manifest a bunch of terror attacks, I don't think you could.

524
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,020
 I mean unless you're the one causing them then you can do it all day long, you don't

525
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
 know what I'm causing them with.

526
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,940
 I don't think the fear of a terror attack would necessarily cause a terror attack, but

527
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,000
 could you manifest an earthquake?

528
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,520
 Could the population of a country be so afraid of another massive earthquake?

529
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,500
 Because the Earth is more of an organism, right?

530
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 It's part of us.

531
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,580
 I know this is, you guys are like, wow Jason you're getting really, really weird right

532
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
 now.

533
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,240
 This is the part where you think I'm getting weird talking about R. Kelly's recording studio.

534
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
 You know what I mean?

535
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,220
 I guess I'm saying this, maybe the Earth is easier to manipulate.

536
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,100
 Maybe the Earth is easier to manifest things out of.

537
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,860
 I don't know.

538
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,220
 I mean I don't know the answer.

539
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,220
 The normal answer would be this is a coincidence, but it's happened three times now.

540
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,660
 In what has it been since 1985?

541
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,220
 This is how I do math.

542
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,420
 1995, that's 10 years.

543
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,940
 2005, that's 20 years.

544
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,220
 2015, I'm lost again.

545
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,920
 I'm lost count.

546
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,400
 It's been less than 40 years.

547
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,280
 It's been less than 40, I feel confident in that.

548
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,400
 You've had three earthquakes on the same day in less than 40 years.

549
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
 I don't know.

550
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 It could be that, right?

551
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,640
 They could be manifesting it.

552
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,200
 It could be those people who often say every time I look at the clock it's 11, 11.

553
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,120
 That's not true.

554
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,480
 Like that would require you only to check a clock twice in your entire day.

555
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
 I mean I don't know.

556
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,660
 I'm constantly looking at my watch.

557
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,100
 If you're ever standing next to me and I look at my watch, I'm not being rude.

558
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,300
 It's just something I do.

559
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,660
 I always look at my watch.

560
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,700
 So if you only look at every time I see these posts all the time, every time I look at the

561
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,500
 clock it's 11, 11.

562
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,700
 I mean, is it a coincidence?

563
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
 Are they manifesting this?

564
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,860
 It'll be super interesting.

565
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,180
 I gotta say, I hope nobody dies in these things, right?

566
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,180
 I'm not like, oh yeah, here comes paranormal research.

567
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,300
 I'm hoping that no one dies in these things, but man, wouldn't it be amazing or maybe that's

568
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
 the wrong word?

569
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,700
 Wouldn't it be interesting if within the next year or two there's another earthquake on

570
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,860
 September 19th?

571
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,240
 I think right now people are kind of going like, could it be that we're manifesting this?

572
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,340
 If it kept happening, obviously we're gonna start going from that to some sort of weapon

573
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,940
 being used against us.

574
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,660
 Going back to the whole being afraid of terror in other country oppressing Mexico, another

575
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,580
 country triggering this earthquake on purpose.

576
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,820
 If you had this weapon, you would use it when it caused the most damage.

577
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,540
 Even if that's not the most physical damage, the most psychological damage.

578
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,780
 So if this continues to happen, I don't imagine it to happen next year, but who knows, right?

579
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,580
 It may come down to that.

580
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,500
 We may see it kind of move away from, oh, is this something we're causing through our

581
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,140
 fear, our psychic energy to straight up?

582
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,180
 Oh, someone's doing this on purpose.

583
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,860
 Somebody is doing this on purpose.

584
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,700
 It's a rival government that's actually triggering these earthquakes on purpose.

585
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
 Fascinating conspiracy.

586
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,460
 Thank you so much Vince for sending over.

587
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,980
 A lot of people are reporting on it.

588
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,540
 The LA Times did an article about the curse the day.

589
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,940
 A lot of people are talking about this.

590
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,940
 So is it cursed?

591
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
 Is it a coincidence?

592
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,040
 Fascinating story.

593
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,300
 But I wanted to end this episode with a story of hope that came out of the Mexico City

594
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,540
 earthquake in 1985.

595
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,660
 This is so fascinating.

596
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,340
 What happened was when that, let's go back to the hospital war as you're really chasing

597
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,900
 that you're at banding with the hospital that collapsed and killed everyone inside of it.

598
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,300
 There was this very, very famous story that came out of this collapse.

599
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,420
 I mean, obviously you had thousands of stories of survival and loss, but let's take a look

600
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,140
 at this one.

601
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,240
 When the hospital collapsed, it was a fully functioning hospital.

602
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,840
 One of the rooms in it was the nursery where newborn babies were placed.

603
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,560
 Sit around and roll around in their little glass cribs.

604
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,600
 Just you know, they're new to the world.

605
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,960
 These people just came out of their mama and then some stranger they've never met.

606
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,880
 I mean, they've never met anyone they've been in a womb for nine months, but they're then

607
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,900
 placed by loving hands inside of these little cribs and they just kind of roll around.

608
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,260
 They're feeling things for the very first time.

609
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,140
 They're feeling a blanket.

610
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,700
 They're feeling the cold air of the nursery touching against their cheeks.

611
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
 Beautiful, right?

612
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,620
 These little baby people.

613
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,460
 September 26th, 1985.

614
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:46,880
 Seven days has passed since the earthquake rocked Mexico City, devastated Mexico City.

615
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,000
 Seven days have passed since the hospital had turned to rubble.

616
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,600
 Rescue crews moving debris.

617
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
 Here's some babies.

618
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,480
 Hey, come over here, Johnny.

619
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,240
 Johnny, get the shovels, get the backhoe, get whatever.

620
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,440
 They hear babies in the rubble.

621
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,820
 The rescue crews going overtime.

622
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,760
 These days seven people got some sore muscles, right?

623
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,600
 People are running off of just pure adrenaline now.

624
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,840
 They hear babies in the rubble.

625
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:28,560
 They find all of the babies who were in the nursery alive.

626
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,460
 They're called, I know it doesn't make any sense.

627
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
 It totally sounds made up.

628
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,380
 They're called the miracle babies or the miracle of hospital war as all of the babies.

629
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,000
 I mean, for all I know there's only two, even two would be a miracle, right?

630
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,320
 I'm not like, well, there's not 20 of them.

631
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,120
 All of the babies, their mothers died.

632
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,040
 All of their mothers died when the hospital collapsed.

633
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,680
 But this nursery, for whatever reason, I mean, obviously we look at divine intervention here,

634
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
 right?

635
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,800
 A miracle.

636
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:07,320
 They had no food, no water, no warmth, and no human contact during that time period.

637
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:12,060
 Not a nurse to comb them down.

638
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,200
 Not a mom to hold them tight and tell them everything's going to be okay.

639
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,980
 These babies survived.

640
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,300
 I do have to say though, I do have to say though, I looked at my note here.

641
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,080
 I'm going to look this up real quick.

642
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,740
 In total, 14 babies lived.

643
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
 I did.

644
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,740
 I did.

645
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,320
 I have to double check my notes.

646
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,480
 Two of them passed away after they were pulled from the rubble.

647
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,040
 But 14 of these babies lived truly a miracle.

648
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,400
 Truly a miracle out of all of that destruction, out of all of that chaos, out of all of that

649
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,640
 loss of life.

650
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:05,700
 Even among the rubble buried underneath tons of concrete, miracles can still happen.

651
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,060
 Maybe that's a lesson we can all remember.

652
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,180
 The next time we're filling down, we're underneath tons of rubble.

653
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,460
 Maybe we can remember that miracles do still happen.

654
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,020
 Because I think we forget that lesson a lot.

655
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,580
 I really do.

656
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:29,560
