1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 A sexual subculture many thought did not exist, but new video evidence has come to light.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,560
 And the wonder drug you've always wanted, but never heard of, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:21,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day. I hope you're beating this heat

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
 that seems to be beating the planet up right now. The sun is taking its revenge against us,

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,920
 or the ozone layer has a big hole. Maybe the reptilians are terraforming our planet to make it

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
 more suitable for their alien needs. Or maybe it's just a heatwave. I don't know.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,160
 But it doesn't matter. It's really hot. Just think, soon you guys won't have to hear me complain

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,160
 about this stuff. And I'll be happy about that too. I'm not a fan of doing stuff for the sake of irony,

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,000
 like liking something to be ironic. I like stuff that I genuinely enjoy. I like the first three

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,360
 Transformers movies. The second one sucked, but the third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon,

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,040
 argue with me on this. The third Transformers movie Dark of the Moon is the best alien invasion movie

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:23,040
 of the 2000s, and in the top five of all time. It is an amazing alien invasion film. The Battle of

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,960
 Chicago is great. Anyways, I'm getting off topic. Watch Transformers 3, argue with me if you think

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,200
 I'm wrong on that. But one of my likes that I genuinely enjoy watching that people think that

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,040
 I'm an idiot for is I love watching reality shows. And I like, I don't watch them so much now, because

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
 I never have my television on. I just watch movies. And they're on Netflix, but I really don't like

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,080
 watching Netflix that much. But when I do, I'll binge watch a reality show. I just like watching

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,760
 real people, and I know a lot of it's staged. I know a lot of it's edited up, but I like watching

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,560
 these subcultures. I think the best reality shows are about subcultures. Not a fan of stuff like

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,400
 Big Brother, or what was that one with the girls on the beach with the boy, and all the chicks were

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,200
 hot. It was called like the Hill Laguna Beach. Laguna Beach never was into that. Early real world

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,920
 was okay. I liked watching stuff like the Dallas cheerleader reality show, which really is the

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,400
 perfect example of dad porn. That's what I talked about on the last episode, where it's, it's porn,

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,960
 you know, air quotes that you can watch that a man can watch and people don't think anything is going

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,440
 on. You're watching these young, beautiful, new biowomen dance around. They were in really short

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,240
 skirts. What I like about it, that, I mean, obviously these beautiful women, I also like

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,960
 competition based reality shows. I like this, not like a game show one, but shows where people

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,160
 are competing in their subculture. Like the Dallas, you're watching this huge group of women, and you

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 know by the end of the season, there's only going to be seven of them who are going to start a very,

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,320
 very hard job, because they have to try out each year. Okay, that being said, I really join watching

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,800
 reality shows. So back when I was about 35, I got mono. Really bad. They had to put me in an

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,680
 isolation ward in a hospital, and I was there for three days, and all the nurses and the doctors and

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,640
 stuff had to mask up before they came in. I had a terrible infection, and I didn't have a smartphone

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
 back then. This is probably like 2010. So I had no internet, but I did have access to the television

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,240
 hospitals have great cable nowadays. And I flip through the channels and I found two programs

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,600
 to watch. One of them was a two hour sit down interview with President George W. Bush, former

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,680
 president at this time. Now I was never a big fan of President Bush when he was in office. Watching

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
 him give this really candid interview talking about how he felt making these decisions in his

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
 presidency, his regrets, the stuff that he the decisions he still stood by was fascinating.

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,160
 It's fascinating. It was almost like watching someone that you considered a direct enemy to you,

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,960
 sit down and explain to you why they made the decisions they made. Didn't agree with everything

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,840
 he said in that interview, but it was fascinating nonetheless. The other option that I had to

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,160
 watch the other thing I was and of course I had 100 options, but the other show I kept flipping back

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,880
 to was toddlers in TRS, a reality show based around six year old girls trying to win beauty pageants.

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,560
 Again, it was a competitive based reality show of a subculture I am not a part of. I don't have any

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,760
 other interest in it if it didn't exist in a reality show. You're watching these mothers

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,440
 basically berate their children while roughly combing their hair and the little girls are

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,760
 going back and forth between being super happy that she's in a beauty pageant to being bored

50
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,920
 and the mothers give them pixie sticks to keep them all hyper during the competition. It is a

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,480
 incredibly bizarre alien subculture to me. I'm flipping back and forth between the two shows,

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,160
 Bush interview toddlers in TRS, Bush interview toddlers in TRS. When each commercial rate comes

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,320
 on each, go back and forth, toddlers TRS, it was like a marathon. So I'm sitting there in the hospital

54
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,040
 and what happens when you're in the hospital and they're pumping you full of painkillers?

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,840
 You fall asleep, but a half hour later I wake up a nurse is walking into my room to deliver me

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,280
 some more pain medication and in that darkened room late at night a grown man is watching toddlers

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:31,840
 in tears. Oh, if you're listening medical staff of the Folsom hospital where I was treated,

58
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,280
 I was just flipping between channels and I really like reality shows and involve competition.

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,480
 Nothing else. Let's go ahead and get started with the episode. So I'm going to give you a little

60
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,120
 warning right now. I'm going to cover the miracle drug story now because the sexual conspiracy story

61
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,240
 we're going to cover is so gross that it's you don't want to be making food or eating food or

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
 thinking anything about food or really anything while you're listening to that. So I'm putting

63
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,200
 this story first so you can go click at the end of it and go man that was a great episode

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,320
 and keep your mind pure of what we're going to talk about. What we're going to talk about right

65
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,160
 now is a miracle drug, a miracle drug that could change the way people achieve beauty. I don't feel

66
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
 like I'm overselling this. This is amazing. I came across it. This one was actually on the

67
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,400
 conspiracy list surprisingly enough. I found it very quickly and I thought well this is going to

68
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,280
 be what they're talking about but this is a miracle drug. So the miracle drug is and I'm

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,320
 going to mispronounce this but I'll have the links below Melanotan2. Melanotan2 it's a steroid

70
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,960
 and the doctors were trying to create something that would prevent skin cancer that would help

71
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,520
 people not get skin cancer. So they invented this steroid and they began testing it and what they

72
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,280
 realized that once you inject this you can inject it into the fatty tissue of your stomach.

73
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,400
 They've also created nasal spray version for wimps like me but what they realized is you take it,

74
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,280
 you go out to the sun for an hour, an hour, two hours whatever, you begin tanning, your skin becomes

75
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,480
 darker and that does help definitely with skin cancer but the doctors are like whoa whoa whoa

76
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,280
 wait a second so this actually is a tanning aid. Like if you take this you no longer have to sit

77
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,600
 out in the sun for hours on end. You can have or even do a quarter of the time tanning your skin

78
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,760
 will become dark which you know a lot of people find very attractive. I personally like my choice,

79
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,920
 I prefer very pale girls like jellyfish pale, translucent. I want to be able to see their

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,320
 organs inside of like I grew up in that age of Gothic girls. I just love like that super pale

81
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,960
 skin but tan girls hey man yeah that's pretty hot too you know it's not my go-to or anything but

82
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,520
 so this drug they're like whoa it really helps you tan. Now it has a second effect it's not as

83
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,240
 big as the tanning thing and it's a lesser effect but you take the steroid you lose weight so not

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,960
 only does it give you a tan, a healthy tan and it doesn't like age your skin because it's the UV

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,240
 rays that actually make your skin get leathery. The darkening of the skin itself with this drug

86
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,280
 doesn't give you all the bad side effects of being out in the sun forever it also helps you lose weight

87
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,160
 and if that wasn't good enough I own no stock in any of these companies there's not going to be an

88
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
 affiliate link below all of the links below are going to be information I think one or two of

89
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,280
 them from a store but I don't have any affiliate deals with them I don't want you to think that I'm

90
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,640
 a spokesman for this product. Not only does it give you a tan not only does it help you lose

91
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
 weight if you're a man it gives you an erection and there is a spin-off version that if you're a woman

92
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:55,680
 it gets you wet a wonder drug. One of the scientists tested it on himself and had a four

93
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,360
 hour long erection now I gotta say I admire the guts on that scientist to go you know what here

94
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,520
 screw it and just inject himself with this steroid they're working on now the only side effects

95
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:18,480
 a little bit of nausea dizziness that's it I think a little bit of vomiting which is probably just

96
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,360
 more of a side effect of the nausea they tested this and tested this company so fought over it

97
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
 and they had to like split the patent and then reunite the patent they're working on all this

98
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,800
 stuff when it's already on the market it's already on the market you can order it now

99
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,000
 my thing is like I'm not going to buy a little clarivial of liquid on the internet and then

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,240
 inject it into my body actually surprisingly I have a story about that one day I got a letter

101
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,760
 with a product on it and so I opened up the envelope it's just a regular white envelope

102
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,160
 had a piece of paper a little baggie at the top of it and stapled to the piece of paper and inside

103
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,600
 it was a pill and I'm reading the letter and it says congratulations you have been chosen as one of

104
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,120
 the first people to take our new supplement it will increase your sex drive it'll make your dick

105
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,080
 bigger it will make you last longer as I'm reading the article I have already opened up the baggie

106
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:22,880
 swallowed the pill now I thought about it maybe a half hour afterwards to put a little time period

107
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,360
 on this story this happened I got this letter maybe two months after 9/11 and I thought about

108
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,200
 a half hour later after I'd taken this pill I thought if Al Cato wanted to kill a million

109
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,240
 American men overnight they would just send out cyanide pills and say this will make your dick

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,560
 bigger and the next day the streets would be a wash of dead men obviously it wasn't cyanide

111
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,400
 and to top the story off the pill didn't even work didn't work for me but this this melaton

112
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,560
 and melaton too and the on the conspiracy list it's listed as trend tanning because trend is

113
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,240
 another term I think trend is another term for steroids in general but it's another term for

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,960
 this steroid this is on the conspiracy list it's listed on there because it's basically a wonder

115
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,240
 drug that nobody knows about and the fact that it's not the most popular supplement at Walmart or

116
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 every store across the planet is shocking and I think it's probably the delivery method more than

117
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,640
 anything people don't want to inject themselves with stuff but they perfect that nasal spray

118
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,800
 everyone will have a tan everyone will lose weight and everyone will want to bang all the time

119
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,080
 we're going to go ahead and move on to this story now this story is like I said really gross so if

120
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,400
 you want to cut out right now I don't blame you and Veronica dear dear sweet Veronica I know you

121
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,800
 have an aversion to I know you're a germaphobe so it was great having you listen to this far

122
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:04,480
 of the episode and I will see you on tomorrow's episode you should leave now bug chasing people

123
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,800
 believe there was a myth for a long time people believed that bug chasing was not something

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,040
 they thought it was a smear campaign against gay men so what is bug chasing bug chasing is a

125
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:26,080
 subculture of gay men who knowingly and willingly affect infect themselves with the AIDS virus or

126
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,560
 HIV I'm going to use them interchangeably I know that the terminology is different but

127
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:41,120
 so they will go out and get AIDS on purpose they consider they call it the gift so I'm a man and

128
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,800
 I'm a bug chaser I'm going to find a gift giver I want the gift I want that virus inside of my body

129
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,880
 when a man gives me his gift I want it to be as toxic as possible I want the strongest form of

130
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,640
 AIDS that you can give me there have been stories of people it's getting it's going to get rough

131
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,080
 from here on out guys so if the rest of the audience wants to leave go ahead there are stories of

132
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:16,880
 people who will cut their butthole open to make it easier for the semen the infected semen to go

133
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
 into their bloodstream because you can have sex with someone with AIDS and not catch it just like

134
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,680
 any disease I can swallow someone sneezing in my mouth and not get the flu that's actually grosser

135
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,880
 than the semen thing I think but so they will you know the the bug chasers who aren't infected yet

136
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,520
 lament the fact that they don't have it and so they will engage in random generally it goes in

137
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,720
 stages they'll engage in unprotected sex with random people then they'll begin seeking out gift

138
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,240
 givers and usually people in the subculture who have the virus will have a biohazard symbol tattooed

139
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,600
 somewhere on their body to let people know that they have it and then when that doesn't work if

140
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,720
 they still don't get the virus they'll begin cutting their butthole open or injecting injecting

141
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,520
 AIDS infected blood right into their own bloodstream or into their butthole and then when that doesn't

142
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,000
 work they go to even more extreme measures now this like I said was considered an urban legend

143
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,520
 for a long time people just thought it was a smear campaign and you would see evidence I had heard

144
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,200
 about bug chasing years and years and years ago and I thought that's just insane oh and you know

145
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,320
 people always go what's the motive and there are several motives some of them just want to get it

146
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
 over with they go you know what I know I'm going to get AIDS eventually so I just want to get it

147
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,360
 out of the way other ones see it as a form of life living inside of them it's their version of having

148
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,840
 like a life form like a baby almost another life form inside of them they needed to take care of

149
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,600
 some of them just like the thrill of possibly catching it they'll have parties where there's

150
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
 20 minutes in a room and one will have AIDS and the rest of them will be clean and you just have

151
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,400
 sex randomly and will you get it will you not I read a heartbreaking article some people get it

152
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,440
 in certain cities so they can get benefits I read an article today when I was doing some more

153
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,880
 research on bug chasing there is these young men in New York City who were realized that if you had

154
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,520
 AIDS you could get housing allowances and public assistance and all of these things from the government

155
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,400
 this one kid got it and accidentally he didn't mean to get it but once he found out that he

156
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,400
 could get all these benefits he was like I'm glad that I got AIDS because now I'm not living on the

157
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,880
 street anymore there isn't a the apartment that costs $1500 he only has to pay $200 for it the

158
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
 state pays the rest because they're taking care of these people one of the dangers too with bug

159
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,920
 chasing I just got more than the obvious one that you have AIDS now is some people who say well

160
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,160
 Lisa have AIDS now I don't have to worry about getting it anymore the pressure's gone you can

161
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,720
 actually get two different types of AIDS because it's this constantly mutating thing where if you

162
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,680
 already have AIDS and then you're still out engaging in unsafe sex and someone else has AIDS you can

163
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,880
 create super AIDS in your body and you die within weeks so it's not like this super manageable thing

164
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,760
 that people think it is a lot of people go oh you just take a pill every day or every you know you

165
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,560
 take your medication every month and you'll be fine and it's not that straightforward you can

166
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,120
 some people still die very quickly of it if it mutates too much so again I have to keep saying

167
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,520
 this if people thought it was an urban legend for the longest time about a year or two ago

168
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,640
 there was a video released a porn video released it was from a treasure island media which is a

169
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:49,280
 gay porn company and I read about this on vice media and it is a video of a one of those roulette

170
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,040
 parties but like I said there's 20 men in a room and one has AIDS and the rest are clean this one

171
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,680
 it's mostly guys with AIDS who are positive or pause is the terminology used only some are negative

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,520
 so it's this gay porno now I haven't been able to watch it but I did have to get a copy of it because

173
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:22,160
 and my copy is labeled do not watch in big bold letters 200 pause loads the culmination of this

174
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,880
 video there's photos of this on the vice article by the way is they take a jar of

175
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 they have a big mason jar and it's filled to the brim with you ever seen milk go bad

176
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,680
 and how it separates and all the cream rises to the top

177
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:55,200
 and the rest is like a yellowy liquid that's what this jar is but this jar is full of 200

178
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,840
 pause loads of semen so all the men in the room who were HIV positive jack jacked off

179
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:15,840
 into this jar the star of the video the guy the main bug chaser gets a funnel put into his butthole

180
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:25,920
 and and the jar is emptied into it now all of my wretched noises I would like to say was for

181
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:34,000
 comedic effect but like I said I own this video and I can't bear to watch it I have it more as a

182
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,040
 curiosity than anything it's like I've said before I don't watch porn I don't have a huge

183
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:52,480
 collection of porn at all this is what one of the videos which means when I die and someone's

184
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,320
 going through my computer they're like man he has a lot of pictures of Kate Upton and look at this

185
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:06,640
 old Sarah Michelle Geller photo whoa what's this video do not watch 200 anyway so he gets the funnel

186
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,240
 put in his butt and they dump the cum inside of him and at this point people are like okay this is a

187
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,320
 true fetish and what's interesting is the director goes on to say there's this isn't as small of a

188
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,400
 community as you may think it is I get over letters from a lot of people who fantasize about this I

189
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
 think that's the key I think a lot of people fantasize about a lot of stuff they would never go

190
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,880
 through with but bug chasing is real there are whole websites and forums and dating apps dedicated

191
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,960
 to it so people are willingly infecting themselves with aids for a multitude of reasons I can get

192
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,800
 being homeless and thinking well if I have aids at least I'll have a roof over my head very short

193
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,440
 term thinking but you know I can that's more logical than well I'm gonna get it anyways

194
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,800
 or creepier the group that's like it's this life form inside of me a part of my lover is inside

195
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,680
 of me I've come across stories I'll try to find some read it your own risk but I've come across

196
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:09,040
 stories in the past too where gay men who are the who carry the gift will have sex with other gay men

197
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,760
 who don't know they're infected that's a real problem too but that's part of the fetish as the

198
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,680
 gift giver is having unprotected sex with unknowing men and giving them the gift and now I'm a part

199
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,720
 of him forever I've changed his life in these five minutes his life will never be the same

200
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,200
 and when you read those stories on there the fetish person side who's writing it you're thinking

201
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,240
 this guy's really messed up and then to say the least but then when you think about the

202
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,480
 young man who's now you know if the disease takes their life has changed radically especially for

203
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 men who are just curious and now they have AIDS and you know they're married or whatever they

204
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,920
 have a girlfriend and now they have something you're gonna have to do with the rest of your life if

205
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:58,000
 you are engaging I'll put this out for everyone if you're engaging in any sort of if for gay men

206
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 you use be safe for straight men don't have sex with anyone you don't plan on having a baby with

207
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
 I know that sound may sound very period technical but that's something that I've learned as I got

208
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,080
 older I look back at women that I was with and I was like dude if that if I got that cheek pregnant

209
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,440
 would radically change my life just just use common sense guys use common sense use protection

210
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,040
 I'm not I don't really like it myself but nowadays if I'm with someone and I think that they would

211
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,360
 make a bad mother or I don't want to be with them outside of this small moment in time this use

212
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,040
 protection the same thing you may like for gay men you may like the semen in your but whole more

213
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,840
 but there are people out there there's small minority but there are people out there who

214
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,960
 will willingly infect you infect you with it is it really worth the risk is anything this is the

215
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,240
 key is anything worth the risk of that five minute moment of your life it's the same thing when I

216
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,360
 think of people who in Hood River we just had some guys arrested for trying to meet up underage girls

217
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,600
 and it's like is really what you're doing worth the rest of your life being changed that five minute

218
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,800
 moment the rest of your life being changed and it's not it never is however no wait there's no

219
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,560
 however to that it never is it never is I did want to say this though imagine if there was a bug

220
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:29,440
 chaser that you couldn't avoid imagine if there was a bug chaser who was spreading it randomly

221
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,280
 truly randomly I came across this post this is creepy and Veronica if you are still listening

222
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:42,720
 definitely shut it off now I love telling you people my secret I have bad genital herpes

223
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 when they flare up I go to the supermarket I'll go to the back of my van and pop

224
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,840
 I'll go to the back of my van and pop some juicy herpes and wipe it on my hands and fingers then

225
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:07,120
 go into the store I touch as much produce as possible sometimes I go to the store's bathroom to

226
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,800
 reload just to give you the freshest of my herpes juice sometimes I go to the baby section of

227
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,360
 the store Jesus Christ sometimes I'll go to the baby section of the store little teething babies

228
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,920
 love to chew on toys gross I forgot about that part this is our secret now you're good at secrets

229
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:37,440
 right yeah you're real good at secrets there are certain people who just need to be locked up

230
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:49,600
 and removed from humanity and this guy needs to be in a cell if he if this is true and he's rubbing

231
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,320
 what he calls his herp juice on produce and teething rings again it's probably his fetish

232
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,720
 he's probably jacking off the whole time thinking about it and the whole time doing it and then

233
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,280
 when he goes home he's fantasizing about doing it again now luckily for me I never eat produce and

234
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:16,720
 I don't use teething toys but whoever you are herp juice guy come on that's there that's a level

235
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:24,320
 of inhumanity that I think even shocks me dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be our email

 well you guys made it if you're still listening you guys made it to the end of the bug chasing

238
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,240
 episode we had a little bit of the good and the bad the trend stuff that's awesome hope it comes

239
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,920
 to market and I hope it gets easier to use not saying I want the deepest hand but it would just

240
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,240
 be interesting oh oh the dick thing is probably the best part button and then of course we had the

241
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,160
 bug chasing which I think again your germaphobe the herpy thing was really I hate to use this term

242
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,640
 but the icing on the cake as far as germaphobia goes that's going to be it we have one more episode

243
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,840
 of our sexual conspiracy list that will be tomorrow we're going to end it out with some

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,800
 interesting little tips here I'll give you a spoiler alert we're going to be talking about

245
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,000
 supernatural sex with demons and love spells I think those are interesting topics dead rabbit

246
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,040
 radio is the paranormal conspiracy and true kind podcast you don't have to listen to it every day

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:37,440
 but I'm glad you listen to it today I will see you tomorrow have a great one guys
