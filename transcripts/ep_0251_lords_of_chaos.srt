1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 A young girl sitting in a classroom flips out and starts breaking chairs.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,600
 You may think she was just having some sort of episode, but when others went to calm her down,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,960
 they began smashing things as well.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,320
 And then we look at the story of the Lords of Chaos.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,280
 They were a group of kids who thought the world was out to get them.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,280
 So they decided to strike first, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:41,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,440
 I don't know why I hesitated on that.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
 The day has been great.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 So let's go ahead and get started here with the first story though.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,780
 This is technically, I think this is our back to school episode, even though school's over

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,000
 for most people, but I got two stories.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
 We're going to school for these.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,920
 Now the first story, let's hop in the Carpenter copter because we are going over to India.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,520
 Now this story is incredibly recent.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,280
 We're talking January 31st, 2019.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,480
 We're in the town of Bitmal, Bitmattal India is where we're talking about.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,720
 Bitmattal India and in Bitmattal India there is a, it's weird because they keep referring

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,220
 it as a high school, but the girls in seventh grade, but apparently they call them high

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,220
 schools over there.

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,060
 The girls only in the seventh grade.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,620
 She's sitting in class is January 31st and everyone's just kind of chilling.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,340
 I guess they're actually learning main attention to the teacher.

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
 See I didn't do that in school.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,540
 That was the cool kid who sat in the back.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,060
 Did none of that learning.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,340
 So anyways, sitting in the back of class.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,660
 Oh no, no, she wasn't like me.

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,460
 She was sitting somewhere in class and everyone's reading or doing whatever you do during school.

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,160
 I'd spent so long and I didn't do it back then either.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,360
 She, I'll tell you a story someday about how I made a teacher go to a mental asylum.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
 That's a true story.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
 I didn't force her with like a pitchfork.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,080
 Like I tormented her so much she ended up going to, maybe not a mental asylum, but she

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
 definitely had a nervous breakdown.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,480
 So we'll tell that story some other time.

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,400
 Anyways, so aside from that interesting personal story, let's talk about this more interesting

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,780
 story.

42
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,800
 So this young girl's sitting in class and all of a sudden, like to snap everyone out

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,840
 of a daze, she leaps up out of her desk and starts shouting at the top of her lungs.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,880
 Now that would have to be, obviously when you're in classroom, people are generally

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,760
 talking at a conversational level and generally only one person is.

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,320
 So to have someone jump up behind you and start yelling is absolutely shocking.

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,080
 Everyone turns around and they're watching this seventh grade girl and I'm not going

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,340
 to imitate her yelling because a lot of people listen to this with headphones on or while

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,580
 they're sleeping.

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,060
 She's yelling and everyone's like, oh my God, so they kind of start like moving away

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
 from her.

52
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,900
 And at that point she picks up her chair and starts smashing it into the floor until it

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,060
 breaks and then she goes to grab another chair.

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,900
 At this point people are really concerned because she's not responding to anything.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,780
 A couple of her friends are like, calm down, calm down.

56
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,420
 They go, they grab her some water, which is usually, yeah, that's what you do when someone's

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,840
 rampaging, screaming, jumping around, destroying your classroom.

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,160
 You're like, you know what, maybe you're just parched.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,840
 Maybe you need a little bit of the agua.

60
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,280
 So they go to give her water and she's not getting the water, but what happens is these

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:39,760
 five girls are trying to console her and then they start going, and yell.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
 So now you have multiple girls yelling in this classroom.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,420
 And over the course of the next four days, the original girl and the other five girls

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,500
 who like went towards her while she was having this fit are getting progressively worse.

65
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,740
 They're just completely flipping out.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,180
 I'm sure it's not only they left her in the classroom for five days.

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,180
 I'm sure at some point the principal's like, get them out of here.

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,340
 So they're like riding the bus home.

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,900
 They're like tearing the bus up.

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,980
 They get out of the bus.

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,420
 They're like destroying the bus stop.

72
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,580
 They're like destroying hedges and stuff like that.

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,100
 Just screaming the whole way home.

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
 They didn't call the parents.

75
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,140
 They didn't let them know what's happening.

76
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
 The bus just gets off the bus.

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,680
 The mom's like, how was your day at school?

78
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 Smash and a recliner.

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
 The mom's like, oh, one of those days.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,640
 I remember high school.

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,400
 So anyways, the five girls are just flipping out.

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:33,000
 And over within seven days, an additional 14 girls have come down with this mystery affliction.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
 Nobody knows what it is.

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,080
 Obviously people have some theories.

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,920
 So there's basically three possible scenarios.

86
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,820
 As they're looking at this, this has gone on now for about a week.

87
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,540
 You have 19 girls flipping out.

88
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
 You have three possibilities.

89
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,820
 One, they're all faking it.

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,500
 It's some sort of elaborate joke, which honestly is quite funny.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,260
 But it could just be a joke.

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,100
 Secondly, mass hysteria, mass delusion.

93
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,260
 Or third, demonic possession.

94
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,580
 So those are basically the three scenarios they're looking at.

95
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,500
 You have these 19 girls are out of control.

96
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,780
 What's weird is that the principal is pretty on point with this thing.

97
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,160
 The principal gives a quote to the newspaper.

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
 This is the quote.

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,680
 A class seven, which is grade seven, a class seven student, this is what the principal

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,560
 of the school said to the newspaper.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,320
 A class seven student was possessed last Thursday and started doing bizarre activities, like

102
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,560
 breaking chairs and shouting loudly.

103
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
 What?

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
 That's your quote?

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,840
 You're like, oh yeah, so sorry about that.

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
 Demonic possession.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
 We're working on it.

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,320
 They send a note home with their parents.

109
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,620
 They're like, if your child exhibits, if your child starts destroying your furniture, please

110
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
 let us know.

111
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,940
 We will take partial responsibility for that.

112
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,060
 And we're going to have a priest show up and start blessing our school.

113
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,260
 Now in India, they have a specific type of priest called, this is pretty dope name for

114
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,900
 a priest, a jag, a jagar, a jagaraya, jagaraya.

115
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,140
 So it kind of sounds like a jaguar, jagaraya.

116
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,260
 Anyways, and they perform a particular form, a ritual called the jagar.

117
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,960
 It actually doesn't sound good.

118
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,360
 It sounds like jack off, but the jaguar, whatever, the jaguar shows up, this giant half man, half

119
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,240
 cat shows up at the school and he goes, okay, I'm going to bless this classroom, this grade

120
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,440
 seven classroom, because that's where I think it started with this girl, but I think the

121
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,280
 girl got it from this classroom.

122
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,560
 So he does the ritual and it's totally fine, but he also says the grade eight classrooms

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,640
 is off as well.

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,000
 So let's be preemptive here.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,460
 We're going to go to grade eight classroom and ward off all the spirits there.

126
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,540
 Now they actually, because this is all fairly recent, they actually had to put like some

127
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,940
 blessing item in the grade seven classroom and the grade eight classroom apparently was

128
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,420
 so bad, even though nothing had happened yet, they had to move the entire grade eight class

129
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,820
 to another wing of the school because that one was just soaked in demonic stuff, according

130
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
 to the jaguars.

131
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,620
 So anyways, the principal goes, the principal is like 10 toes deep in this possession stuff.

132
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,240
 Like obviously he's mentioned it to a reporter and he's the one who brought the priest in

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,760
 and he goes, I have a question for you though.

134
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
 Why is it, why are you called a jaguar?

135
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
 Because like I'm not called a jaguar.

136
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
 That's a mispronunciation.

137
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,440
 The principal's like, okay, second question.

138
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,200
 Why, why would these girls get possessed?

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,720
 Like what happened that can make a possession happen here?

140
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
 And the jaguar says, you know what, here's the thing.

141
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,160
 It could be something like sometimes spirits lie dormant for up to 20 years.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,700
 So it's not like one of the girls brought it in or something like some traumatic event

143
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,500
 happened a couple of nights ago, like someone was murdered or raped or any horrible thing

144
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 happened and then the spirit just happened to latch on to this girl.

145
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,020
 Oh, I should say that after the jaguar showed up, the girls were totally fine.

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,560
 It totally forgot about their work.

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,180
 So all the girls are, he's not just asking these questions, doing this backstory as these

148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,020
 girls are jumping around in the background.

149
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,860
 They've all been cured when the jaguar guys showed up, they all got cured.

150
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,760
 But anyways, he's back to our backstory here.

151
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,440
 He's telling the priest he goes, a demon or a ghost can be here.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,720
 Could have, something bad could happen here 20 years ago.

153
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,740
 And the ghost, it took that long for the ghost to be activated.

154
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,280
 So that's that, right?

155
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
 Well you would think so because the girls are doing fine and the place is warded off

156
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,600
 now from evil.

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
 But like you would guess, like I know a lot of skeptics listen to this show.

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,220
 I think most of my listeners are kind of where I'm at, where you're skeptical but you want

159
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,140
 to believe in this stuff and you just can't accept it in whole cloth because you know

160
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,100
 most of it's lunacy.

161
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,260
 So when you hear a story like this, you're like, could be a demon?

162
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
 Maybe.

163
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,220
 Because you want to believe in that stuff like I do.

164
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,420
 But the skeptical side of you says it's probably wasn't, it was most likely something else.

165
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,460
 Well you have this principle going around telling the newspaper that a girl got possessed but

166
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,960
 don't worry they brought in this spiritual healer and don't worry about your kids.

167
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,320
 We moved them to another wing.

168
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,260
 The school board or the equivalent of the school board in India is not happy with this

169
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,540
 principle right now.

170
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,360
 They're like, first off, nobody was possessed.

171
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,000
 You can't go around telling newspapers people were possessed.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Secondly, demons aren't real.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,520
 Like you can't like, you can't make statements like that.

174
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,120
 You can't bring, the principle was like, hey man, I got the problem solved.

175
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,080
 Like whether or not you believed in it, I brought in this holy leader and he did this

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,620
 ritual and the girls aren't freaking out anymore.

177
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,220
 And the school board's basically like, it's not the point.

178
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,980
 Like we don't know what caused this.

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,620
 It could have been a whole host of mental issues or chemical leak or whatever.

180
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,200
 And the fact that it stopped when this guy showed up doesn't prove that it was a demon.

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,140
 It proves that whatever was causing it stopped causing it.

182
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,280
 So he's like basically like, I don't think he was fired but he definitely was being looked

183
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,940
 at with a very, very critical eye after this.

184
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,280
 Because you have a school administrator who's supposed to be teaching, supposed to be in

185
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,520
 charge of people's education, having stone age beliefs.

186
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,400
 Like having the belief, and more like middle ages beliefs, but you get where I'm going.

187
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,160
 Like you have someone who's in charge of educating the next generation of Indian children, being

188
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,720
 like spooky ghosts, look out guys.

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,920
 Some things you want to get you, you'll be sitting in your class and demon get you.

190
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,840
 I don't know, but I'll get this guy as our back.

191
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,960
 Like then, and the school board is like, you can't talk about that stuff.

192
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,420
 But the end result is everything's fine now.

193
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,020
 I mean that guy might be hanging on his job by a thread.

194
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,300
 But everything's fine now, the kids are fine, the school has been blessed and so on and so

195
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,500
 forth.

196
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:31,100
 But you have these young women who, you have this young woman who starts acting uncontrollably

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,340
 and then when others show up to help her, it's spread to them.

198
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,580
 It didn't spread to all the girls in the classroom.

199
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,940
 The other 14 girls apparently from what I can gather were also interacting with those

200
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,160
 original five, with those original six.

201
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,780
 The first girl and then the five and then it spread to 14 other girls who were also

202
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,500
 interacting with them, almost like some sort of virus.

203
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,600
 So other girls in the classroom weren't coming down with it.

204
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,540
 It was all being connected to patient zero.

205
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:06,380
 So if this was a demonic activity, this was basically a low level rage virus.

206
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,320
 These girls became uncontrollable and violent very, very quickly.

207
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,180
 And they did say, the Jaguar said, this only would have gotten worse.

208
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,540
 This only would have gotten worse if I didn't come in.

209
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,820
 So you have to wonder what would have happened if the skeptics in the community, the school

210
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,700
 board was like, no, they're just acting, it's just made up, it's just mass hysteria.

211
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,780
 Let's send them to a mental institution.

212
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,980
 Let's send them somewhere else so it's suspended them.

213
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,140
 They're just doing this thing.

214
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,940
 It has nothing to do with demons.

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,740
 You have these 19 girls sent away to different asylums or sent away to different psychiatrists

216
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,400
 or sent away just to stay at home.

217
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,800
 And would you have seen this thing spread as more and more women, nurses and doctors

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,480
 and mental health workers and mothers and sisters interacted with these girls for periods

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,640
 of time?

220
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,000
 Would you have seen this thing spread throughout India?

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
 Unlikely, maybe.

222
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
 But we don't know.

223
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,760
 We really don't know what caused it or how it ended.

224
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,380
 But if it was demonic, it could have been the start of some sort of female rage virus

225
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,780
 where no one would be safe.

226
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,140
 Well, at least no one's furniture would ever be safe across the planet.

227
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,820
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

228
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,620
 Now our next story is one of those stories that I heard about years ago and it's always

229
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,980
 kind of stuck with me.

230
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,060
 It's always kind of stuck with me.

231
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,860
 I find it a very intriguing story of how quickly things in your life can go wrong.

232
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,920
 And you're thinking, "Jason, I know how bad things can get in life.

233
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,000
 I've been dumped by my girlfriend and I got yelled at by my boss and I didn't do good

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,600
 on a test in school and I know how quickly."

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,360
 But those tend to happen because things are out of our control.

236
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,840
 The story I'm going to tell you now is fascinating because we're going to follow a group of people

237
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,920
 who over the course of about 18 days make bad decision after bad decision after bad decision

238
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,060
 and how everything ends up playing out.

239
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,340
 Very, very fascinating story.

240
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,980
 On April 12th, 1996, we are in Fort Myers, Florida.

241
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,100
 1996, I graduated in 1994.

242
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
 Music was awesome.

243
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,540
 Britney Spears was topping the charts or maybe not.

244
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,100
 But she was around.

245
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
 She existed in 1994.

246
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,140
 She still exists now.

247
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,100
 But anyways, music was cool.

248
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,460
 Sega Genesis rocked the world.

249
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,360
 The Dreamcast disaster was a few years away.

250
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,800
 And actually that's going to play a part in the story, oddly enough.

251
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,320
 I was just trying to build a pop culture landscape, but that actually is important.

252
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,440
 So in Fort Myers, Florida, in 1996, you had three friends.

253
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
 They were outsiders.

254
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 They were loners.

255
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
 They were considered losers.

256
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,800
 But they were considered losers by the main populace of school among their own subculture

257
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,200
 of the hardcore, like gothic kids who like listen to metal.

258
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,900
 And I know goths don't listen to metal, but I'm trying to describe it how a jock would

259
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,220
 look at these guys.

260
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,100
 These guys were total losers.

261
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,820
 But in their own like subculture, their own dark twisted subculture, they were the leaders.

262
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:20,620
 So you had Kevin Foster, and then you had his two cronies, Pete and Chris.

263
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,060
 And Kevin basically ran the show with these guys.

264
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,840
 He was the cool one.

265
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,660
 He was the one who took charge.

266
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,200
 He was the one who didn't let anyone push him around.

267
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,240
 I was not one of these guys, but when I was reading their story, and like I said, I read

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,880
 it years and years ago, there's a lot of elements that were very familiar to me.

269
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,720
 Just hanging out with your buddies, going to Denny's, going to any restaurant that was

270
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,760
 open 24 hours a day, talking about girls, talking about video games, talking about life

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,480
 and all like how philosophizing you are, even though you're only like 17 or 18 years old.

272
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,760
 You got it all figured out, you know, everything.

273
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,980
 And staying up late at night watching movies, watching MTV, playing video games, hanging

274
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,460
 out with your bros, and you wanted to do two things.

275
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,780
 You wanted to be a crew.

276
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,020
 You wanted to hang out with your buddies, and you wanted to leave your mark on the world.

277
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,500
 As we grow older, you want to hang out with your buddies, you still want it.

278
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,140
 But you start to realize that there are, most people don't leave their mark on the world,

279
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:27,680
 and sometimes just being a good citizen in your area is mark enough.

280
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,580
 Your legacy is how the lives you affect around you in a good way.

281
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,560
 I've known a lot of people who were involved in gang activity, who did a lot of illegal

282
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,940
 stuff, now have wives and kids own their own business, or a very successful employee for

283
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,080
 somebody else's business, and their legacy is that now they are good people.

284
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,020
 As you get older, you realize those things.

285
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,440
 But back when you're still in high school, you're still thinking, you know, you can blaze

286
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,740
 a burn trail across the world, everyone will remember your name.

287
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,020
 This is pre-Columbine, too.

288
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,980
 This story is pre-Columbine.

289
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,060
 So they didn't have any of these school shoots.

290
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,620
 If this story took place after Columbine, there's no doubt in my mind these guys would have

291
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,180
 attacked their high school.

292
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,380
 But let's go ahead and get into it.

293
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,740
 So Kevin comes up, these guys have been friends for a while.

294
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,360
 Kevin comes up with the idea that we don't have to just be friends.

295
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
 The two guys are like, "Hey, where are you going with this?"

296
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,000
 Kevin's like, "No, I'm not going that way with it."

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But we hang out all the time.

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
 The jocks hate us, the preps hate us, the mimes hate us.

299
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,760
 Every other clique in school hates us, but we are gods.

300
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,920
 And actually, I'm going to give myself a new name.

301
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,080
 My new name is God.

302
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
 That's my gang name.

303
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,920
 And they're like, "Gang name?

304
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,400
 When did we become a gang?"

305
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,660
 And on April 12th, 1996, Kevin Foster said, "Tonight, we're no longer just a group of

306
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
 friends hanging out.

307
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,620
 We are the Lords of Chaos."

308
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,820
 They ended up recruiting two other dudes.

309
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,820
 So at this point, you have five guys in the Lords of Chaos.

310
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,020
 But the three main members are Kevin, Pete, and Chris.

311
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,720
 And what they start off by doing is we got a name called Lords of Chaos.

312
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,900
 We got to live up to that name.

313
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,780
 Even though nobody else knew of this group existing that night, they're like, "We have

314
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
 to live up to this name.

315
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
 We just made them."

316
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,360
 Their symbol was...

317
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,740
 This is very complicated for me to describe because I'm not a mathematician, but you may

318
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,200
 know exactly what it is.

319
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,640
 Kevin ended up getting a question wrong on a math test because he put the null symbol

320
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 or something.

321
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 It's a symbol that means nothing.

322
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,920
 And it's two sets of parentheses.

323
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,600
 And in the middle is the null symbol.

324
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,160
 So it's a zero with a line through it.

325
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,480
 So that was their logo.

326
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,360
 Two sets of parentheses and this logo, this null symbol.

327
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,420
 And that was cool enough to start to get other outsiders interested.

328
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,620
 They ended up getting...

329
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,300
 So they had the three original guys.

330
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,740
 They ended up recruiting up to five more guys.

331
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,940
 But each time another person came in, they were considered a lesson.

332
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,100
 They're more of a hanger on in the group.

333
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,820
 They start off by just vandalizing stuff.

334
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:04,060
 They go out and start knocking over mailboxes, painting on stuff, basically just being a nuisance.

335
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,660
 Then, and you're like, "Oh yeah, dude, these kids are kind of cool.

336
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,900
 They're sticking it to the man.

337
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
 Hold up."

338
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,840
 They're trying to set a church bus on fire.

339
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,160
 And that doesn't work.

340
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
 But they do...

341
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
 I have no idea how they came across this.

342
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,080
 They find a bird cage containing two macaws.

343
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,040
 They set it on fire.

344
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
 And one of them died.

345
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 One of them burned up.

346
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
 I have no idea how the other one...

347
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,840
 The other one is just like huddled in the back of the cage.

348
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
 It's the first...

349
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,800
 That was a gruesome image, but I'm just trying to figure out how a two bird...

350
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 There's two birds in a cage.

351
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,480
 How one even survived that.

352
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 Grace of God?

353
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 I don't know.

354
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,480
 But that crime spree takes place between April 12th and April 17th.

355
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,220
 So these guys aren't wasted in any time.

356
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,740
 Within five days, they're setting stuff on fire.

357
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,740
 They're spray painting stuff.

358
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,160
 They're knocking stuff over.

359
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,100
 And generally, I mean, obviously, it's not like vandals have a timetable, but that seems

360
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,060
 a quick amount of time between a gang being formed to the point where they're burning

361
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,460
 living creatures.

362
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,420
 Very, very quick escalation.

363
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,460
 In that time period, a local newspaper, these guys create so much chaos, so quickly.

364
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,760
 That a local newspaper writes an article about them.

365
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,240
 So this is great.

366
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,120
 Kevin's loving this stuff.

367
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
 He has got the attention of the normies.

368
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,040
 And in this article, though, they don't know who the vandals are.

369
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,480
 They don't know who's setting stuff on fire.

370
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,320
 They just know that this bird got cooked and there's this vandalism around this church

371
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 buzz.

372
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,600
 All this stuff's being attacked around Fort Myers.

373
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,680
 Seems completely random, but petty.

374
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,540
 In the newspaper, they're called "obviously P-brained vandals" and "persons of less

375
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,140
 than average intelligence and a Cretan's personality."

376
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,140
 So to someone like Kevin, who named himself God, who considers himself this arch enemy

377
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,140
 of good things and order, again, preceding Heath Ledger's Joker, this guy is, I can't

378
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,740
 imagine how off the rocker he would be post-Columbine, post-Heath Ledger's Joker.

379
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,960
 I think he would have gone ten times worse than we're going with it.

380
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,080
 But when he sees the newspaper responding to his violent acts, he's like, "Yes!"

381
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,260
 But then when he reads how stupid they think he is, all those insults he got throughout

382
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,640
 high school are coming back.

383
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
 I think at this point he's 19.

384
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,120
 I believe at this point he's graduated high school, but his cronies are still in high

385
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
 school.

386
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
 April 17th, he writes a manifesto.

387
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,340
 He writes a manifesto called "Declaration of War," a formal introduction of Lords of

388
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,840
 Chaos.

389
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,700
 Talk about some edgelord nonsense.

390
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,940
 Like obviously these guys are just so full of themselves.

391
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,140
 This is what the manifesto said.

392
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,540
 This is part of it.

393
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,980
 Lee County, that's the county that Fort Myers is in.

394
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,900
 I hear I'll read it in Kevin's voice.

395
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,500
 How I imagine Kevin's voice to be.

396
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,840
 Lee County is dealing with a formidable foe.

397
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,780
 With high caliber intelligence, balls of titanium alloy, and a wicked destructive streak.

398
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,740
 Be prepared for destruction of biblical proportions, for this is the coming of a new god whose

399
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,140
 fiery hand shall lay waste to the populace.

400
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:15,140
 The games have just begun, and terror shall ensue.

401
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,060
 So obviously this guy's completely delusional, but I'm sure when he was writing this he

402
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,760
 thought it was the most badass thing possible.

403
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,600
 Like if a movie villain said those lines in "If Thanos talked like that you'd roll your

404
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 eyes."

405
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 You'd be like "Oh my god."

406
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,080
 When did Thanos start cutting himself?

407
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,000
 Because that's really just such edgy, hot topic nonsense.

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,640
 But he writes this, him and his guys think this is totally badass dude, and they end

409
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,720
 up not even sending it.

410
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,800
 Three days later, April 20th.

411
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,840
 Now he wanted to show, Kevin came up with this idea, he goes "You know what?

412
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,060
 It's a chaos, ready to declare war."

413
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,540
 I know he wrote that declaration in the senate and anyone, but that doesn't matter.

414
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,980
 War has still been declared.

415
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:02,100
 And in solidarity with Waco and the Oklahoma City Bombing, see these were their inspirations.

416
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
 Let's blow something up.

417
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,260
 We're gonna do this in solidarity with them.

418
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,860
 Now both of those events happened on April 19th, so they were a day late, but the spirit

419
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,860
 was there.

420
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,160
 I was there with you in spirit, David Kressh, I was there in you as spirit, Timothée McVeigh.

421
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,280
 So and his co-conspirators who they, Oklahoma City Bombing is one of those conspiracy theories

422
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,760
 that I don't think it was just those two guys.

423
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,800
 Who was it, Timothée McVeigh and Nichols I think was the other dude?

424
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,960
 I think there were other people involved in that.

425
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,440
 I actually should cover that.

426
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,240
 Oklahoma City Bombing is actually one of those conspiracy theories I think is a bigger conspiracy.

427
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,800
 I personally believe that Al Cata was involved in that.

428
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,640
 We'll talk about that on a later episode.

429
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,300
 Anyways, yeah, very interesting topic actually.

430
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,500
 But again, back to this interesting topic as well.

431
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 I love this story.

432
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,780
 This story stuck with me for years.

433
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,780
 They actually find in their area there is a Coca-Cola bottling plant which was named

434
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,500
 like a historic landmark.

435
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,700
 It was no longer in operation.

436
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,820
 These teenagers bring in, admittedly this part's funny, they bring in all of these propane

437
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,820
 tanks and set them up around this abandoned factory and the fuse is a Pepsi can.

438
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,000
 And I'm like, okay, I gotta give credit where credit's due.

439
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,160
 Blowing up a Coca-Cola plant with a Pepsi can.

440
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,560
 It wasn't, they just didn't roll a Pepsi can in there and it exploded like they packed

441
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,040
 a full of gunpowder and put the wick in and all that stuff.

442
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,320
 But that was a fuse.

443
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,960
 And these kids actually pull it off.

444
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
 The bomb rips through the abandoned factory on the night of April 20th.

445
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,440
 And it does $100,000 worth in damage.

446
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,080
 And that's $100,000 in 1996.

447
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,880
 That's a lot of money.

448
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,420
 Probably like $200,000. It's not a ton of money, but it's a lot of money for a group

449
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,540
 of idiot kids to do.

450
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
 You have these eight kids.

451
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,540
 And really it was just the three at this point doing this.

452
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,940
 I think there were two hangarons at this point.

453
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,380
 The other three were at home playing Sega Genesis.

454
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,780
 But they were still considered members of the Lords of Chaos.

455
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,820
 So they still reveled in this act of destruction.

456
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,500
 At this point, cops are totally looking for these guys.

457
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,540
 The vandalism, kind of looking for them.

458
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,600
 The arson, you had arson investigators looking for them.

459
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,400
 But when they blew up, the police are figuring out that this is most likely connected.

460
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,360
 Police are out in full force looking for these guys.

461
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,960
 And still, six days later, one of the Lords of Chaos says, "I don't like this guy that

462
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,460
 I work with.

463
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,240
 So let's carjack him."

464
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,160
 So we're seeing this level of, you have, again, one of the other fascinating things about the

465
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,760
 story is you have basically this, I think you can see where this story is going.

466
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,220
 You have this ramp up that we usually see take years, take place in a matter of weeks,

467
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,460
 of days.

468
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,780
 Vandalism to arson, to killing a living thing, to blowing up an empty building.

469
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,620
 That's enough escalation there.

470
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,740
 Now they're sticking guns in people's faces and dragging them out of cars.

471
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,100
 The level of violence is raising.

472
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,460
 This organization was just formed on April 12.

473
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,300
 14 days later, they're sticking a gun in someone's face.

474
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,940
 Get out of your car.

475
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,320
 April 30th, 1996.

476
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,200
 The Grad Night is coming up.

477
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,680
 And Grad Night's at Disney World, which is one of the great things about going to a school

478
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,400
 around a theme park is your Grad Nights are probably always going to be awesome.

479
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,240
 And Kevin comes up with an idea.

480
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,400
 We are all going to crash Grad Night, but we got to have nice clothes to do.

481
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,960
 We can't be wearing these grungy clothes with all this dark imagery and stuff like that,

482
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
 all these chains.

483
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,720
 Let's get some nice clothes.

484
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,880
 We'll sneak into Grad Night.

485
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,540
 The other guys are like, "We can just buy tickets."

486
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,260
 He goes, "You guys just buy tickets if you're actually graduating this year."

487
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,620
 "I already graduated."

488
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,220
 So I'm going to go with you.

489
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,660
 We're going to sneak into the Grad Night.

490
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,180
 Then I'm going to steal a Disney character's costume.

491
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,060
 Again, super elaborate Joker level stuff.

492
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:56,060
 I'm going to steal a Disney character's costume, come in with a shotgun, a couple of firearms,

493
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,400
 and I'm going to shoot every minority that I see.

494
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,480
 That was his end game, which would have been absolutely shocking if he could have pulled

495
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,860
 it off, obviously.

496
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,360
 That would have been horrible.

497
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,620
 A guy in a Mickey Mouse costume running around just blowing minorities away would have totally

498
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,260
 changed a lot of things in 1996.

499
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,240
 It would change stuff now, but we've had so many mass shootings that unfortunately we've

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
 started to be like blah.

501
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,620
 But in 1996, it would have been a brand new phenomenon.

502
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,520
 And adding in the theatrics to it would have just shocked people.

503
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,320
 Obviously they weren't able to get away with it because what happens was they couldn't

504
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
 even steal the clothes.

505
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,800
 So you have these guys that are actually pretty good at committing violence, but all other

506
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,840
 crimes they suck at.

507
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,280
 They got a smoke grenade from an army surplus store.

508
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,960
 They went into a retail store to get some clothes pulled to pin on the grenade, chucked

509
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
 it.

510
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,720
 They didn't go off, so they didn't have the smoke cover, so they weren't able to crash

511
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,260
 the grenade.

512
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,200
 But what they do is they can't steal the clothes.

513
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,780
 So they say, "You know what we should do?

514
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,880
 Let's just go to the high school and just trash it.

515
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,460
 Let's trash the high school."

516
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,580
 So they break them in the high school and they tried starting a fire.

517
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
 Didn't work.

518
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,460
 They're pretty 50/50 on their stuff.

519
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,500
 They do end up stealing some stuff from the high school.

520
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,140
 This is something only high schoolers steal because they want to have the thrill of the

521
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
 steal.

522
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,820
 Latex gloves.

523
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,980
 You can't buy those.

524
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,280
 A fire extinguisher, two staplers, and a bag of canned peaches.

525
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,920
 So I'm imagining it's just a bag with a bunch of canned peaches in it, because otherwise

526
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,560
 that's kind of an oxymoron, a bag of canned peaches.

527
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,560
 But they successfully steal this stuff while they get it out of the building I was in.

528
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,320
 They come outside and right then as they're standing outside the school, their band director,

529
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,040
 Mark Schwebes, pulls up in his car.

530
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,920
 And he's like, "What are you guys doing here?

531
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,440
 It's late at night.

532
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
 We don't have class.

533
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
 You're not in the band.

534
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,740
 I recognize you two."

535
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,840
 He didn't recognize Kevin.

536
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,460
 He didn't recognize Peter, Chris, but he recognized two of the other Lords of Chaos.

537
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,860
 And he says, "I recognize you guys.

538
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,740
 And I don't know what you guys went up to, but I know those aren't your canned peaches."

539
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,940
 So he takes the peaches and the fire extinguisher, and Mark Schwebes turns to them and says,

540
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,460
 "You two that I recognize?"

541
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,820
 Again, I don't know you guys.

542
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,260
 You guys aren't giving me your names, but you two?

543
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,740
 Expect to call from the police tomorrow.

544
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,400
 He throws the stuff in his car and drives away.

545
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,920
 Now Mark Schwebes is a young man.

546
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 He's 32.

547
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 32 years old.

548
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 He's a band director.

549
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,000
 And he's not thinking anything of it.

550
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,640
 Some hooligan kids broken to the school.

551
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
 He didn't know they started fire, had no idea who these guys were.

552
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,080
 Just recognized two of them from school.

553
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:46,240
 But as he's driving away, Kevin looks at him and says, "Someone's gotta die tonight."

554
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,640
 They go to the house.

555
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,700
 His name is unlisted, but they're able to find him his address in a phone book or some

556
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,860
 sort of phone directory.

557
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,100
 They go to his house and Kevin has a shotgun.

558
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,740
 And you have three kids who show up at the shooting.

559
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,540
 One is driving.

560
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,140
 One's job is to knock on the door and Kevin is going to shoot him.

561
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,060
 It's late at night.

562
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,260
 Mark Schwebes hears a knock.

563
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:13,060
 He comes to the door and right when the door opens, gets shot right in the face with a shotgun

564
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,980
 killed instantly.

565
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,280
 Oddly enough, and actually this kind of ended up helping Kevin get away for a bit, he ends

566
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,960
 up rolling the body over and shooting Kevin in the butt, in the butt hole.

567
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,680
 And there was a rumor that Mark was gay.

568
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,080
 He wasn't, but there was a rumor at school that Mark was gay.

569
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,080
 And there was a rumor at school that Mark was caught in some sort of love triangle.

570
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,560
 So the kids leave and when the cops show up, they see a man who was killed instantly with

571
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,880
 a shotgun blast.

572
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,380
 And the shotgun blowed to his butt, to his bottom, made them think it had something to

573
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,700
 do because they didn't immediately go, "Hey, it's that gay teacher."

574
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,300
 And the other guys go, "Oh no, it's just a rumor."

575
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,860
 They start investigating it, trying to figure out what happened.

576
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,460
 And people are like, "Well maybe it was a love triangle.

577
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,620
 You know, I think he was gay and another person was like, "No, he's not gay."

578
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,060
 So the cops actually thought because that second wound seemed so like a sexual revenge

579
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,820
 move, the cops started looking at adult suspects.

580
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,520
 And it's possible, it's unlikely, but they definitely would have gotten away with it

581
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,020
 longer.

582
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,800
 But the Lords of Chaos do what most teenage criminals do, is they start talking.

583
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,840
 And more specifically, someone who wasn't even there that night, who was one of the

584
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,420
 low level hangarons, told his girlfriend, "Oh yeah, I know what happened to Mark.

585
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,320
 I was there that night.

586
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,680
 I was the one who knocked on the door and just bam, got his head blowing off, man.

587
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,640
 And then bam, right in his butt hole."

588
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,140
 Isn't that dope girlfriend?

589
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,780
 And the girlfriend goes, "Yeah, that's totally awesome.

590
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
 You know what?

591
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,160
 I'm gonna go home now."

592
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,860
 She goes home, she goes to sleep, she wakes up the next morning and calls the cops.

593
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,460
 The cops go talk to the kid.

594
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,440
 They quickly find out he wasn't there.

595
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,100
 And within days of that, the kids are all getting round up.

596
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,380
 Now there was the three original and there was five hangarons.

597
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,540
 Now all of them end up getting arrested for things like conspiracy or vandalism.

598
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,640
 They didn't, that was when they finally were able to prove that the Lords of Chaos blew

599
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
 up the Koch factory.

600
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,400
 They kind of have their suspicions, but they weren't 100%.

601
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,920
 But the three main ones, Pete and Kevin and Chris, are all getting charged with murder.

602
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,800
 The lower level Lords of Chaos begin ratting everybody out, testifying against them in court.

603
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,360
 Chris and Pete take plea deals.

604
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,840
 Everyone ends up taking plea deals except for Kevin.

605
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,940
 Pete and Chris get life in prison.

606
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,100
 And Kevin goes to trial and he gets sentenced to death for this crime.

607
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:48,340
 April 12th, this Lords of Chaos gang starts on May 2nd is when their crimes are exposed

608
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,180
 and they get arrested.

609
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,860
 One of the reasons why this story stuck with me so much, and we're gonna wrap it up with

610
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,420
 this, but one of the reasons why this story struck me so much is one, it's so relatable.

611
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,980
 Being an outsider, having your own little group where you guys are the cool ones and

612
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,660
 the rest of them are the norm, I was all like that in high school and stuff.

613
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,960
 I totally relate it to these guys.

614
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,280
 And it blows stuff up.

615
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,720
 It wasn't killing cats or macaws or whatever.

616
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,220
 I wouldn't do any of that stuff.

617
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,920
 But I get the feeling that you're on the outside and it's you against the world.

618
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,160
 So I totally empathized with that beginning of it.

619
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,760
 And I didn't empathize with any of their actions, they're complete idiots.

620
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,240
 Secondly, I don't remember which one it was and I didn't have time to research it, but

621
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,720
 it's kind of, it doesn't matter.

622
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,240
 It was either Chris or Pete.

623
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,020
 One of the guys who wasn't the main driving force, he was just along for the ride.

624
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,460
 Ended up getting life.

625
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
 Like the guy driving the car.

626
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,060
 He didn't pull the trigger, but if you're a part of a felony, you get the murder charge.

627
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,340
 I remember reading at the end of the book, he said, "The only thing I ever wanted to

628
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,980
 do," and I'm paraphrasing here, "but the only thing that I really loved before I got

629
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,100
 involved in the Lord's of Chaos was playing video games."

630
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,460
 And I don't get to play video games anymore.

631
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,100
 And I thought, "You're damn right.

632
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,260
 You are damn right.

633
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,360
 You traded that privilege away when you got involved with these knuckleheads."

634
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,200
 And I know how quickly that can escalate.

635
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,800
 Where it starts off, you're just a bunch of outsiders smoking clothes, cigarettes, talking

636
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 about how the man doesn't understand you.

637
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,720
 And I know how quickly, under the wrong influence, I don't think Chris or Pete, if they were

638
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,760
 involved in any other group, would have done these actions.

639
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,280
 I think that Kevin was responsible for being that guiding force.

640
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,480
 Otherwise they just would have been cool kids, quote, unquote, "cool kids hanging with the

641
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
 group at Denny's."

642
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,860
 I don't think Chris or Pete were necessarily evil, but they got swept up in the evil.

643
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,900
 They got swept up in the evil unbelievably fast because they wanted to belong to something

644
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,460
 so badly, in the end they didn't care what it was.

645
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,940
 Some kids, it's the track and field team.

646
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,380
 Some kids, it's chess club.

647
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,300
 Some kids, it's acting.

648
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,260
 These guys didn't want to do any of that stuff.

649
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,540
 And in an alternate world, that kid who loved video games is serving life in prison.

650
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
 That's our world.

651
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,440
 In an alternate world, that kid's playing Spider-Man for the PS4.

652
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,880
 That kid has his own kids and he's watching his son play Breath of the Wild on Switch.

653
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
 And he's reading, he's watching YouTube coverage of E3 and all that stuff.

654
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,880
 And he traded all of that stuff up, all of that stuff, to be part of a group that in

655
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,000
 the end didn't care about him, that in the end he was just a getaway driver.

656
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,320
 He was just a foot soldier.

657
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,900
 He was just somebody in this group.

658
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:29,700
 He traded away a lifetime of what he loved for fighting against what he hated, or thought

659
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,980
 he hated, for just under three weeks.

660
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,120
 It's very, very easy to get caught up in the darkness.

661
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,360
 And when it latches onto you, it's very, very hard to get it off.

662
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,400
 But at any point, any one of these lords of chaos outside of Kevin, any one of these kids

663
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,200
 could have told Kevin, "You know what?

664
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,620
 I'm done, walked away, and forged a new path in life."

665
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,420
 They didn't.

666
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,860
 They supported Kevin in his murderous act.

667
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,340
 And their lives are over.

668
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,380
 I've always found that story fascinating because it is so relatable.

669
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,980
 It is very, very easy to pick the wrong group to be in.

670
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,940
 But even if you do, you have to have the knowledge.

671
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,660
 It's time to get out.

672
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:40,960
 They had until that knock on that door to walk away.

673
00:35:40,960 --> 00:36:10,760
 They had until that knock on that door to walk away.

674
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:24,440
 They had until that knock on that door to walk away.

675
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,440
 They had until that knock on that door to walk away.

676
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
 They had until that knock on that door to walk away.
