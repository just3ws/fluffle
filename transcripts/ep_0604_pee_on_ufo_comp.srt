1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 When police begin investigating a series of crimes in a small town in Italy, they have

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,960
 no clue they're about to stumble across a disgusting conspiracy.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,940
 And then we take a look at the story I promised you on Friday.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,720
 What happens when a man is abducted by aliens and the first thing he does is unzip his pants

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,280
 and pee all over their UFO today on Ted Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:35,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Ted Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,440
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,940
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,800
 I'm not going to talk this fast the whole episode, so let me slow down a little bit.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
 But we do have a lot of stuff to cover in this episode.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,400
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest feature and supporter, Kyle.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,160
 Everyone give a round of applause to Kyle.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,480
 He's driving like a little clown car, pee-pee-pee, driving around in circles, honking his horn,

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
 stuff like that.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
 It's super loud.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 I can't even record the podcast.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,980
 But it's cool because he's supporting the Patreon.

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,480
 He can drive around all he wants.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,640
 If you can't support the Patreon, you can still drive around as much as you want.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,260
 But you can also help spread the word about the show.

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,760
 That really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,880
 You can't support it financially, supported by helping out with the street team marketing.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,600
 Both are very, very important.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,060
 So Kyle, go ahead.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,800
 You can hop out of that clown car.

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,440
 We're first going to put you in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,240
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,420
 We are headed out to a small town in Italy.

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,420
 Brrrrrrr.

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
 Brrrrrrr.

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,440
 Now, I'm gonna say, first off, this story was recommended to me by Fabio.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,140
 Fabio Nurbon, he's actually at this point our Italian correspondent, sent a ton of great

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,500
 stuff over from Italy.

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,480
 The family that was doing the Ouija board and got possessed, that was a great one.

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
 He sent me this story.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 It hats off to you.

39
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,280
 I also gotta say this though, before we get there, Kyle doesn't have a choice.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
 He's piling the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,780
 This first story is gonna make you mad.

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,640
 This first story is really gonna piss you guys off.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,520
 It really pisses me off.

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,280
 So I recommend sticking around because I think it's an important story, but if you have any

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
 pitchforks nearby, lock them up for now.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
 Put them in a time to save.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,240
 If you haven't lived anywhere near this town in Italy, you might want to drive away from

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 it.

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,320
 Get away from it so you can't get back anytime soon.

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
 Let's go here.

51
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,000
 So as the Dead Rabbit Durgible is descending, it's the year 2018.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,760
 We're headed to Bibiano.

53
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,120
 We're headed to Bibiano in Italy.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
 Dead Rabbit Durgible.

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,160
 Kyle is driving it through the clouds.

56
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,760
 Clouds are starting to get gray and dark.

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
 It's 2018.

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,000
 Kyle lands the Dead Rabbit Durgible outside of this clinic and we walk in and we're standing

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
 behind a two-way mirror.

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,360
 Or is it a one-way mirror?

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 Which one's a regular mirror?

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 I think it's a two-way mirror.

63
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,840
 We're just looking at reflections of ourselves.

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,760
 You gotta get the jokes in now because the story gets grim.

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,200
 We're looking through a window.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,440
 Other people can't see us is what it is.

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,840
 And we're standing there in our lab coats and on the other side there's a child psychologist

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,240
 and there's a little girl there.

69
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
 I'll say she's like 10.

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,040
 And the child psychologist who's sitting there and the girl's crying, "Why can't I see my

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
 daddy?"

72
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,600
 You're like, "Jason, that's not the voice of a 10-year-old girl.

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
 That's six.

74
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 Fine.

75
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 She's six.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
 Why can't I see my daddy?"

77
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,600
 The girl says.

78
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,880
 And then the child psychologist says, "Don't you remember?

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
 Don't you remember?

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,600
 You don't want to see him.

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,160
 You said you didn't want to see him anymore.

82
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,880
 I remember you telling me you don't want to see him anymore."

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,880
 And the little girl's sitting there and she goes, "I didn't say that.

84
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
 No.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
 I didn't say that."

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
 And the child psychologist goes, "Yes, you did.

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
 You said you didn't want to see him anymore because you were afraid that he would hurt

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
 you.

89
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
 Remember?

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
 Do you remember that?

91
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,840
 You said that he was going to hurt you and if you saw him again, maybe he'd get mad.

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,680
 And he'd seek out vengeance.

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,440
 Do you remember how much you feared your father?

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,160
 Don't you remember?"

95
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,960
 And the little girl's sitting there and she just begins sobbing because she doesn't remember.

96
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,400
 She doesn't remember that at all.

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,760
 Now what I just read you, I changed a little bit of the lines or that's pretty much verbatim

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
 quotes that were said between this little girl and this child psychologist.

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,640
 Now the police kept getting called into this town because they kept getting reports of

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,560
 children being abused by their families.

101
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,200
 And this was happening so much to the police.

102
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 They're like, "Oh, great.

103
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,080
 They'd see Bibiano on the caller ID.

104
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,160
 They're like, "Ugh, another one of these."

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
 They would go out and there'd be a family and they'd say, "No, I didn't abuse my kids.

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
 I've never touched my kids.

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
 Like, sure, maybe I'll yell at them every once in a while.

108
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,160
 Shouldn't have admitted that, but I'm not hurting my kids."

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
 And the cops would say, "Listen, we're getting these complaints.

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 People are saying this.

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
 We're going to have your kid taken into the foster system."

112
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
 And parents are freaking out.

113
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,240
 They're like, "We're totally innocent.

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,440
 We didn't do anything."

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,640
 Child would be removed from the home, placed into the foster system.

116
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
 The parents would be investigated.

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,520
 But what happened was the police kept coming out here.

118
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,760
 They kept running these investigations and over a matter of a couple months, eventually

119
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 the police all got together and they go, "There's a lot of people being falsely accused of abusing

120
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,880
 their children in this town.

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
 A lot of them."

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,840
 So that's when the police started Operation Angels and Demons.

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,920
 This is what they found out.

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,880
 This was really infuriating.

125
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,360
 The mayor of the town, allegedly, allegedly, the mayor of the town, a couple of local doctors,

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,200
 a couple of local child psychologists, and friends of theirs, families that they knew

127
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,520
 in this town, had come up with this scheme.

128
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
 So here was this scheme.

129
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,440
 This is what they were doing.

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,600
 They were going and finding families that were already in a bit of distress.

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,560
 So maybe the dad had a drinking problem.

132
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
 Maybe they were just poor.

133
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,760
 Maybe they didn't have all the nicest clothes and everyone in school made fun of them.

134
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,680
 The mayor of the town's like, "Ah, look at that guy.

135
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
 He's wearing crummy jeans."

136
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,240
 They would find these families that weren't the best family to begin with.

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,600
 But sometimes it could just be that they didn't have a lot of money.

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,440
 They would then make a report that those children were being abused and the police would come

139
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,240
 in and they would separate the children from the household.

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,920
 Once the psychologists and once the doctors got ahold of the children, they forged drawings

141
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,160
 that made it look like a little kid drew them of a sexual nature.

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,320
 Then they would have these drawings and they could present them to the police and go, "This

143
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,240
 is what Sally drew."

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,200
 Once she dropped her off in this office, we asked her what was going on and she drew

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 this picture.

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,360
 Completely forged drawings to make it look like a kid did it.

147
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,840
 They then did this weird thing too where they'd say, "Let's pretend, let's put on a play.

148
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,960
 Let's put on a play with about you."

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 The kids are like, "What?

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 This is so weird.

151
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,680
 I just want to go home and see my parents."

152
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,880
 The psychologists would pretend they'd go, "You pretend to be you and I'll pretend to

153
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,720
 be your parents."

154
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,360
 Then they would be mean to them pretending as they were their parents.

155
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,120
 Sometimes they would dress up as like the wicked witch of the West and be like, "I'm

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
 your mommy.

157
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
 Remember me?

158
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
 I'm your mommy."

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
 They would be super mean to the kid.

160
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,920
 They were not nine.

161
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
 I kind of high-balled it in the beginning.

162
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,680
 This would be really effective on someone below the age of six, this mental torment, and then

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,520
 if that didn't work.

164
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,920
 No joke, this happened in 2018.

165
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,440
 If that didn't work, or even if it did work and they just wanted to take it to the next

166
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,080
 level, they had what was known as the Lil Memory Machine.

167
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,440
 Lil Memory Machine.

168
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,720
 It was an electroshock therapy machine where they were shocking these children and giving

169
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,160
 them false memories of sexual abuse by their own parents.

170
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,720
 What was the point of all this?

171
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,280
 Was it some sick fetish thing?

172
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
 Maybe.

173
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
 But what we do know, what the police believe it is, money.

174
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,600
 They were selling these children to these other homes.

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,280
 So you take a kid from a house that was disadvantaged, but even if they were alcoholic parents, that's

176
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,440
 bad, but that's not sexually abusing these kids.

177
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,960
 I've known parents who are alcoholics and they're really, really bad parents and they

178
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
 would never do this type of stuff.

179
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,240
 But can you imagine having your kids taken away because of that?

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
 And you know it's not true.

181
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
 And the kids knew it wasn't true.

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
 This little girl goes, "That never happened.

183
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,400
 I'm not afraid to see my dad.

184
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
 What are you talking about?"

185
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,280
 The only reason why this blew up was because the police realized they were investigating

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,880
 all of these claims and they were false.

187
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,960
 They're investigating all of these families and they're not finding any proof, but these

188
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,280
 kids are now in these foster homes.

189
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,240
 They were selling the children to friends of theirs.

190
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,480
 And to make this even worse, if this story could get even worse, some of the kids were

191
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,120
 removed from their home under false pretenses that the children were being sexually abused

192
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,280
 by their parents.

193
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
 They were removed into foster homes.

194
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,240
 They were sexually abused in their foster homes.

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
 It's infuriating.

196
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,880
 This story is infuriating.

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,800
 And it's funny because you think, is it just like some urban legend?

198
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,560
 This was actually discussed in the European Union Parliament.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,360
 This was a huge issue and it's been completely just disappeared.

200
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,480
 The last thing that they had a couple articles come out in June, I believe, of 2018 when

201
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
 the story first broke.

202
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,720
 And then when the European Union Parliament, they had a like a side meeting about it, about

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,480
 you know, how can we prevent this in the future?

204
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
 That meeting was in 2019, nothing since.

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,040
 We don't know if how the trial proceeded.

206
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,280
 We don't know if the charges were like stuck to these people.

207
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,640
 We don't know if they're in jail or if they've been able to avoid it.

208
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
 We don't know.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
 But it's not some weird urban legend.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
 I'm saying allegedly because legally none of this has been proven, but the story itself

211
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
 took place.

212
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,560
 Whether the people who were arrested are actually guilty, that's for the courts to decide if

213
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
 they decide it.

214
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
 These would be powerful people, the mayor of town.

215
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,320
 But I wouldn't be shocked if this story has just disappeared at this point.

216
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 I haven't found any information on it.

217
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,840
 I was using, I looked, Fabio from what I could gather didn't find any additional information

218
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
 on it as well.

219
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
 He sent me over some stuff.

220
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,240
 I wouldn't be surprised if all these charges have just disappeared.

221
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,560
 These were powerful people who were breaking the law and those are the hardest people to

222
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,960
 convict.

223
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,800
 You know, for every O.J. Simpson, that's a bad example, he got off.

224
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,720
 But for every powerful person that does actually burning, for every Bernie made off, there's

225
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,960
 a thousand other people who are able to just buy, Jeffrey Epstein got out of jail the first

226
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
 time.

227
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,480
 So, you know, it's just infuriating that this stuff happens.

228
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,520
 So Kyle, let's go ahead and leave behind the town of Bibiano, Italy.

229
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,360
 Call in that carbonar copter.

230
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,320
 We, this is just a gross down sorry if you guys live there, but you might want to at

231
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 least vote this mayor out.

232
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,920
 It's a legend, maybe they didn't really do it, but I don't know.

233
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,920
 At a certain point you just kind of got a strike on your shoulders and say, hopefully

234
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
 these guys got what they deserved.

235
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,000
 Kyle is now in the cockpit of the carbonar copter.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,480
 We are headed out to High Point, New Jersey.

237
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
 It's September 1985 and there's a young man, he's camping by himself all in the woods.

238
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,880
 We'll call him Chuck, which may actually be his real name.

239
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 We'll get to that in a little bit.

240
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
 But Chuck, it's midnight too.

241
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
 I forgot to add that.

242
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,200
 Don't add the mood, it's super spooky.

243
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,240
 The sun is gone and you guys know what night time is.

244
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,800
 Chuck is sleeping in his tent.

245
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,680
 He hears the owl outside and like squirrels.

246
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,080
 I guess they're sleeping too.

247
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
 It's night time.

248
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,320
 So he hears little squirrels snoring.

249
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
 Doing that.

250
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,160
 And then he notices something.

251
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,320
 He hears the sounds of the forest getting quieter.

252
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
 I can't make a quiet owl.

253
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,680
 But what he imagines is, not what he imagines, well maybe he imagined it, but what he hears

254
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,320
 is he heard the owl and then he's getting farther and farther away from the owl.

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
 Now he's sleeping in his tent and he's like, huh, what, this is weird.

256
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,680
 Sound doesn't normally work like this.

257
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
 Even though he's perfectly still, he hears the sound of the owl getting farther and

258
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
 farther away.

259
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,440
 And he starts like trying to get up and he realizes there's no ground underneath the

260
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,940
 tent.

261
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
 He's like, what?

262
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,360
 I assume, I assume he said that.

263
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,240
 I assume he immediately panicked.

264
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,120
 He realizes then that the tent and everything in it, including him, is floating off of the

265
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,720
 ground.

266
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,680
 And then all of a sudden the tent stops floating.

267
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,920
 Now that would be a cause to panic, obviously, if you're in an airplane and it stops flying,

268
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,880
 it stops doing the thing it needs to do to stay afloat.

269
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
 You would be panicked.

270
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
 But he's not.

271
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,020
 He's panicked, but he's not falling.

272
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,980
 At least he's panicked on something.

273
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,300
 The tent he can now feel is on solid ground again.

274
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,780
 So maybe he, you know, had some bad food before he's having food poisoning.

275
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,820
 Is that what happens when you get food poisoning?

276
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,540
 He feel like you're flying up whenever you get food poisoning.

277
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,540
 You can't hear owls.

278
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,940
 Isn't that a symptom?

279
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,860
 He unzips the tent and he crawls out and the first thing that happens, thunk, thunk, thunk

280
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
 his hand.

281
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,100
 Like Jason, I have no idea what that sound effect so is to me.

282
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,800
 His hand reaches out of the tent and it hits metal.

283
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,300
 Like metal grating.

284
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,400
 Now you know the sound effect.

285
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 Duh.

286
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 Duh.

287
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Next hand hits the grating.

288
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 Duh.

289
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
 He's crawling out.

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,360
 You're like Jason, plus he is also made of metal.

291
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,880
 That's not what it would sound like if you're crawling on a metal grate.

292
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,720
 He realizes that he's in a metal room.

293
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,040
 He is no longer in the forest.

294
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,360
 He's no longer floating in the air.

295
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
 He's in a metal room.

296
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,300
 And it's filled with fog.

297
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:14,900
 He's looking there and through the fog he sees a man wearing a gray uniform.

298
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,980
 Now Chuck does what is really the only sensible thing right now.

299
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,500
 He just crawls back into the tent.

300
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 Right?

301
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,900
 There's really not much you can do at this point.

302
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
 You would go, you would crawl into the tent.

303
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 It'd be kind of shocking.

304
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,960
 But then you'd go back out and be like, hey buddy, what's up?

305
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,060
 Like he would definitely find the heaviest object in your tent.

306
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,480
 Which might just be your fists.

307
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,360
 But you would confront the guy.

308
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,920
 Because other, what are you going to do to stay in there for the rest of your life?

309
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,680
 Well Chuck doesn't do either of those things.

310
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,840
 Stay in there for the rest of his life.

311
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,280
 This isn't creepypasta that we're making up.

312
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
 He didn't die in there.

313
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,040
 He also doesn't come out and confront the stranger.

314
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,780
 At a certain point he's in the tent for a while and he goes, I have to pee.

315
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,820
 I got to pee man.

316
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,140
 So you can pee in your tent.

317
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,620
 You can pee in a cup.

318
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,980
 You're thinking of other places you can pee other than what he's about to do.

319
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,700
 And I've given it away in the intro of the episode.

320
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,820
 He crawls out of the tent.

321
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,780
 So now he's in a mist filled metal room somewhere.

322
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
 He doesn't see the gray stranger.

323
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,700
 He doesn't see the gray uniform stranger when he crawls back out.

324
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,500
 But somewhere in the mist.

325
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,760
 You have to imagine there is a man in a gray uniform.

326
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,640
 Just because you can't see him doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

327
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
 You're not a toddler.

328
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,200
 He probably still is there.

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
 But Chuck is like, dude I really got to pee man.

330
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
 My back teeth are floating.

331
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,920
 So he unzips his pants and begins peeing in a UFO.

332
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,120
 Which is amazing.

333
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,280
 In all of my years of researching UFO stuff, I don't think I've ever even come across anyone

334
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
 having any.

335
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,560
 You guys can correct me.

336
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,080
 I may have talked about it on the show, but have people ever pooped on a UFO?

337
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,740
 There was the story about the little boy kidnapped by the bears in the national park.

338
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,460
 His grandma was a robot and he pooped on a piece of paper for his grandma.

339
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,260
 You're like, Jason you've never covered that on the show.

340
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,260
 It's actually really well known.

341
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,540
 I'll try to put it in the show notes.

342
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,420
 I've never covered it because it's actually one of the most well known like missing 411

343
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
 stories.

344
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,820
 But you had a boy poop on a piece of paper for that.

345
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,660
 And I'm sure I've talked about bodily waste and menstrual blood and stuff like that due

346
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,440
 to UFOs experimenting on people.

347
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,480
 But I can think of another time where someone's actually willingly peed or pooped in a UFO.

348
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
 But this guy's doing it.

349
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
 He's breaking all sorts of boundaries.

350
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,360
 Now he could have just, sometimes when you have to pee, you know how you just do the

351
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,080
 bare amount of pee.

352
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,000
 Like you're watching something really good on television and you can't pause it.

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
 So you run and you just pee just enough so the pain goes away and then you run back out

354
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
 and you go, "What I miss?"

355
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
 Is there's a huge wet spot on your pants?

356
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,080
 Don't tell me you guys haven't done that.

357
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,140
 So my question is, did he pee just a little bit?

358
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
 Or did he let it go?

359
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,640
 Did he empty his bladder?

360
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,580
 Because you know, any port in the storm, any star port in the storm, he's just peeing

361
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,580
 all over this UFO.

362
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,260
 Now again, I don't know if he was, I keep saying all over.

363
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,860
 I don't think he was walking around each corner and marking its territory.

364
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
 Going, "Weee!"

365
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,420
 Making it spin around.

366
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
 He might have just peed in a corner.

367
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,420
 It could have just been enough to make the pain go away.

368
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,180
 But whatever the, whatever he did, the you, you can guess what's coming next.

369
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,640
 The residents of the UFO did not like this.

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,500
 This is where the story actually gets super weird.

371
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:31,240
 He's peeing on the UFO and then a huge wind blows him back into the tent.

372
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,680
 He falls back into the tent and then he gets close to the microphone again.

373
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:47,220
 And as he's in the tent, he hears a massive explosion.

374
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,340
 He hears explosions all around him.

375
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,400
 Did he find the secret to destroying alien aircraft?

376
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
 Here's these explosions.

377
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,620
 He opens back up the tent.

378
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,260
 He's no longer in a metal room.

379
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,020
 His hand reaches out.

380
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
 What?

381
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,900
 I'll get to the chase.

382
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
 It's mud.

383
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
 It's mud.

384
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
 I'm not going to get into the sound effects.

385
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
 He touches his hand out and he touches mud.

386
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:16,080
 And when he crawls out of the tent, he's in a battlefield.

387
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,120
 Bombs are going off all around his tent.

388
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
 He's like, "Damn it.

389
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
 I knew I should have held it.

390
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,060
 I knew I should have held it a little bit longer."

391
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,600
 He's crawling through this battlefield and he sees a chain link fence in front of him,

392
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,720
 but it's all broken and there's a big rip in it.

393
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,700
 Conveniently a man-sized hole in it.

394
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:41,280
 He crawls through the hole and now he's standing on asphalt and that's when he sees-

395
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,040
 helicopters flying overhead towards the battle.

396
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,140
 Where in the world is this dude?

397
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,220
 And this is way a big overreaction for being in a UFO, right?

398
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
 That's all he did.

399
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,560
 If when your dog pee's in the corner of your house, you don't teleport him to an alternate

400
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,540
 reality of unending war, just hit him with a newspaper.

401
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,120
 But that's not what the aliens did.

402
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,220
 They sent him to this alternate reality.

403
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,540
 He sees these helicopters.

404
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,500
 He sees his explosions all in the distance.

405
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 Then he sees a door to the left.

406
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,440
 Basically, he turns to his right.

407
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,020
 He sees the utter unending hell of man-versed man.

408
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,540
 And he turns to the left.

409
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,940
 He sees an oak door.

410
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,020
 He's like, "Hmm, where should I go first?

411
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,660
 Maybe there's a toilet behind that door."

412
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,340
 So he turns left.

413
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
 He goes through the door.

414
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
 Eeeeeeeep!

415
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,420
 Apparently, apparently, he urcles behind the door.

416
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,320
 He walks inside and he's in a hotel room.

417
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,480
 Now, at this point, you're like, "Jason, damn it!

418
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,520
 Are you reading that some dude's dream?"

419
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 Well, no, I'm not.

420
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
 I'm just...

421
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,760
 This is not a dream.

422
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
 This is not a dream.

423
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,920
 Whatever it is, it could be totally made up.

424
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,560
 It could be 100% authentic.

425
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,360
 But at no point does he say, "And then I woke up."

426
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
 Okay?

427
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
 Just so we're clear.

428
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 He...

429
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,000
 He leaves behind the hellscape that is war.

430
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,780
 And just walks in a hotel room.

431
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,940
 And there is a table in the hotel room.

432
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,620
 I imagine it's all fancy plush stuff.

433
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,180
 I don't imagine it's like a Motel 6.

434
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,180
 There's like cockroaches everywhere.

435
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,460
 Sorry, Motel 6.

436
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,460
 I imagine it's a really plush hotel.

437
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,140
 But he walks in and there's like...

438
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,180
 I don't know why so long up on the interior designing.

439
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,860
 I was about to say there's lush curtains.

440
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
 I don't know.

441
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,860
 It's just a hotel.

442
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,240
 They just have an air conditioner built into the wall in two twin beds.

443
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
 But that's none of that's important.

444
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,560
 What's important is there is a table there that has a bunch of food on it.

445
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,120
 Listen, man, I get that Alice in Wonderland is not a documentary.

446
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,400
 I get that that's not like an actual survival guide for the paranormal.

447
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,560
 But I would not eat food that I found in an interdimensional door that on the outside

448
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,000
 is a hellscape of human suffering.

449
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,260
 Like, I was just...

450
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,860
 You just know better than that, right?

451
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
 You know better than that.

452
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,380
 If you go over to your friend's house and there's a bunch of cheese spreads on their

453
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,880
 table, you're going to eat it.

454
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,100
 You're going to eat every single piece of cheese.

455
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
 And that's fine.

456
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,900
 But if you're in an alternate dimension, even like you go back to the stories of the

457
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,180
 fairies, you don't eat their food, this dude just starts eating apples and stuff.

458
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,180
 I don't know.

459
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,380
 It may have been the Hoppastrami sandwiches.

460
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,060
 Those are a little bit harder to turn down.

461
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,360
 But he begins eating their food.

462
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
 Ooh.

463
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,960
 He starts to get a little sleepy.

464
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
 Damn it.

465
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
 Damn it, he does go to sleep.

466
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,440
 Okay, but it's still not a dream.

467
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
 I didn't...

468
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
 I forgot that part.

469
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
 I forgot that part.

470
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
 It's not a dream.

471
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
 I totally...

472
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 Okay, so he...

473
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,280
 But see, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

474
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
 I know what you guys are thinking.

475
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 It was all just a dream.

476
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 Hold on.

477
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 He...

478
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
 This was all...

479
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 This was all real.

480
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 He eats the food, he gets sleepy.

481
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,080
 Then he falls to sleep.

482
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,960
 But then he wakes up later.

483
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,800
 But it's still not...

484
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,080
 It's still not just a dream.

485
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,280
 It's still not just a dream.

486
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,120
 He wakes up later and he's like, "Ugh."

487
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,040
 He wakes up from not a dream and he has a weird thing in his head.

488
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,000
 Not like an implant, a thought.

489
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,040
 That's what humans call those things.

490
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
 He has a thought in his head.

491
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,560
 He goes, "Hmm, maybe.

492
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
 I don't know why.

493
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
 I just have a hunch.

494
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,640
 When I press my pinky against the wall, something will happen."

495
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,840
 He puts his finger against the wall and then a white, hot light envelops his body.

496
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,560
 It's kind of getting what he deserves at this point.

497
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,200
 He's getting disintegrated.

498
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,360
 What actually happens, though, is that the hot, white light envelops his whole body and

499
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,000
 the next thing he knows, he's laying stiff on the forest floor.

500
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,160
 But, oh, man, he looks up at the night sky.

501
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
 The owl is still perched on that same tree.

502
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
 "Whoo!

503
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
 Whoo!"

504
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,640
 He rubs his eyes and he's like, "What a dream!"

505
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,520
 He wasn't a dream, but he did hitchhike his way home.

506
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
 I know there's a lot of questions about this story.

507
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,600
 I have a few myself.

508
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,680
 First off, why didn't he hitchhike home?

509
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,640
 Like couldn't he just take his own car?

510
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,520
 Secondly, was his tent still there?

511
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,800
 Like Jason, those are your questions?

512
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 Those are your questions?

513
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 Well, yeah, I'm curious.

514
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
 Like why didn't he just take his own car home?

515
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 Where's his tent?

516
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,520
 That story was told, I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

517
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,760
 They got it from a man named Chuck Minetta.

518
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,400
 So it may, Chuck Minetta may be the guy who this story happened to.

519
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
 And I would love to track it down.

520
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,200
 I actually was able to track down Chuck Minetta's website.

521
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,760
 He has a website.

522
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,280
 Now, I can't guarantee that it will work on your mobile devices because it uses the most

523
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,760
 basic HTML I've seen in decades.

524
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,840
 It has frames.

525
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
 You remember frames?

526
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,120
 This is basically two web pages in one.

527
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,880
 I don't even know if it'll work on most browsers.

528
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,240
 Because when I went to it, because I wanted to know more about this guy, this is what

529
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
 I've been able to gather.

530
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,120
 He's a retired firefighter.

531
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,920
 He uses Twitter for one thing only, to win firearms.

532
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,040
 Apparently, he keeps retweeting this stuff saying I enter to win this six hour fully

533
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
 automatic weapon.

534
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,680
 I just saw this stuff.

535
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,640
 Every tweet is like, I use this to get this cult 45.

536
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 I use this to...

537
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
 Oh, hey, Cobra Commander.

538
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
 How many weapons do you need?

539
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
 How many contests are you entering?

540
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 Why do you need all this stuff?

541
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,160
 No, I'm sure he's a great guy.

542
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
 But he has...

543
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,880
 I hope so, because he has all these weapons.

544
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,360
 But Chuck Minetta has this website where it's basically two things.

545
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:37,840
 It's a list of paranormal experiences he's been through and his favorite car chases.

546
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,320
 His favorite car chases and flash mobs.

547
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,280
 So it's basically two sides of this website.

548
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 One is actually pertains to what we talk about on this show that I spent maybe five minutes

549
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,480
 on because it was a solid wall of text and it hurt my eyeballs.

550
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,680
 The other one was car chase scenes and flash mobs on YouTube.

551
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,440
 And I wish I spent way too much time.

552
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,240
 And that side of the website doesn't even work.

553
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,080
 You click on the flash mob and then nothing pops up.

554
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,760
 So then I was like, dang it, I love flash mobs.

555
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,480
 So then I had to go back to the main page and look at the title of the video and type

556
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 it in YouTube.

557
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,440
 Flash mob attacks hotel.

558
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
 Man with many guns saves the day.

559
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,680
 I was like, hmm, maybe this does have to do with the show.

560
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,520
 And then he has scenes from Bullet and Ronin and all these car chase movies.

561
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
 Nothing from Fast and the Furious.

562
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,800
 That was bizarre.

563
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,080
 Nothing from Transformers 3.

564
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,960
 I had great car chase scenes in that.

565
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,360
 But let's go back to the paranormal thing.

566
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,480
 So he has the enthusiasm in my voice.

567
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,120
 I don't want to say goodbye to my flash mobs.

568
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
 He has this whole list of paranormal stuff that he went through.

569
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
 And it might be a five.

570
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,920
 I was just skimming it.

571
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,320
 Because it was just one of those web pages where there's no break and there's just a

572
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,480
 mountain of text I'm reading it through and he's like, one day I heard something and then

573
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,880
 he has the sound effects.

574
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,640
 Jason, he's basically just you.

575
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,160
 But using HTML.

576
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,720
 And I just like, yeah, it just gets to the point.

577
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 You saw a ghost.

578
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
 Your wife saw a ghost.

579
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,800
 You woke up one day.

580
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
 The ghost stopped being there.

581
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
 I think his kids were complaining.

582
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,520
 There was green monsters in his closet.

583
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,880
 And then it went thump, thump, thump, thump.

584
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,520
 And then it never showed up again.

585
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,160
 That was literally like 4,000 words to tell that story.

586
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,360
 And then he also, this was disappointing.

587
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,920
 So I'm going to share it with you.

588
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,160
 I'm skimming this stuff at this point because there's so much stuff to go by.

589
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,200
 He says that once he found a Bigfoot egg, and I was like, oh, now we're cooking with

590
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 grease.

591
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,080
 He says that he found a Bigfoot egg.

592
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
 He found this big furry ball.

593
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,480
 And at this point I'm like, dude, you're making this up.

594
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,080
 But at least this is something, right?

595
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,240
 This is something.

596
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
 He found this Bigfoot egg.

597
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,840
 He is like six to eight inches in diameters, this big furry egg.

598
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,320
 And he took it home and then he set it on the counter and then he's watching the news

599
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,400
 and it's like, citizens of the world, beware.

600
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
 And I was like, wait, what?

601
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,600
 You're making up a story.

602
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,920
 You might not want to make up the part where everyone on the planet is warned about it.

603
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
 I was like, what?

604
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,200
 But I was like, okay, on game at this point my eyes hurt from reading all this other stuff.

605
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,760
 The news reports like, watch out.

606
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,840
 If you find a little fur ball, it's not just a puppy because he thought it was a puppy.

607
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,440
 He thought it was a perfectly spherical puppy.

608
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,680
 So I'm reading this and the guys like, the reporters like, be careful if you find this

609
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,200
 puppy because it's not a puppy.

610
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,320
 It's actually a space ape.

611
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 It's a space ape baby.

612
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,080
 I'm like, what?

613
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,440
 And then he goes and he gets in his airplane in his backyard apparently as a runway.

614
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,560
 And at this point I shouldn't realize what I was reading.

615
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,880
 It's not creepypasta.

616
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
 It's actually worse.

617
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,000
 He says that he had a plane in his backyard.

618
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
 He goes, he gets in his plane.

619
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,440
 He starts flying away.

620
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,480
 He left the bigfoot egg.

621
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,000
 But as he's flying away, he looks in his rear view mirror and he looks and bigfoot's in

622
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,240
 the back seat of the airplane.

623
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,240
 I'm reading that and then it's, and then it says, and then I, and then I woke up.

624
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,720
 I'm like, damn it dude.

625
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,120
 And so I scrolled up and that's under his section that said, recollections and dreams,

626
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,960
 which I was skimming so quickly.

627
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,400
 I spent five minutes reading about this dude's dream.

628
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
 I was like, come on bro.

629
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 I'm busy dude.

630
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 Do you know how busy I am?

631
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
 I have time to read about baby bigfoot.

632
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,720
 I would love to read about baby bigfoot eggs, but not if you're dreaming about them.

633
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,160
 So I had to share that disappointment with you.

634
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,080
 I don't think this, I don't think this story was a dream though.

635
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,400
 But when I looked through his mountain of text, I couldn't find this story.

636
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,080
 So I don't even know if this is Chuck's story.

637
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,880
 We're back to peeing on the UFO.

638
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 Because Chuck's story, that, if anyone ever asked you, hey man, have you ever had any

639
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,080
 paranormal encounters, you wouldn't be like, well I had a dream once.

640
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,600
 You might like, after a couple of conversations.

641
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,200
 But if anyone ever asked you, have you ever seen, have you ever experienced anything weird?

642
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,160
 You wouldn't say, yeah, once I meet my wife, heard something walking down the stairs, but

643
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,320
 then we didn't see anything.

644
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
 You would go, I peed on a UFO.

645
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,680
 That'd be the very first thing you'd talk about on this wall of text and I couldn't

646
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,020
 find it.

647
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,800
 So again, my eyeballs could have completely gotten fried at some point.

648
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,360
 I could have spent too much time watching the flash on videos.

649
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,000
 I don't know if Chuck actually experienced this.

650
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,440
 I think he heard this story from someone else and he reported it for his website, which

651
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,000
 is apparently called Computer Network, or that was a magazine he used to work for.

652
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,080
 The whole thing's super confusing, but putting behind, it wasn't a dream, the other part

653
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
 was.

654
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,320
 But whether or not the pedigree of the story is real, like we always can go back to that,

655
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,900
 is it real, was it completely made up?

656
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
 It wasn't a dream.

657
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,700
 I stand by the fact that as far as we know it wasn't a dream, but whenever we have these

658
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,100
 solo witness stories, it could totally be fake.

659
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,220
 It could be, but we also cover so much weird stuff on this show that is a single witness

660
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,900
 and then we're able to find little pieces of evidence that actually back it up that

661
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,300
 I don't think it's fair to automatically dismiss stories like this out of hand.

662
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,620
 Definitely suspicious.

663
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,140
 There's more witnesses, it makes it more, I don't want to say more true, but more verifiable.

664
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,520
 And I think the story's really interesting, not necessarily because the guy peed on the

665
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,680
 UFO, he was thrown around to alternate dimensions, all that stuff, which all that stuff is fascinating

666
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,180
 in and of itself.

667
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,240
 But I think it's interesting, I want to wrap it up like this.

668
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,440
 This story is completely out there, and it's never gotten a lot of attention, and it may

669
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,880
 have not gotten a lot of attention because it's fake, or it may just gotten not a lot

670
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,840
 of attention because it's obscure.

671
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:52,740
 This is one of those stories that is so bizarre that it actually disrupts the lore of UFO

672
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
ology.

673
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,220
 Imagine if that was the very first UFO story you had ever heard.

674
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,380
 You never watched anything about the X-Files, you never heard anything about Betty and Barney

675
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,860
 Hill, you never heard anything about Grey Aliens, Whitney Stryver, UFO abductions,

676
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,700
 Roswell, cattle mutilations, none of that.

677
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,900
 Imagine if the very first UFO story you heard was this story.

678
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,840
 But a man who's out camping and then he appears on the ship and these bizarre events, these

679
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,880
 trans-dimensional events take place.

680
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
 It would totally change the way you look at UFOs, one you want to look at them really

681
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,240
 as a physical thing, you want to think of aliens as having some sort of government or

682
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,960
 some sort of structure, you want to have this idea of really there's not really even a

683
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,280
 mention of a UFO or a craft in the story.

684
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,300
 I think it's interesting because so much of what we know about aliens builds on top of

685
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,460
 each other, which a lot of times adds credence to it.

686
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,900
 If you have one person who goes, "Hey, I'm from Sweden," and he tells you stuff about

687
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,020
 Sweden and you've never met anyone from Sweden before, you may go, "That guy's totally nuts.

688
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,940
 Donald Duck during Christmas time, you have Taco Tuesdays, what the hell's going on over

689
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,940
 in Sweden?"

690
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,540
 But as you get to know more people from Sweden, everything starts to make sense.

691
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,720
 It doesn't necessarily make sense, but you realize that there's other people from Sweden

692
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,680
 and they also believe in doing the same things.

693
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,880
 But if you'd only ever met that one person from Sweden and they told you all this weird

694
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,280
 stuff, you'd have a real hard time processing it.

695
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,120
 And stories like this are so outside of the norm, it's like a guy coming from Sweden,

696
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,520
 but he has paranoid delusions.

697
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,440
 And he's telling you stuff about Sweden, he's telling you he's Donald Duck.

698
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
 Like, "What?

699
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
 No, you're not."

700
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,880
 And it would totally - you would be afraid to meet other people from Sweden.

701
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,920
 The only person you ever met from Sweden was insane.

702
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,800
 And I'm not saying Chuck's insane, but this story is insane.

703
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,740
 Such a bizarre story.

704
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,080
 We as fans of this dead rabbit radio listeners.

705
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,520
 We are Tentos deep.

706
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,220
 We're way beyond the normal stuff on the show.

707
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,520
 We don't talk about Whitney Streiber, except in passing, we don't talk about Betty and

708
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,160
 Barney Hill, except in passing.

709
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,340
 That's all surface level UFO OG.

710
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,840
 In this show, we as a group have descended way past that.

711
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,280
 So for us to talk about this story, it's interesting, but we have the background for it.

712
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,680
 For a beginner UFO oligosis, the story would blow their brains out.

713
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
 They would have such a hard time.

714
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
 We can ask.

715
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,000
 I'm sure you guys were also asking too, why did they have to hitchhike home?

716
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,440
 We're so used to weird stuff on this show.

717
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,280
 This story is bizarre even by our standards, but it's not so bizarre.

718
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,760
 I always think that's an interesting thing.

719
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,900
 This show focuses on the most obscure stories.

720
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,420
 And the stories are only going to get even more bizarre going forward.

721
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,180
 And it doesn't make them any less true.

722
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,380
 I think that this story could easily be as true as any other UFO encounter where it's

723
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,700
 very by the book guy driving through the middle of nowhere.

724
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,700
 UFO abducts them.

725
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,180
 They show them some star maps.

726
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,460
 They talk to them about the environment and then they drop them back off in 4 hours of

727
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
 past.

728
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,380
 Those stories are a dime a dozen.

729
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,720
 I wouldn't even do the podcast if that's all I talked about.

730
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,960
 You wouldn't listen to it because it'd be super boring.

731
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,040
 But I think it's fascinating because we can just stumble across these absolutely off the

732
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:20,400
 wall stories and it makes me think how many more are out there that are just insane versions

733
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,280
 of alien abductions or phenomenon.

734
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,480
 It is a spooky world out there guys.

735
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,180
 A whole lot of madness going on.

736
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,980
 We are only starting on this journey.

737
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:42,180
 So my advice to you is to go on Twitter and start winning guns because if we want to survive

738
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,980
 the madness we're going to have to be armed.

739
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,420
 And we're going to have to be armed for free.

740
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,780
 All your guns, they have to have been won in a contest.

741
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,980
 That is the way the universe demands it.

742
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,520
