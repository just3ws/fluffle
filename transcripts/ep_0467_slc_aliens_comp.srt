1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Did American Frontiersman Davy Crockett have a face-to-face encounter with the paranormal?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we travel to Salt Lake City to take a look at an astounding revelation.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Are Mormons and Masons living underneath the city, serving their reptilian overlords today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to a longtime supporter of the show, longtime patron of the show, Grant Scott.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 He's been supporting the show since really the beginning.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 He was the one who designed the artwork you see. I call it "As Above".

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's a lot of symbolism in it and it's what we have on our merchandise.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 He designed that for us and that's awesome.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So in return for that, we're going to give him the keys of the Carpenter Cup for this episode.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 A longtime supporter of the show. Really, really appreciated.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 So Grant, let's hop in that, Jason Zalapi. We're headed out to Texas.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And guys, put on your bulletproof vest.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We'll strap up. We're putting on ballistic helmets.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Because we are going back to 1836, Republic of Texas.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Bullets are all flying. Oh, look out, look out.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Grant, no, not you. You have to keep your head up.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 He's like, "Oh, I hate this episode." He's totally getting shot at.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We're like, "Hehehe." And we're all totally safe.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 He's like, "Oh, my nose." We're driving through the Battle of the Alamo.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Now, I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of facts about the Battle of the Alamo,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 because I didn't look them up.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 But from what I remember is you had this fort in Texas.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And Santa Ana was this general in Mexico who was like,

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 "I want to take over Texas." Or reclaimed Texas,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 or it was theirs to begin with and they wanted to make.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 So Santa Ana is bringing his troops and they surround the Alamo

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and they're like, "Get out! Go away, go away!"

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And the people in the Alamo are like, "Uh-uh-uh."

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And for 10 days there was this siege and eventually Santa Ana's like,

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 "Pfft, no, I got something to do on the 11th day. Let's end this."

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 There was a 90-minute battle and in that 90 minutes,

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 all of the defenders of the Alamo were killed.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 There's like 140 of them. They're all killed.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Davy Crockett being one of them.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So there's your brief and probably highly inaccurate history of Texas.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But that's not what we're talking about. And you're like, "Thank God!"

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So we can take off our ballistic armor right now.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Grant, you okay? You okay? Yeah, he's okay. He's just sleeping it off.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 He's just slumped against the steering wheel. He's cool, bro.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So anyways, we'll call in the Carbenter Coptor to lifelight him out of here,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 get him some fresh blood. We are going to walk around.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 He's like, "No, I want to be here for this story!"

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Waving goodbye to him. We're going to go back in time a bit.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So when Davy Crockett was head-- This is about Davy Crockett.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 If I haven't introduced that yet, I did actually in the beginning.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So before Davy Crockett got to the Alamo, he was a politician.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 He was like a front-tier, so many was a legend.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Legend says he held a bear when he was three years old.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So maybe a bear fetus.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Maybe like a bear was just born out of a mama bear.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 The mama bear was like, "Oh, why did I just lose 10 pounds?"

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 "Uh, I just kept on walking."

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Nutra system really works!"

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And then he came along as a three-year-old and like,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 stringled a baby with a umbilical cord.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 That's brutal! And this is a brutal image!

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But that's the only way a three-year-old could kill a bear, right?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Anyways, before he got to the Alamo, he was headed out there.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 He'd given up his job as a politician. He thought the voters were stupid.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So he's leaving the East Coast and he's headed to Texas.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he's hanging out with his bro, and he's eating food.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 [mimics eating]

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And then he's leaning against a tree and he taps his axe against the tree.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And then all of a sudden...

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 [mimics eating]

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 A glow.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 A shape.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 [mimics eating]

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 He sees something that he describes as a big, ugly, covered in hair,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 large rows of broken teeth, and the height, quote, of three foundlings.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Unquote. Which is an orphan.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Which I didn't know that's how they... I didn't know that's how they gauge distances.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 What? You want me to go all the way to Minneapolis?

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 That's like 5,000 orphans!

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 So maybe it's different for height versus length.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Maybe you can imagine three orphans standing on each other's heads.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But anyways, he says this thing was super ugly and it says to him,

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 "You're gonna die, bro. Like, this is not going to end well."

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 If you do not leave, if you go to that fort you're headed to, it's the Alamo, right?

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Right? That's the Alamo, right? And David Crockett's like...

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Kind of looking side to side, he's like, "It's A Alamo! I don't know if it's THE Alamo!"

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And Bigfoot's like, "You're going to THE Alamo! Don't go there. You're gonna die, dude."

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And as David Crockett starts to question this thing, like, wait,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 well, first off, what are you? Second, where'd you come from?

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Third, what do you mean I'm going to die?

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 He starts to shimmer away. The Bigfoot, not David Crockett.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 That would be a totally different story. Bigfoot...

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 [mimics eating]

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Disappears. He's writing this letter to this friend of his named Abe, and he goes,

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 "I saw this thing and it warned me not to go."

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And he blamed it on undigested food. He goes, "Oh, I must have eaten some beef."

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 That didn't really agree with me. Must have had hallucination.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 If that was the case, everyone who went to Taco Bell ever would see paranormal activity all the time.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Every episode of Go Centers would start with them ordering chalupas.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And they're like, "Oh, oh, look out, look out! The Dibbock Box! It's alive!"

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 What's interesting about this is there's always been that assumption.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 We've made it a lot of times on this show that if Bigfoot's real, it's probably not a biological entity.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It probably is some sort of spirit.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But here we have not only Bigfoot materializing and dematerializing in front of someone.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It knows the future, which throws a whole other monkey wrench--

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Sorry, throws a whole other Bigfoot wrench into the whole thing, right?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now Bigfoot is-- Now Bigfoot is an oracle as well.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Now, I tried really hard to find out whether or not this story was true or not.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Because I keep seeing this letter talk, but there's no photographs of the letter.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Apparently there are people who say that the letter exists, but that he was joking and then other people go,

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 "No, no, no, he's using-- he's swearing it. He's like saying, 'By as a Christian, I swear I saw this thing.'"

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So he's taking it seriously.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But the most likely thing is that the letter never existed.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 This is an internet rumor floating around.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's the most likely scenario, because I couldn't find a copy of the letter.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I mean, it's not like I was digging through three mains of the Alamo, but it's not--

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 There's no screenshots or anything like that, so the chances that it's all made up.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 What would be interesting about it is if it was made up, it would be made up with Bigfoot lore, right?

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 The common perception of Bigfoot is it is a creature that walks around,

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 has a-- it eats, and it breeds, and it lives, and it dies.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The idea of it being a mystical creature is very, very rare.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It's not the common form Bigfoot, so if this was 100% made up, why wouldn't the person make--

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 The person making it up would use typical Bigfoot lore.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Just like if you're making up a UFO story, it's more likely you're going to involve grey aliens or reptilians or something like that.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Then you're going to the conformers, or one of the really, really obscure alien groups out there.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 So that kind of lends a little bit of credibility to this story,

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 that David Crockett actually was warned of his impending doom by a magical Bigfoot.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 But whatever the case, I find this an interesting piece of Bigfoot lore, if it's real,

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 because it means that all those people across time, all those years that have saw Bigfoot,

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and they, like, tried shooting it, or they ran away, or they tried, like, I don't know, catching it,

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 maybe they just needed to sit and listen.

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Maybe Bigfoot would have told each of them, warned them, of an impending tragedy.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Okay, Grant, go ahead and bring down that Carbentercopter. He's all in traction.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 He's-- But he's good. He's good. He's giving us a thumbs up.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He can still fly the Carbentercopter. Come down and pick us up.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And first off, actually, before we go anywhere, I want to give a shout out to three listeners in particular.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I'm giving a shout out to Ruinor2077. I'm giving a shout out to Yuri--

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Pog-- Pogudin, and I'm giving a shout out to Kelton Sutton.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 All three of these guys shot me emails.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Six weeks ago, I issued a "6 Weeks to a Better You" challenge, and each of them said that this challenge helped them.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Ruinor2077 lost weight. Yuri started working on a hobby he'd spent a long time thinking about,

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 and he sent me some of the results of that, and it looked really cool.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It was really, really awesome. He said he wouldn't have done it if he didn't have that challenge.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Kelton Sutton gave up smoking, is living a healthier lifestyle, found out he's going to be a dad.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So all of these things were awesome. As far as my "6 Weeks to a Better You," still working on it, still working on it.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I did have some struggles. I feel like I'm in a better place. Physically, I still am not where I want to be weight-wise.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You can't give up, right? You keep going forward. So I want to give a shout out to Ruinor2077, Yuri Pogudin, and Kelton Sutton,

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 because that's awesome. I really enjoyed getting those emails, and I'm glad that that challenge worked for you.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Wallace Waddle said in his book, "The Science of Getting Rich,"

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 "For every decision, there is an effective answer and an ineffective answer."

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 That's how you know. If you only do the effective answers, you will be successful. It's the science of getting rich. It's the science of success.

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It's a book all about visualization. I thought about it. It's in the public domain. I thought about doing an audiobook recording of it,

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 because it's such a great book. But is this helping my end goal? And Yuri and Kelton and Ruinor, they made decisions that helped their end goal.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So we just all keep going forward, but I wanted to give a shout out to those three listeners in particular. That was inspiring to me.

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 That was inspiring to me, so I really, really appreciate it. Grant, here we'll wipe that tear away from Grant's eye. He can't do it. He's in that full-body cast.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Take us up, up and away. We are headed to Salt Lake City, Utah.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 We're flying over the flattest piece of American landscape, the state of Utah. Just salt everywhere. Everyone's super salty. They're mean all the time.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We're flying through. We're going to take a look at an article, a blog. I don't even know how you classify this. The Rantines called Reptilian Encounters in Utah.

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 This is from a blog. It's on Blogspot called MyCloseEncounters.Blogspot.com. It's by B. Allen Walton.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Now, I'm going to be naming a bunch of people in this. This B. Allen, if you're going to be anyone, B. Allen.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 B. Allen is saying these people are saying these things. Don't sue me, Kay. He's saying you're saying this. I'm simply repeating it.

160
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 If we're flying over, we're going to land in the middle. The whole state is one giant landing pad. We're just like, "Land there."

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 We land, we get out. Grant is out of his cast now just so he can walk and we don't have to push a wheelchair.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 We meet B. Allen Walton. The big B is what he's called Big B. We go to his house. He has this huge house.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 He has this giant map. It's a map of Salt Lake City. The map is as flat as the state itself. He turns around and goes, "Welcome, my friends.

164
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I'm here to tell you about something that I've uncovered." Here's his thesis. Let's just jump to the thesis here because you don't have to be prepared going forward.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 He believes that underneath Salt Lake City, there's a massive system of tunnels. That's pretty par for the course. We hear underground earth, stuff like that.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Tunnel, secret tunnels, secret civilizations. That's pretty par for the course.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But underneath Salt Lake City, it's inhabited by a bunch of masons. A typical boogie man of conspiracy theorists.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Mormons? It's interesting. I guess it makes sense because it's Salt Lake City geographically. It makes sense. What do they add to the conspiracy?

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I wonder if the conspiracy theory would be that there are Mormons living underground if the story happened in Budapest.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I think the only reason why the Mormons are the boogie man is because he's growing up in an environment with a bunch of Mormons.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 In any words, you have Mormons, you have masons, and you have reptilians down there. Now the party's getting started.

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 That's his whole thesis. We start off his blog with this. This should really prepare you for where we're headed. I imagine this is going to be a long episode.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 This should prepare you for where we're headed.

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 "Although I have no conscious memory, I do have what might be called intuitive memories in the form of dreams and so on, of being involved in some sort of government-alien interaction scenario since a child."

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So other than the fact that he just admitted to us that most of what he's experienced personally has been when the subconscious mind is in control, a.k.a. dreaming,

176
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 he starts off by saying "Although I have no conscious memory." The rest of this blog is stuff he remembers. The rest of the blog is literally him having to remember stories that other people told him.

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 So don't say "Hey guys, trust everything I'm about to say." Also, I can't remember stuff. I can only remember stuff when I dream it.

178
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So he believes the Mormons and the masons have made an alliance with the reptilians and they formed the hybrid race known as the Melchizedex,

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 which is an old Judea term for high priest. Here's a tip when you're creating world building. This goes for people who believe that this stuff is real and you at home writing a fantasy novel.

180
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Keep it simple. Keep it totally simple. When you're reading a book, if you had to keep reading the term Melchizedex over and over and over again, your brain, just call them the mels or something.

181
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You're making it up. You're making it up now. Again, he's saying this is real, but at that point if I was like eavesdropping on the evil reptilian overlord, I'm like hidden at the perfect hiding spot and I hear him go "Then soon the Melchizedex will come."

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I'd be like "Sir, hey listen, I know we're mortal enemies and you're probably gonna eat me after this, but you might want to change the name."

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Just for marketing purposes, just call them the hybrids or the high ones. So let's look into a little bit more of this.

184
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So B. Allen has a friend, apparently, allegedly, again, do not sue me, Kay, because I'm getting this from his website.

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He has a friend named Kay, she sues me. She's like "That's libel. He's not my friend."

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Quote unquote friend named Kay Studstrup. Now Kay is a hybrid. Kay says she's a hybrid. How do we know she's a hybrid?

187
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Because she has scales on her legs. He says when you, B. Allen says he looked at her lower legs and saw, he goes "Not flaky skin!"

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Because I know you're thinking exactly what I'm thinking. She has psoriasis, right? No, no, no, no, no. She had pink scales on her skin. It was not flaky.

189
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Was it Dandruff? Oh no! Oh no, I'm a hybrid. I can't wear black shirts. There's flakes everywhere. I mean, scales everywhere.

190
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Anyway, she's a hybrid, but apparently only from the knee down. The program didn't really work. She's like "I could run really fast, but I have human feet and human thighs.

191
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It's my calves that are super alien." She has alien calves. And this should give you an idea of what's going on.

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 She believes that she was abducted by aliens, according to B. Allen. Because when she was a teenager, she had a photographic memory.

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But as she's gotten older, she remembers less. Now, that leads to an interesting question. Now we have two people who have memory.

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 First off, let's look at the fact we have two people who have memory problems who are now going to be telling us stories about alien encounters.

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But what if? Because you've always heard about that. Like people getting abducted and then they don't remember it. The aliens are messing with their mind.

196
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 What if? This belongs to all conspiracy theory, Iceberg. Alzheimer's is caused by alien abductions. That's why it doesn't affect everybody.

197
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 People who have severe Alzheimer's, it's because they are abducted by aliens. I don't believe that. I'm going to go on the record. I don't believe that.

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I don't believe that. I'm just stating that in the public. But these people might, because apparently they've made a connection between poor memory and alien encounters.

199
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Anyways, so Kay Sudstrup has a problem with her memory. As she's gotten older, she has a hard time remembering things. That is paranormal. Call the Ghostbusters.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So as she gets older, she has a hard time remembering stuff. B. Allen always has a hard time remembering stuff.

201
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Kay Sudstrup also has had, other than being abducted and having her memory messed with, she actually has seen aliens wide awake, walking down the street, more specifically, not walking down the street, walking through Nordstroms.

202
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 You remember Nordstroms? Are they still even around? They used to date this girl at Nordstroms. That's how old I am. I don't even know if this store is still around.

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I remember dating a girl at Nordstrom. She was at Nordstrom and she saw aliens in the-- and this was in Nordstrom in Salt Lake City. She's walking through the mall and she sees aliens.

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And you're like, "Whoa, dude! She saw reptilians at the mall!" No. No. "Cold your horses, guys." She sees tall, lanky blondes with bowl haircuts.

205
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Like the bowl-- like the monkeys. Not the animal. The band. And-- and-- that's not enough, right, though?

206
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You would be foolish to think that two people who look like Taylor Swift with matching haircuts would be aliens. Although I'm pretty sure that Taylor Swift is an alien herself.

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But that's not all. That's not all. We have this quote. Quote, "What tipped her off was a conversation she overheard between the two of them. Also, neither of them had any blemishes whatsoever."

208
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Unquote. Two things there, right? First off, that's all the proof you need, right? No blemishes? I'm sold! I totally believe the Mormon, Mason, Reptilian conspiracy you're weaving. No blemishes! That's impossible!

209
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But what was the conversation they were having? What possible conversation could two lanky blondes have that make you think they were space aliens? We don't know.

210
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Maybe she doesn't remember, actually, now that I think about it. We have a lot of memory problems in this group, but that's not-- you go, "Jason, you're nitpicking, right? You got two people with fudgy memories."

211
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 No, no, no, no, no. I haven't even gotten to the meat of the matter. The sweet, sweet Reptilian meat of the matter.

212
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So what does all of this have to do with? How does B Allen and K figure into any of this stuff? Well, let's take a look at what the boots on the ground are telling us.

213
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Because we have some investigators. This is all being focused at a place called Crossroads Plaza. I don't know if it's still there, but back in the 2010s, this was a mall, and there's a Crossroads Cinema there.

214
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And underneath the plaza, apparently it's like three stories where it goes down a floor, like a store on top, a floor in the middle, floor underground.

215
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Supposedly on the lowest level, there are access tunnels to underneath the city. That's where the Reptilians live. They're not just hanging out at the food court.

216
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 As awesome as that would be. They're not only underneath the mall, they're underneath the underneath of the mall.

217
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So there's a paranormal investigator, a researcher named John Todd. Again, don't sue me, John. B Allen is saying you're doing this nonsense, not me.

218
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 John Todd goes to the Crossroads Plaza and he's like eating some churros.

219
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And then he's like getting his picture taken out of the glamorous shots. Ka-ching! He's getting his ears pierced at Claire's.

220
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And when he's finally done having a fun day, he goes and he goes to the bottom floor of the mall.

221
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 He goes to where there's like a construction zone where they're still building stuff underneath the mall and he's walking.

222
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And he goes, "This is where I hear... I've heard whispers of things. I've heard this is where the Reptilians are."

223
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Because there had been apparently stories going around that reptiles were kidnapping construction workers.

224
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Some of these stories seem to come from... Kay has a friend, Kay Stutzer of As a Friend named Iravine Davis.

225
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And Iravine Davis has two sons, Robert and Peter.

226
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And Peter works as a security guard at the mall and has been telling people that there's reptiles living in the mall.

227
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 So that's what seems to have sparked this whole thing, was B Allen heard fourth or fifth hand.

228
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Not even... Peter didn't even ever saw a reptile man.

229
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Other security guard told Peter, "Yeah, there's reptiles living underneath the mall."

230
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And then he told his mom and the mom told Kay. And then Kay tells B Allen, "Who's exposing this to the world? Who's blowing this up?"

231
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Memory problems all the way up, by the way.

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But anyway, so John Todd is there. He wants to know whether or not these stories are true.

233
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 He sneaks into the construction site underneath the mall and he's looking around.

234
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He sees a dark tunnel. And then he sees something move.

235
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 What did he see move?

236
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 If you said he saw a reptilian, you're wrong. That's not what he saw.

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 What he saw was a construction worker who showed up and began yelling at him, "Go away, dude! This isn't... What are you doing here? You're not a construction worker. Where's all your safety equipment?"

238
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Now, this is supposedly proof of the cover-up.

239
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Not the fact that you're not supposed to be in a construction zone. Not the fact that OSHA laws exist and if you just have random people walking around your work site, you can get in big trouble.

240
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 No, this is proof that right around the corner, there is a reptile currently reading the Book of Mormon.

241
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Just out of sight, just out of sight.

242
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So anyways, if you ever want to put this theory to the test, just walk in a construction zone, middle of the day.

243
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 If anyone runs you out, you know you're too close to the truth. You're probably too close to falling into a vat of what he meant.

244
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Now, John Todd does say that he did give the construction worker to admit that a construction worker had recently gone missing.

245
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 He'd been gone for five days.

246
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Now, that a lunatic would think, "Aha, reptilians! A normal person would think meth-binged."

247
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Like, generally if someone on a construction site hasn't been seen for five days, they're probably at their girlfriend's house.

248
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 They're probably still awake. And you probably don't want them to come into work and start moving heavy machinery.

249
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But that's not all, because John says, "Oh, no, no, no, don't discounted the fact that I talked to some random guy and he just happened to say a co-worker had been missing for five days.

250
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I'm not going to name who the guy was or who had gone missing or whether or not there was any police reports."

251
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

252
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 John Todd said he also used to work at the Dugway Military Base, which is also in Utah.

253
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And he said he met a man at a tire shop who, quote, "swore that he had seen people transform into reptilian humanoids in the town of Dugway."

254
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Unquote.

255
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 So it's a worldwide conspiracy, guys, but Barry at Jiffy Lube knows the truth.

256
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 This random construction worker underground is like, "Yeah, I guess I should probably be keeping my mouth shut because these reptilians control the world, but you're some random guy,

257
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 so I'm going to tell you there's some horrible conspiracy going on."

258
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And then when you go to get your tire changed, you're hanging out and you're like, "Hey, anything new happened? How are things going out here?"

259
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "Oh, you know, they're the worldwide reptilian conspiracies at the town of Dugway. I've seen it myself."

260
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I'm starting to think that these people involved in the story, everyone's laughing at them.

261
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Like, people in town know that they'll fall for anything reptile related.

262
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 They're walking around with little pennants that say reptiles.

263
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Because, I mean, guys, you can either have it one or two ways. It's a super secret cult that's slowly taken over the planet, or everyone in the world knows about them.

264
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You can't really have it both ways.

265
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 We do have Kate says about this guy she knows named Dan.

266
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 He got abducted by aliens. He doesn't remember it.

267
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Again, that seems to be a common thing.

268
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I'm including this because of this phrase. This might sound kind of dark, but I just thought this was an interesting way of putting it.

269
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Here's this quote. There's this quote.

270
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So he got abducted by aliens. He has a hard time remembering stuff now.

271
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And then, quote, "Dan became very suicidal afterwards."

272
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 As opposed to just kind of occasionally suicidal.

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 How you feeling today?

274
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Yeah, I'm suicidal, but I'm not that suicidal.

275
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I'm not very suicidal. I'm not like Dan over there.

276
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But, you know, I'm just kind of like, eh, maybe suicide, maybe not.

277
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 What is very suicidal?

278
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Somewhat suicidal, neutral as far as suicide goes.

279
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Anyways, he goes to, I've got to blow through the rest of these.

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So it's going to be so long otherwise.

281
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 B. Allen starts talking about all of these other figures that have come forward in the world of UFOology to expose reptilian things.

282
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Bob Lazar, John Lear, you know, those are pretty big names.

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 William Cooper, another big name.

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Bill Hamilton, Agent Yellowfruit, George Knapp, Billy Good, Agent Yell-Who?

285
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I had to look this up. Who is Agent Yellowfruit?

286
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I know those names. I know John Lear, William Cooper, Bill Hamilton.

287
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Who's Agent Yellow?

288
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 First off, why are you Agent Yellow?

289
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Banana! That's what you are, right?

290
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You're a banana. You're Agent Banana.

291
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Agent- That's the only yellow fruit, or a pear, maybe?

292
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 You're Agent Yellowfruit.

293
00:25:35,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

294
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Who's just on Joe Rogan, not too long ago.

295
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Agent Yellowfruit, never heard of a guy.

296
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 He goes on to say that eventually, again, I'm just trying to bust through this stuff.

297
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Robert and Peter Davis, the Davis boys, the world's famous Davis boys.

298
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 They have that series of book about them.

299
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Make it their way through an underground catacomb.

300
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 They find a door that they believe leads to the alien complex.

301
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It was separate from the other doors.

302
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Most doors are normally just one door for the whole building.

303
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 You just go through a portal, you appear somewhere.

304
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 This door was separate from the other doors.

305
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 There was a bunch of other doors, but this door was not connected.

306
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 What does that even mean?

307
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Anyways, they walk towards it.

308
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 They see a green glow underneath the door.

309
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 They get scared. They run away.

310
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Those are intrepid reptile hunters.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Don't you feel like you're in good hands?

312
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Don't you feel like this is totally taken care of?

313
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 These two guys are investigating reptilians underneath Salt Lake City,

314
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 but they can't open a door.

315
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They see a green glow. They can't open the door.

316
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He also tells a story about a guy that he talked to who was on a bus one day,

317
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and the guy sitting next to his friend on the bus says that he knows

318
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 of a construction worker who was attacked by a lizard man.

319
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I'm going to give you a tip, dude.

320
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Just say sources I've heard.

321
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Don't tell me all that stuff, because that makes it --

322
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 you have memory problems.

323
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 You have memory problems, and you're admitting that you're playing a game of telephone.

324
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Your buddy was on a bus talking to somebody, a totally random person,

325
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 who happened to know of a construction worker who was attacked by a lizard man.

326
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Just say sources.

327
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Say it makes it more ridiculous.

328
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It makes it more ridiculous, but really we got to end this with this,

329
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 because here we have B. Allen really revealing what the truth is.

330
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 We have this great quote.

331
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Again, let me know.

332
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 This man is in charge of exposing the truth, right?

333
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 This is how we envision these people, these fox molders of the world.

334
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Listen to this.

335
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 "Many mornings I've awakened to the faint sounds of screams and cries,

336
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 as if from men, women, and children crying out from dungeons underground."

337
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 What?

338
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Oh, yep.

339
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It's them screaming sounds again.

340
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 What time is it?

341
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Oh, man, I woke up really, really today.

342
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It's 6 a.m.

343
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Just so screaming children really didn't help me get some good REM sleep.

344
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Making some coffee, a little sound on her.

345
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 If I spent one morning and I heard a human screaming from a dungeon under my house,

346
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I'm taking care of business, right?

347
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 "Many mornings I've awakened to the faint sounds of screams and cries, as if from..."

348
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Okay, it's happening all the time.

349
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "The best part awakened up..."

350
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Anyways, he goes on.

351
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He said, "Given the chance, supposing there were a large enough militia force to carry it out..."

352
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 This is where we get into this just bizarre thought process of this guy.

353
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 "Given the chance, supposing there were a large enough militia force to carry it out,

354
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I would gladly take part in an Operation Dungeon Storm type of invasion of the underworld."

355
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 So he basically, he's admitting he won't do anything without a thousand dudes backing him up.

356
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And he has like this delusion of grandeur, which is fine.

357
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 A lot of people have delusion of grandeur.

358
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But let's say that Operation Dungeon Storm is taking place.

359
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 You're tired of waking up every morning to hearing the cries of men, women, and children in the dungeon underneath your house.

360
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And you see this guy. You see B. Allen getting suited up.

361
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Here's what he's bringing to the fight.

362
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 "Tell me this wouldn't be the most dangerous person to be..."

363
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 This would be more dangerous than being next to the reptilians.

364
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 "I would gladly take part in an Operation Dungeon Storm type of invasion of the underworld."

365
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 "Flamethrower in one hand and a 9mm semi-automatic in the other."

366
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I'm not an expert of weapons, but I'm pretty sure a flamethrower is a two-handed weapon.

367
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I don't think I would trust someone who's trying to aim down a site of a gun and also going,

368
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "Hahaha, just waving the flames back and forth."

369
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 We're in a tunnel. We're in a dungeon.

370
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 We're not in the middle of a field. We're in a dungeon.

371
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 We're in rooms built.

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 They're small. They're built to keep people prisoner.

373
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And there's women and children everywhere, right?

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You're just...

375
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That's way more dangerous.

376
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I bet you they're will be in Operation Dungeon Storm.

377
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 They're not even calling this dude.

378
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 "Flamethrower in one hand and a 9mm in another."

379
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 That's ridiculous.

380
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And then he goes on to say, he goes on to say,

381
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "Maybe one day the conditions will be ripe for such a response to the reptilian threat."

382
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But unfortunately, most people seem to be more interested in talk than action.

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 That's you, dude! That's you! I don't wake up.

384
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I'm not here and screaming people every morning.

385
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 When I wake up, that's you!

386
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 You wrote a blog about it, dude!

387
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 If you know about...

388
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Okay, let me back up here.

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I am not asking be Allen or anyone else to start walking around underground with a flamethrower.

390
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 But if you...

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You can't be like, "Pfft, but most people only prefer to talk and write a blog."

392
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You can't. That's come on, bro.

393
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 If I woke up and I heard people screaming underneath me, right, I'd be shocked.

394
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 But then I would do something about it.

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 I want to be like, "Pfft, well, I'd do something about it if there's only 1,000 other of me,

396
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 but I guess since there's not, they're all talk."

397
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 He finishes it like this.

398
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "I can't help but feel it might take a very rude awakening to motivate..."

399
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 The rude awakening is people screaming underneath your house, bro.

400
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 You have already gotten the rude...

401
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It literally wakes you up each morning.

402
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 That's a literal rude awakening.

403
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 "I can't help but feel it might take a very rude awakening to motivate the masses

404
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 to respond to the reptilian threat above, within and below."

405
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Until then, I suppose that the cries and screams of the lost will continue.

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Unquote.

407
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 "Dude, that's on you, dude, because I'm not hearing it and no one else is either."

408
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I am mad. I almost think that he probably writes his blog out.

409
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 He gets published, then he goes, "What was I doing? His memory is that bad.

410
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 He doesn't even remember."

411
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So every morning when he wakes up, he's like, "What? Where's all that screaming coming from?

412
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 I should investigate this."

413
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And he goes on this long journey.

414
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 He's looking down dark pits.

415
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 He says hi to Robert and Peter, and they're like, "Hey."

416
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And then he's like, "I gotta write a blog. For all I know, there's a thousand versions of this blog."

417
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He keeps forgetting his password. He has to keep starting new accounts.

418
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Now, to top it all off, if you didn't think that was insane enough, we gotta top this off.

419
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 With the comments, right? Usually, the comments are always twice as more insane as the post.

420
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 It's almost all... I think that should be a law.

421
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 I think that should be Carpenter's law.

422
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It's an internet law that the comment section will always be twice as insane as the original article they're commenting on.

423
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 There is a quote from a... Here's a post from someone under the name Carl Melanson.

424
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 "I go to the bookstore a lot, and I've uncovered something about Jews."

425
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I think what interests you.

426
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 So here we go. We're talking about Mormons and Reptilians and Crossroads Plaza, but nope.

427
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Carl Melanson. "I go to the bookstore a lot, and I've uncovered something about Jews that I think what interests you."

428
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 If you look on the back of certain books, you'll see that they have triangles and/or the three letters EAN near the UPC.

429
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 If you look it up on the internet, you'll find that those letters stand for European article numbering.

430
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 However, so he admits that's what it means, right?

431
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 But what does this have to do with Reptilians, Jason? Hold your horses, or hold your reptilian horses.

432
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 If you look it up on the internet, you'll find these letters stand for European article numbering.

433
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 However, I suspected that something more sinister was going on. Of course you did.

434
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 So I thought I would see if there was something about these books that would connect them in a different way.

435
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 I soon made the connection.

436
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 The symbol and/or EAN is only on the back of books written, or translated, by Reptilian Jews.

437
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Is that a thing? I've never heard that before.

438
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I've never come across that before. A Reptilian Jew.

439
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Reptilians living underground, making power plays with masons. That's old hat.

440
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 You can understand in Salt Lake City where you have a huge Mormon population, the Church of Latter-day Saints very interconnected with the government.

441
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Of course that's going to be part of that mythology. Reptilian Jews?

442
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I saw that and thought, "Is it a Reptilian who converted to Judaism?"

443
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 "Is it a Reptilian alien who came down from another Stark, came here, mausol-toved, Gada Yamaka, is now a practicing Jew?"

444
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Or are Reptilians genetically Jewish?

445
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 That's one of the most I'm-speech-I don't know what that means.

446
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 A Jewish person is either someone who practices the Jewish religion, or someone who's ethnically Jewish, or both.

447
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 What in the world is a Reptilian Jew? I honestly don't understand what that means.

448
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 I've heard conspiracies about, like, obviously Jewish, NWO, Jewish Illuminati, but I've never heard that term before. A Reptilian Jew.

449
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 I didn't think-as I was reading this article, I was having a good old belly laugh and I was like, "This is hilarious."

450
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And then I got to that and I puzzled. 100% puzzled.

451
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 But maybe that's what they want, right? Maybe that is the real conspiracy. Maybe that's the real conspiracy.

452
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Carl Melanson says, "You can tell who the Reptilian Jews are because when you're on a bus, it's no shock that this guy takes public transportation, right?"

453
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 He says that when you're on the bus, you'll look at the back of people and you go, "Are there any Reptilians here?"

454
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And then they'll turn. You don't say that out loud. If you say that out loud, people are definitely going to turn, but you think it.

455
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 You stare at the back of their head as hard as you can and you think it, you think it, you think it.

456
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Eventually when they turn around, you just look at them and you nod your head and you go, "Yep, that was a Reptilian, all right?"

457
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Makes sense, because this bus is headed to the local synagogue.

458
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 So basically if you stare at people long enough and they turn around, that means they're Reptilian.

459
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 The idea is that they can read your mind. So now we have telepathic Reptilian Jews.

460
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I'm halfway tempted to do more research on how many people believe that not Reptilians are aligned with Jews, but that Reptilian...

461
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Reptilians are now practicing the Jewish faith.

462
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I'm so tempted to find out if that is actually a real conspiracy or that's just one commenter saying that.

463
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Because when I was reading this, I was like, "Masons and Mormons and Reptilians, basic stuff."

464
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 But that's just absolutely bizarre to think that somewhere out in the galaxy right now there's a Reptilian reading the Torah and they're having debates.

465
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Actually now that I think about it, that would honestly, if we're ever going to get invaded by aliens, I hope they're Reptilian Jews

466
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 because they won't fight on the Sabbath.

467
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Like that would be basically, "We only got to hold out for four more days. Saturday's coming up soon."

468
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Everything's getting blown up.

469
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And then Saturday comes and you can't press buttons. They can't use electricity. Aliens are just kind of sitting there.

470
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 That would be kind of dope and we would just be like, "You're under arrest."

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

472
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 So if you live in Salt Lake City, and I actually know one or two of my listeners do, if you live in Salt Lake City,

473
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 you walk through the mall, crossroads, plaza one day,

474
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 you might meet a man who knows of a story about a guy's wife whose cousin used to work there.

475
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 And he took a bus once and met a Reptilian Jew.

476
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 But if you heard that story, would you remember it?

477
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
