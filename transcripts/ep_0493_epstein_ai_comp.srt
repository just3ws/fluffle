1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 A ridiculous conspiracy starts a war between conspiracy theorists.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 Then we go back to the conspiracy theory iceberg to explore the idea that before Jeffrey Epstein died,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 he was investing copious amounts of money to advance artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Is Jeffrey Epstein now living in cyberspace? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,500
 [Music]

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys have a great weekend when you're listening to this.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 This is the last episode.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'll be on vacation. I'm gonna take a week off.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Next week is going to be repeats. I don't know what the theme is gonna be yet.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hey, I'm Jason from the future here.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm jumping in real quick. I know the audio quality is not that great.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 There will not be repeats next week.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 I'm gonna see this episode's coming out and there will be no repeats next week.

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
 I just need a break.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 Even the repeats, there's a lot of work to get those episodes ready.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 I've been doing, coming up on episode 500 and I put these last 15 episodes out.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 I recorded them all over the course of about nine days.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 So I need a flat, straight, do nothing week.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So there are going to be no repeats this week.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 This is the last episode you're getting.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,500
 We'll come back on, the show will have its next episode on August 3rd.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 We'll be the next one.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 So have a great day, guys. Have a great week.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
 I am going to do nothing.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
 Absolutely nothing Dead Rabbit Radio related.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 I really need a break.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
 And then after that, I will be back home.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 But I'm recording this way in advance and I'm relaxing while you're listening to this episode.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,000
 I've had three long weeks of doing nothing but watching sci-fi channel original movies.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,500
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Duncan Allen.

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
 Duncan, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,000
 You are going to be our captain, our pilot, whatever vehicle we take you're going to be in charge of today.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay too.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 Duncan, let's go ahead. Let's start off in the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,000
 We are going to head out to your local basketball arena.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 We just go like two feet and jump off.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Now, I don't know where any basketball arenas are around in Oregon, but we're at one.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I'm sure there's one in Portland.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So we're there. People are shooting hoops.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The Portland Trail Blazers, that's a team, right?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So we show up. We're all wearing Portland Trail Blazers.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I hope they're a team. I hope they're a basketball team. I'm pretty sure they are.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 We're going to show up. We're going to be those fans that only cheer for them when they're winning.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
 Yeah, you guys rock. Look at my new tattoo.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 This was actually requested by Bud Heavy on YouTube.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 It's funny. Recently I did a sports conspiracy theory about baseballs being juiced.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 It was a picture for, I think it was the Astro, who's an Astro, his name is Verlander,

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 who thought that the MLB, they'd bought the people who made the baseballs, Rawlings, I think it was.

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,000
 And that they were making the baseballs easier to hit home runs, a conspiracy.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,500
 And a lot of you guys really liked the sports conspiracy theory, and Bud Heavy recommended this one to me.

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 I thought it was a joke. A lot of times when you guys send me conspiracy theories, I'm like, "Ah, they're just messing with me."

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 This is real. People, real. Okay. It's not real in that case. People actually believe this.

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,000
 So we're at the Portland Trail Blazers. They're shooting hoops. They're getting ready for a big game.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And we see one of the players, you know, the famous one, you know the one everyone loves?

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 He's looking around. He looks suspicious and he reaches into his pocket.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And then he starts rubbing the ball. He's rubbing the ball. The basketball. Don't get dirty.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,500
 And then he shoots it. He shoots the ball and it's like, not going to go in.

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,000
 And then we see it arc, like 90 degrees to the right and go right in the rim.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,500
 And then he looks up. He gives a thumbs up to the person in the control booth.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 And the person in the control booth has their arms crossed and they're just shaking their head menacingly.

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 And they're like, "What? What? What was that?"

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 And then the basketball player that everyone knows and loves gets down on one knee.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 Now he's normal height with us. He's like Duncan, Jason, dead rabbit radio listener.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 I'm about to blow a lid on the conspiracy theory and it's going, it's possibly going to ruin my career.

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 You know me, the most popular player on the Portland Trail Blazers.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,000
 You see, we put magnets in the ball. The ball itself. And then we see a computer generated image,

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,500
 a little 3D image of a basketball and it's like the wire mesh.

72
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 The basketball itself looks all orange and bumpy, but actually inside of it, it is orange and bumpy,

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 but inside of it's thin layers of magnets.

74
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,000
 You see, you thought the rim was simply metal because, because that's the way they designed it, but no.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,500
 So, you know the basketball hoop? We're like, "Yeah, we know what a basketball hoop is. We're not idiots."

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,000
 His eyes are looking from side to side. He's like, "You don't even know my name."

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
 Basketball hoop also has magnets in it. So what? And we're like, "What? Wouldn't it repel it?"

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 And he goes, "Tactically, yes." But you see that dude up in the booth? The guy has his arms crossed.

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 He's just been nodding the whole time, medicine-ly. He actually has a neck condition.

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 I hope he feels better. The whole game's fixed. Basketball's fixed. Every sport is fixed,

81
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 but you also have like physics and stuff to take into account.

82
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 So I will shoot the hoop and there's magnets in the ball and then the dude will hit the button up there

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 and it will attract the ball or, if we're not supposed to make the point, the magnet will shift polarity

84
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 and it will repel the ball. Every single hoop shot you see, which if that's a term,

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 is from the direction of that man. He's hitting that button.

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 There's two versions of the conspiracy theory. That's actually the most popular one.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 That there's magnets built into the ball. And what's interesting, the other one is that,

88
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 the one I originally said, you put the magnets on the ball yourself,

89
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 one of them is the player themselves are cheating the system.

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 The other one is that the whole NBA is fixed. The one with the magnets being put on the ball,

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 that actually started off as a joke. David Blaine does an ad for the NBA finals

92
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 and he's like, "Watch me make this perfect shot."

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 And he has magnets and he puts them on the ball and he makes the perfect shot

94
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 and he goes, "Look at these two players giving each other high fives.

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 That means he's getting more magnets. Don't believe me. Watch the NBA."

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 That's a joke, obviously. He's a master illusionist. He did it somehow.

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 Either he can make a shot like that or some sort of trickery.

98
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 That's where that came from. But there's a lot more people saying that the whole game is rigged

99
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 and the rim is metal. Now, what's funny about this is, when I was researching this,

100
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 this one really gets people mad. I saw more people, I saw as many people argue about this

101
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 as I see argue about flat earth. This one really makes people mad.

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 Because it basically comes down to two groups of... The flat earth thing is people who...

103
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 They go, "I've never been off the earth and you've never been off the earth

104
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 so who can say what's true?" And you're like, "Yeah, I haven't been off earth, but I understand.

105
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 I understand how spatial relations work and da-da-da-da-da." You have this argument number.

106
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 This one, and you're right, neither of us have been off the earth. You're right.

107
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 So I have to go off math and theory and you go off of observation and no math and no theory.

108
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 This one's basically more between people who have never dribbled a basketball in their life

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 and people who have. When people bring this up, people get so mad.

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 Because they go, "This is easily testable. Take a basketball, go outside, dribble it,

111
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 and start shooting hoops." And you'll understand. Because there's footage of balls landing right on the rim

112
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 and just balancing there. There's one famous one that you see in all these YouTube videos about this.

113
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 The ball, like, gets stuck back there. It gets stuck.

114
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 Now that shot was made by, like, a person trying to win a thousand dollars.

115
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 He shoots and it lands not on the rim, but on the thing that connects the rim to the backboard.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 You just sit in there and people go, "What about that, huh?"

117
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 "They're holding magnets. Holding magnets can make that work."

118
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 And people are like, "Basketballs aren't full of anything. They're air."

119
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 And so when it hits, sometimes it'll jam. They go, "You can go out and play basketball with your buddies

120
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 and weird stuff will happen." It has nothing to do with magnets. No one's hitting on magnets.

121
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 And they get really, really mad. And what's funny is some of those people who believe that there's no fix.

122
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 They may believe in Flatter. They may believe in all these other theories.

123
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 But because they've had hands-on, literal hands-on experience with the basketball conspiracy theory,

124
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 they may believe the weirdest conspiracy theories. But this one makes them mad.

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 Because they're like, "Dude, listen, I've played basketball in high school and I've seen weird stuff happen all the time.

126
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
 There's no magnets, bro. And I'll be like, "Well, you know, just asking questions."

127
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 I'm sure a lot of like 9/11 truthers who really believe that space lasers took out the Twin Towers

128
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 would get in your face if you told them that basketballs had magnets in them.

129
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Now, I'm not telling you to do that. We're not going to troll them.

130
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 But people get really, really mad when you bring this up. It's quite funny.

131
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 And let's say the 9/11 was an inside job thing. People go, "9/11 was an inside job."

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 And they're talking about thermite and all that stuff. And you'll answer those questions and they go,

133
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,500
 "Well, maybe it was space lasers." They have to evolve the mythology.

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 They've already done this with the basketballs have magnets.

135
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 Because the theory isn't just because then people go, "What about football?"

136
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 If they have magnets, people go, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

137
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 If people go, "Oh, no, no, no, footballs have magnets in them too." And they can reverse the polarity of the goalpost.

138
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 This one guy went so far to say that UFC is fixed. Now, what's funny is there's two different theories here.

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 One is that sports are fixed, which I think isn't even a conspiracy theory.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 I think you would find a lot of that may not be on a league level. It could be on a player level.

141
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 But that's not even a conspiracy theory. That's like saying it rains in Seattle.

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 You're like, "Yeah, sometimes." Did you know that in UFC, your gloves and your shoes have magnets in them?

143
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 And to make it work, that's bad enough getting punched with a magnet. And your mouth guard is made of metal.

144
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 Did you know that? Did you know that that's the reason when every UFC fight, every single punch goes straight to the jaw

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 and everyone is dead at the end of a fight and has no teeth?

146
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 People go, "Oh, no, no, no, no, it's magnets, magnets all the way down."

147
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 Magnets in your teeth and then I have maybe fillings, maybe, but you have magnets in your gloves.

148
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 So every punch, because you know, no one ever gets picked up in UFC.

149
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 No one ever gets punched in the stomach. It's always in the teeth.

150
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 And then of course, I think the puck and hockey is just one giant magnet, I think is the thing.

151
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 And they'll always show video of these one in a million shots.

152
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 I remember it's so funny, Roger Ebert wrote a review a long time ago that,

153
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 Wayne's Brothers, it was one of the Waynes, did that movie, The Sixth Man, about the guy who dies and his ghost comes back as a basketball player

154
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 and it's like helping the team win. And Roger Ebert gave the movie Zero Stars and he goes, "Listen, I can guarantee you

155
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 that basketball fans are so obsessed over the simple physics of the game.

156
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 If a ghost, if a ball was about to go in the hoop and then it did a loop-de-loop and then landed in the other team's hoop,

157
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 there would be people would be rioting in the streets."

158
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 The fact is so funny because he hit it in the movie so much, he was breaking it down on that level.

159
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 He's just like, "No one would watch a game if that happened once."

160
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 He goes, "There would be commissions brought up to figure that out and they'd be watching that footage over and over again."

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 And the movie was dumb, he gave it Zero Stars.

162
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 But that's the thing, if there were magnets in all these balls, you would have constantly, constantly,

163
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 it wouldn't be one in a million clips on you, every single clip would be, and again, in the sports section,

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 an impossible basketball shot was made.

165
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 It's really easy conspiracy theory to test, obviously, you just keep playing basketball and you'll see one in a million shots happen.

166
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 So you can easily test it just people don't want it. People want to believe that there's magnets in the basketballs for whatever reason.

167
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 Again, you can make the argument that stuff is fixed.

168
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 I've actually come across quite a few conspiracy theories involving sports.

169
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 Michael Jordan owed money to the mobs so they cut his finger off, that's one of them.

170
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 And then Michael Jordan, sorry Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan, I guess was betting on games in the NBA,

171
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 saw what happened with Pete Rose in the Major League Baseball scandal,

172
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 so they just let him go for a couple years and he went and played baseball.

173
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 They didn't want that to get out. There's been a couple stories, couple sports conspiracy theories that I've come across,

174
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 but the magnets in the basketball, I think, is the most loony-tuned conspiracy theory.

175
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 But if you guys have another one, and again, thank you, but heavy, I really thought this was a joke when you sent it over.

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 If you guys know of any other loony-tuned conspiracy theories, send them on over.

177
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 I have seen the video where Shaquille O'Neal freezes for five minutes, by the way.

178
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 That is weird. I'll put that in the show notes. He's just standing there.

179
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 He's not playing a game. It's not like the whole game's going on.

180
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 He has the ball in his hand and everyone's like, "What's going on?"

181
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 He's doing the news show. He's doing like some morning NBA show or whatever.

182
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 He's just staring at the camera. It's really creepy. It's really creepy.

183
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 It's like that Al Roker one where they said, "You need space for Jesus,"

184
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 and Al Roker froze for like two minutes on live television. Weird stuff, weird stuff.

185
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 But anyway, so the Shaquille O'Neal one will be in the show notes. I'll put the Al Roker one in the show notes, too.

186
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 I recommend watching those. They're really creepy.

187
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 Okay, so Duncan. We're done. Duncan shots. What?

188
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 Duncan's probably like, "Dude, you know, I've been hearing that joke for 20 years."

189
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 Okay, Duncan. Sorry.

190
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 So, Duncan, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter.

191
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 We're going to wave goodbye to the Portland Trail Blazers. Bye.

192
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 We're going to take off. We are headed out.

193
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 We have a giant magnet. All their balls are bouncing up towards the helicopter.

194
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 They're like, "No." The guy's still not in his head.

195
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 We're flying. He's just in and Shaq's frozen behind him.

196
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 We have -- we've stolen all the basketballs with our giant magnet.

197
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 We are flying out of the Virgin Islands. This might actually be, I think, for a long time,

198
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 the very last time I'm going to talk about Jeffrey Epstein on this show,

199
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 because we've talked about him a lot in the past week.

200
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 Talked about him -- not -- not -- I just don't like the subject matter.

201
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 Like, honestly, like, I think this is an interesting conspiracy theory.

202
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 I found an interesting angle on it. But I'm pretty done talking about Jeffrey Epstein,

203
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 unless, again, some huge news comes out with G. Lane Maxwell. I'm kind of over it.

204
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 I don't -- I don't like the subject matter. I don't like covering it on the show in general.

205
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
 I think a lot of the times you guys pick up on that when I don't go into detail with a lot of true crime stuff,

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 I don't really like the subject matter to begin with.

207
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 But I find this is an interesting -- we can -- I think Jeffrey Epstein is a weirdo, to say the least.

208
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 A pervert and a weirdo. But this story is interesting.

209
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 This is actually from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

210
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 And the phrase on the conspiracy theory iceberg is Jeffrey Epstein, A.I.

211
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 "Let's bring the helicopter nice and low. We're flying over the Virgin Islands.

212
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 We are not going to Jeffrey Epstein's Island. I don't want to be anywhere near it.

213
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,500
 We're going to land on a beautiful yacht, and we're going to be a thousand miles away,

214
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
 me and Duncan and you, sitting there, drinking my ties,

215
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 and watching the sunset in the complete opposite direction of that scumbag's island."

216
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 But this is an interesting conspiracy theory because, again, I think I found some weird stuff with it.

217
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 So Jeffrey Epstein was originally arrested in 2008, and he did like a couple months in jail.

218
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 What was interesting about that was that it was so mundane.

219
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 It was literally a dad -- I mean, the crime was horrific. I'm not saying the crime was mundane,

220
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 Jeffrey Epstein, this powerful, world-connected dude, some dad called up the police and said,

221
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 "Hey, this guy molested my daughter." And the cops were like, "Okay."

222
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 And they went and they arrested him. It was -- that was -- I didn't know it was like that.

223
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 I mean, I knew he got arrested, but it was literally like how you would catch the neighborhood pedophile.

224
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 Despite all of his contacts and everything, he got picked up pretty easily.

225
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 And he did a couple months in jail and then was released on work release.

226
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,500
 And the cops were like, "This guy -- they said that he was probably the most prolific child molester they'd ever come across."

227
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 They were saying in U.S. history, but, you know, he had -- he did have connections,

228
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 but the fact that he got arrested in the first place was odd.

229
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 I thought it was like a long investigation. Some dad called up.

230
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
 They may have been a long investigation after that phone call, but it was literally --

231
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 I thought they would have just blown it off or give the dad money or something like that.

232
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 So he did get arrested, though, in 2008. I want to say this, too, before I go any further.

233
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 I was in a photo with Jeffrey Epstein. Everyone who came in contact with Jeffrey Epstein,

234
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 everyone who was on one of his foundations, something like that,

235
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 I do not believe that every single person that's associated with Jeffrey Epstein knew what he did.

236
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 I think -- I think there was -- it was like a Harvey Weinstein thing.

237
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 There were people who absolutely knew what he was doing.

238
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 And then you heard rumors, and then there were people who had no idea.

239
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 Because one of the guys that he rolled with, no pun intended, was Stephen Hawking.

240
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 Stephen Hawking got a ton of money from Jeffrey Epstein,

241
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 because Jeffrey Epstein was donating millions of dollars to all sorts of science programs,

242
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 including individual scientists.

243
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 Do I think Stephen Hawking was engaged in this behavior? No, I don't.

244
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 Do I think Elon Musk was engaged in this behavior? No, I don't.

245
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 I think there's -- and I could list all the people I do think or might think,

246
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 that's not what this show is about. But what I'm seeing, because Elon Musk says that he got photo bombed by Ghislaine Maxwell,

247
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 I don't think that every single person that came across Jeffrey Epstein is involved in this,

248
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 because I'm going to talk about companies, and I am in no way implying, or whatever implying,

249
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 that the companies that he donated money to was involved in his disgusting lifestyle in any way, shape, or form.

250
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 I think for the most part he kept it hidden.

251
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
 I think there were powerful people he was connected with who knew.

252
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 I think there were people on the outsider who heard rumors, and then there's people who'd have no idea.

253
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 In 2008, you would know, or you would have a whisper.

254
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 The rumors came a little more true. Ah, no, I was just some dad.

255
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 So in 2000, though, before any of this stuff was really coming to light,

256
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 Jeffrey Epstein starts the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation.

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 VI does not mean six in Roman numerals.

258
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 VI stands for Virgin Islands, which is where Epstein Island was located.

259
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 So right off the bat, super gross.

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 So what does Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation do?

261
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 He gives Harvard a ton of money to set up the program for evolutionary dynamics.

262
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 They start working on how math, how mathematical formulations work in evolution.

263
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 He's donating money to them.

264
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 He supports this YouTube channel called NeuroTV,

265
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 and he would bring on philosophers and psychologists, and they would talk about how the brain function.

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 That's gone, by the way. All the videos are gone.

267
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 The YouTube channel is gone. It's completely ghost.

268
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 As a representative of the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, he was allowed to sit on these other boards.

269
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 He was also a member of the Trilateral Commission, and he was a member of Council for Foreign Relations.

270
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 Trilateral Commission and Council for Foreign Relations is boomer conspiracy theory.

271
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 I was 12 when I was reading about the Trilateral Commission.

272
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 I was literally, where 30 years ago I was reading about how they were taken over the world,

273
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 Council for Foreign Relations taken over the world, Bilderberg Group.

274
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 I was aware of all that stuff before a lot of you guys was born, and I'm not trying to flex on you.

275
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 I'm just saying those were really old school conspiracy theory groups.

276
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 So again, I'm not saying Harvard is part of this. I'm not saying Trilateral Commission.

277
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 I can't believe I'm defending. You asked me 30 years ago, Jason,

278
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 "Are you ever going to defend Trilateral Commission and Council for Foreign Relations?"

279
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 On a podcast, I'd be like, "What's a podcast?"

280
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 But I'd go, "Well, no, because they're these... I just think... I don't know if they have my best interests at heart.

281
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,500
 I think they are high, high-level international groups.

282
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
 I don't know if they care about Jason Carpenter, but I'm not also going to paint them with the brush,

283
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 because they have a pedophile in here.

284
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 Any more so... Here's a perfect example. Any more so than the head of Subway hiring Jared Fogel,

285
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 or even the advertising camera crew with Jared Fogel, or his personal assistant.

286
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 Like, at a certain point, do you hold Jared Fogel's accountant?

287
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 Do you think he was involved, or she shouldn't be sexist, but do you think they were involved in his disgusting habits?

288
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 And we have a tendency to do that with every time a photo pops up of Jeffrey Epstein.

289
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 People go, "Ah! Matt Groening flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane. Do I think Matt Groening...

290
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 And the girl who actually is one of the main witnesses of Virginia Guffrey?"

291
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 She said that she had to give Matt Groening a foot massage.

292
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 And people were like, "Whoa! Look at Matt Groening's arm to the lady to express."

293
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 Even that girl, that's the only thing she knows about Matt Groening.

294
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 Yeah, he flew on the plane and gave him foot massages and his feet were gross.

295
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 That was kind of the end of the story.

296
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 So just because people are associated with Jeffrey Epstein does not necessarily make them complicit in the primes.

297
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 It's definitely not a good look, right? It's definitely not a good look.

298
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 I just mentioned on an episode this week, Steel, Sharp and Steel.

299
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 This is the kind of thing I'm talking about. You've got to watch out who you're in company with.

300
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 But I realize I'm preaching now. Let's get on with this.

301
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 Jeffrey Epstein is head of the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation and allows him to sit on all these boards.

302
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 The dude has a ton of money. We still don't even know how he got his money.

303
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 They say he was a hedge fund manager. He had one client.

304
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 I personally think he got the bulk of his money by running this human trafficking thing, this prostitution ring.

305
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 I think people, I see, again, I have put another copy on there.

306
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 I do think he had high level clients that were engaging in this sicko behavior.

307
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 But I don't think it's every single person he ever took a photo.

308
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 But I do think he was making money doing it.

309
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 And I think there are very, very powerful people.

310
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 There are his clientele world powerful people.

311
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,500
 I'm just not saying it's not every powerful person he's ever worked with.

312
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 Defending the trilateral commission.

313
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 Anyways, as a representative of the foundation, he sat on the mind, brain and behavior advisory committee at Harvard.

314
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 He was also involved with the Santa Fe Institute.

315
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 They're a massive think tank. They're doing basically their job is to sit around and think of the future.

316
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 Think of the way that all these things are going to impact stuff.

317
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 So he's focused on technology. He's focused on science.

318
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 One of the big things I want to focus on is a group called OpenCog.

319
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 They were working on an open source AI program. This was fascinating.

320
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 They wanted to build an AI that you could then implant into a robot.

321
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 And they set it up like this. They call it "atom space."

322
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 There's thousands of atoms in atom space, which would be this virtual avatar.

323
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 The problem they go, the problem with the way that we're doing machine learning versus the way humans learn,

324
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 is that humans learn, "Oh, I have a fun time when I'm recording a podcast, but it hurts my back."

325
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 A robot will really just be like, "Record podcast would be the first command.

326
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 Second command would be input joy, level three.

327
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 And then it's a level five. I love doing this show, but out of five.

328
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 But then it's like back hurts, 30 percent."

329
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 You know, humans, though, associate memories, smells.

330
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 We walked down the street, we smell, we feel the wind on our face.

331
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 We associate that with playing in great grandma, McGee's backyard.

332
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 We have association. So what OpenCog was trying to do,

333
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 and one of the things they thought they were trying to also use it for video games, the super advanced AI,

334
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 that it would combine things like objects, actions, and feelings.

335
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 Here's a quote from one of the articles I read. I'm sorry, I don't know.

336
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 I think it was actually from Jeffrey Epstein's blog. We'll get into that in a second, but here's this quote.

337
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 "Every time a character encounters objects or concepts in its environment,

338
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 a new atom is created in that character's atom space.

339
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 Associations are also recorded as a character moves from one concept to another.

340
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 Upon repetition, associative links get stronger, influencing a character's pathway choices,

341
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 and building associative memory."

342
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 Have you guys ever played Fear? It's a video game.

343
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 First encounter response, I think is what it stands for.

344
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 It's basically the movie, The Ring, but it's also a first person shooter.

345
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 It's a phenomenal video game. I've replayed it multiple times.

346
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 It's too scary for me now, too spooky.

347
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 But the AI in that game, even the game came out in the early 2000s.

348
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 The AI in that game is still considered to be top notch.

349
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 Characters, they're villains. You're fighting against other armed characters.

350
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 They get scared. They'll outflank you. They go into a room and they know that they're outgunned.

351
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 They'll go through another door. They'll flip a table over, hide behind it, and wait until you appear.

352
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 It's a fascinating AI. I watched the whole video on just how they programmed that.

353
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 What OpenCog wanted to do was something like that, where you would have a video game character

354
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 be able to exhibit fear, read the room, figure out the best way to go.

355
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 Should it just run off to a different part of the level and wait for you there?

356
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 In fear, they'd call in reinforcements. It's amazing. OpenCog wanted to go past that.

357
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 But they weren't only focused on video games. Obviously, that would be a huge moneymaker.

358
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 Imagine a game like GTA V where your notoriety rises over time.

359
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 You start off playing the game and you piss off the cops.

360
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Eventually, you get the wanted star level and stuff like that.

361
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 Then it goes away after a certain point. What if over time, your actions in the game made pedestrians afraid of you?

362
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 People were moving through the city differently depending on if you were coming down the street.

363
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 If they recognized you, you'd have to constantly change your clothes.

364
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 Hitman kind of did something like that. But in an open world game, everything's constantly evolving.

365
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 Or if you're a hero, if you're doing stuff that people like, people start giving you high fives or giving you money.

366
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 A living world, that's kind of what OpenCog was looking at.

367
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 But they didn't want to just limit it to a video game world.

368
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 They wanted to try to get this into the body of an android.

369
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 Machine learning through associations.

370
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 That was actually, I'm looking farther down my notes as I'm going through,

371
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 the quote that I gave you was from a Forbes article that was taken down, actually used the way back machine.

372
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 Forbes article, "Science funder Jeffrey Epstein launches radical emotional software for the gaming industry."

373
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 That's how that was explained.

374
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 We have that. So we're looking again at the conspiracy theory iceberg, Jeffrey Epstein AI.

375
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 So we have that. We had interest in AI. Is that enough to appear on the conspiracy theory iceberg? Maybe.

376
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 But let's table that for a second.

377
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 He also had an interest in cryogenics. He had an interest in freezing his brain.

378
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 He had a specifically an interest in freezing his brain and his penis.

379
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 He believed in eugenics. What's funny was that was actually a concern as well.

380
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
 People go, "Yeah, he got accused of this girl who was like 14 or 15.

381
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 He got accused of doing something inappropriate and he served a couple months in jail and that's awful."

382
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 But, and I'm not adding the but, that's awful, but he also supports eugenics.

383
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 So as a scientist, should you take money from someone who supports eugenics?

384
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,500
 So the scientists are looking at it and they go, "Listen, I need money to do my research.

385
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 I don't really care where it comes from." I'm sure some of them would say,

386
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 "No, I'm not saying Stephen Hawking said that. I'm not saying Stephen Hawking's like,

387
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
 'Dollard, dollar, bill, y'all, I don't care where it's at.'

388
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 Some people probably didn't walk away from the money, but he had millions of dollars to give.

389
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 And again, no one really knows where it comes from. I think it was from trafficking.

390
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 I think it was from human trafficking. But he wanted to freeze his head.

391
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 He wanted to freeze his penis. He wanted to have a baby ranch, which is a great name for a band,

392
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,500
 but it's a horrible idea to have in real life. He wanted to impregnate 20 women at a time

393
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 and have them spread his seed through the world. He's just going to have this ranch.

394
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 Maybe they'd be free range, pregnant women. We don't know.

395
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 Maybe he's a true environmentalist at heart. He can let them go out during the day

396
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 and then rustle them up back at night. But he wanted to have a baby ranch.

397
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 That hasn't, you know, it's interesting. I said, or was about to say, that hasn't happened.

398
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 But then I realized, we don't know. World's a big place. And when you have that much money, we don't know.

399
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 There could be an Epstein baby ranch somewhere out there. That's funny.

400
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 I just realized, I just kind of caught myself. They were 100% that could exist.

401
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 So conspiracy theory iceberg, Jeffrey Epstein, AI. I think we could take a look at this.

402
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,500
 He's interested in cryogenics. He's interested in artificial intelligence.

403
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 He died in a way that kept his brain undamaged.

404
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 Broken bones in his neck, which occur in 25% of lean-in hangings.

405
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 He died in a way that kept his brain from being destroyed.

406
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 He didn't get shot. He didn't get gas. He didn't get electrocuted. He didn't get shived.

407
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 He didn't fall off a cliff. So I think we can look at the conspiracy theory iceberg as this.

408
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 His brother ended up claiming his body, taking Jeffrey Epstein's body after the autopsy.

409
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 And the body is now buried in a, I believe it's Florida graveyard, but I could be wrong on the state.

410
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 We can do the conspiracy theory thing where his brain is removed even during the autopsy,

411
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 because he had money ready to go. He had a will. Everyone knew exactly what they were getting.

412
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 Guillain is trying to get some money for her legal expenses from his estate right now.

413
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 Because they broke up in like the 90s. Like they hung about and she allegedly helped him do.

414
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 I have to say allegedly with her because she's still alive.

415
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 Hopefully she lives a long life and we figure out what's going on.

416
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 But she wasn't around the whole time. So she's not in the will.

417
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 But anyways, we can say that there was payments made and his brain was removed during the autopsy

418
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 and taken to some secure location that only a millionaire could ever possibly afford.

419
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 Staffed with medical techs that were going to be paid through the will and they take Jeffrey Epstein's brain,

420
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 they put it in that cryogenic chamber.

421
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 [imitates explosion]

422
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 All the electrodes hooked up to that gray matter and the program starts running.

423
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,500
 You see, he wasn't trying to create a virtual world for video games or a virtual world for robots.

424
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 He's trying to create a virtual world for himself.

425
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:00,500
 He was obsessed with cryogenics, with eugenics, with living on past your time and leaving a legacy past your time.

426
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 And now he exists in a virtual world.

427
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 Not only a virtual world, but a virtual world that is populated with people who are constantly learning, like humans.

428
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 It would be no fun being trapped in a virtual world full of robots being trapped in a virtual world of automatons.

429
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 You'd want to be trapped in a virtual world, if you're going to be trapped in a virtual world.

430
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 Trapped in a virtual world that seems real and for it to seem real, the hardest part to simulate is other people.

431
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 You can simulate a sunset, you can simulate a waterfall, can you simulate another person?

432
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 If you work on the technology, you can.

433
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 So Jeffrey Epstein in our world may have escaped justice by "killing" himself, right?

434
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 But in the virtual world, that's what he planned all along.

435
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 He knew eventually he was going to die, and whether it was by his own hands in his jail cell, whether it was an assassin in his jail cell.

436
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 That was a better way out than dying on a bunk in the middle of the night or getting shivved in the lunch line.

437
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 He could live in the virtual world, the virtual world he created.

438
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
 A virtual world where everyone loved him.

439
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,500
 A virtual world where his victims were extremely lifelike.

440
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 It would be the perfect world for a narcissist like Jeffrey Epstein to live in.

441
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
 But there's no such thing as a perfect world.

442
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:31,500
 You know, it's really interesting. I planned on ending the episode like that.

443
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 But I came across some information when I was researching this.

444
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 I found Jeffrey Epstein's blog.

445
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 I found it profoundly fascinating.

446
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 Now, the blog, it's in the show notes.

447
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 There was nothing like, "Today I met with Hillary Clinton. Oh, what a delicious toddler we devoured. Adrienna Crone for life!"

448
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 It was posts about his business.

449
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:00,500
 It was posts about these different AI things he was working on or some program here and there.

450
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:08,500
 And at first I thought maybe it's run by someone in his company doing out press releases and stuff like that.

451
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:16,500
 The reason why I don't think it was was because Jeffrey Epstein, it's his name listed as the person writing the article,

452
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 his photos used for the article, and obviously anyone could do that. You could have a spokesperson do that.

453
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 But I think he wrote it. I think he wrote it.

454
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 And I think it's kind of an interesting insight into Jeffrey Epstein.

455
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 Now, when I say wrote it, I think he was probably posting press releases that somebody else wrote.

456
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 It was on Blogger. And it's official in the sense like, "I got it."

457
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 You could be like, "Well, I can start a Blogger account. I got it from Jeffrey Epstein's website."

458
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 You have to go through the web archives, the Wayback Machine.

459
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 Jeffrey Epstein Foundation, Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation's website, had under the, I think it was the contact tab or whatever,

460
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 blog, his personal email address is on there, and the blog.

461
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 This blog was being written in 2013. So this was after his first arrest.

462
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,500
 He's writing these posts. And this is another reason why.

463
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 I think about it. Let's say it was your job to write, let's say that some non-totally scuzz back.

464
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 Let's say that Chris Evans gets you to write his blog.

465
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 Right? And you're allowed to use his name and his, and he goes, "You know, just draw him up, support for stuff I'm doing."

466
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
 You would work your butt off to make sure people were visiting that blog, right?

467
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 You want it just right out in the empty sphere, knowing someday Chris Evans is going to go,

468
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 "Hey, how's my blog going?" And you're like, "Oh, it's great. No one visits it, but, you know, it's totally cool."

469
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 What? Why am I paying you to do my blog if no one's visiting it?

470
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 You'd at least fake it. You'd go to Fiverr and have someone fake two hits.

471
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,500
 Nobody visited Jeffrey Epstein's blog. It's so sad.

472
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 If he wasn't a disgusting monster, it would be a little heartbreaking.

473
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 Here is a man who was donating millions of dollars to businesses and charities and individuals,

474
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,500
 and nobody visited his blog.

475
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,500
 The first blog entry I found was about this AI program. He was talking about the AI program.

476
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 And then I go down to the comments section. Here's a guy who knows presidents.

477
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 Saddle in the trilateral commission, council of foreign relations, new celebrities,

478
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 saw Matt Groening with no shoes on, one comment on his blog.

479
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:32,500
 It was from Jeffrey Epstein. All it said was, "Just checking out the comments section."

480
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 Remember when you were in high school and you tried setting up your blog?

481
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,500
 Or you were in college and you were working on that story on Wattpad?

482
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 Nervously pressed the publish button and waited to see what the response would be.

483
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 Five weeks later, maybe ten hits, no comments.

484
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,500
 I mean, it sucked, right? We all went through that.

485
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 My first 20 episodes, I probably had 14 listens each episode.

486
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 But I've done other stuff. I've had blogs that have just failed.

487
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 Started a blog, never took off.

488
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,500
 It's weird, huh? Because you don't think of somebody as rich and powerful as Jeffrey Epstein,

489
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 caring enough about his blog to checking on the comments section.

490
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,500
 There was an older post where somebody is talking about some program and it was like paragraph after paragraph of some program

491
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 they were working on with Jeffrey Epstein. But that's it.

492
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:33,500
 Jeffrey Epstein was a devastatingly lonely man, and I'm not using that as an excuse.

493
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,500
 I think actually he had a fear of adult women. I think there are different types of pedophiles.

494
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,500
 Some people have just an attraction to kids and it's super gross.

495
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 None of it is understandable.

496
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 Some people, they can go, "Yeah, since I was 12, I never stopped being attracted to 12-year-olds."

497
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,500
 I think Jeffrey Epstein was somebody. So the reports are he had an egg-shaped penis.

498
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 We started the week off with an egg story. We're ending it.

499
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 Jeffrey Epstein is reportedly from victims of his. He says that he has an egg-shaped penis.

500
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 I can't even visualize that.

501
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 I think any adult woman would obviously have a hard time not laughing at that.

502
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,500
 I think if I had an egg-shaped penis, I would be nervous to have sex with women.

503
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 And then you're paying prostitutes and you still hear them snicker.

504
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 Not all of us have perfect bodies, right? None of us have perfect bodies, except Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling.

505
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:40,500
 But we deal with it. We deal with what we have and then if we can work on it and make it stronger or leaner or bigger,

506
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
 or however you want your body to be, we can do that.

507
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,500
 Egg-shaped penis, it's hard but not insurmountable. Someone can still love you.

508
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:56,500
 But for someone who's so rich and powerful, I think the only people who would accept him would be people who had no sexual experience whatsoever,

509
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:04,500
 who didn't know any better, that that was that. Not excusing it, 100% not excusing it, obviously.

510
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 But I think in the end he was a profoundly lonely and disturbed person.

511
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,500
 And even though he was giving millions of dollars out to people, people would still not visit his ball.

512
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:26,500
 Even if it was run by an intern, that's still weird. But I know I wouldn't let, if I got an intern or an assistant or something like that,

513
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,500
 I would not let them use my photo in my name. But could be wrong on that.

514
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:39,500
 You can check out the blog yourself. It seems like I got the feeling that that was his blog.

515
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,500
 I got the feeling that that was his personal thing.

516
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,500
 But even if it wasn't, people just didn't want to interact with him. They wanted his money.

517
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 He's gross. I mean, I don't blame them. But on his side, he was lonely.

518
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 And to add to all this, he died alone in his cell. Now, if he was murdered, your murderer doesn't count, right?

519
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,500
 You're still dying alone. There may be another human in there strangling you.

520
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 And I'm always kind of, I feel bad for hedging my bets on that one. But I honestly don't know.

521
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
 Like, that's something that I feel like I waffle on and I don't like waffling that much.

522
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 But I honestly, I don't know. He's dead. We know the end result.

523
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 But whether he killed himself, whether he was forced to kill himself, or whether someone else killed him, the end result was, he didn't face justice.

524
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 Not only did he die alone, his legacy was destroyed. Not only is his name synonymous with one of the most vile crimes that a human can commit.

525
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:50,500
 To avoid his grave getting defaced, he's at an unmarked grave in this graveyard.

526
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:59,500
 And he was buried next to his parents. And just so people couldn't go, well, let's just look for his parents and deface the gravestone next to it.

527
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:07,500
 They had parents gravestones removed and they are now also at unmarked graves. He destroyed his family.

528
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:15,500
 His brother had to come down and pick up the body. Had to have the family names removed from the tombstones.

529
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:23,500
 A deeply disturbed person, certainly. Who wanted to spread his seed around the world and live forever.

530
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:36,500
 But I think at some point he realized that what's the point in living forever if in this lifetime right now, even the people you give money to, don't care about you.

531
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,500
 And I think that kind of makes me lean more towards the suicide thing.

532
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:51,500
 Because if he had absolutely no real friends in the real world while he was a millionaire, he knew now that he was behind bars facing serious crimes.

533
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:01,500
 He was 100% alone. If his money didn't buy him real friendships on the outside, it's definitely not going to buy him anything while he's locked up.

534
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
 When he's toxic, no one wants to be near him.

535
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:16,500
 So if Jeffrey Epstein is lost in cyberspace somewhere, he's still trapped in a world that hates him, that actively hates him.

536
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,500
 He may have his perfect AI playground that he exists in, but he has to know it's all an illusion.

537
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:35,500
 He has to know that people despised him when he was alive, ignored him when he was imprisoned, and now simply mock him in death.

538
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:47,500
 There is no more fitting legacy for a man like Jeffrey Epstein, a monster of the modern age.

539
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:55,500
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also hit us up at facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

540
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,500
 Twitter is @deadrabbitradio. I just recorded all my episodes, baby. I'm going on vacation. Woo, woo!

541
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:08,500
 Hey guys, I hope you have fun listening to these episodes. I'm just going to be so relaxed. I'm going to be so relaxed.

542
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,500
 I'm not talking about Jeffrey Epstein no more. I'm just going to be so relaxed.

543
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:18,500
 This has been a whirlwind. If you guys knew how much work I put in these past...

544
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,500
 But thank you for sticking with the show. I got all my episodes recorded. I get to take three weeks off.

545
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,500
 I love you guys. Maybe I'll see some of you on the Minecraft server. Maybe the world in and in while these episodes are airing.

546
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,500
 I love you guys and I will see you in one week, your time, in the future time.

547
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,500
 There's a week of repeats and then I'll see you. I love you guys. Have a great weekend. Bye.

548
