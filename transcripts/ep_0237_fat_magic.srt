1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 What happens when magic and weight loss collide?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we travel to South Africa to take a look at a mean-spirited little demon.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Now this creature has roots and folklore and at first glance is easily explained away.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 But if it's just a myth, how did it murder 15 people today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Do you know what it's like? Actually, I'm a rock big doll.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot to cover and it's really hot.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Dude, we're back to that.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Okay, so the show started back in, I think it was June 13th, June 14th around there of last year.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Today's what? I'm recording this on the 9th.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Oh no, I gotta do an anniversary show. I do not have that planned. I have my regular show's planned, but not that one.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Anyways, if you listen to the early episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm constantly being like, "Oh my god, it's so hot.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I had to shut all my windows and shut my fans off."

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 But here I am recording this podcast that 14 people listen to.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Here we are a year later and we get a thousand daily listeners.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 A thousand people a day listen to the show across all platforms.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Listen to it on Twitter, listen to it on the website, listen to it through podcast apps, listen to it on YouTube.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 A thousand listens a day. Crazy.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 That's awesome. That's amazing.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And we can only go up from here. We can only go up from here.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So everyone just keep recommending the show, play it really loud and obnoxiously in your homeroom class,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 or on the bus, and other people will first be annoyed and then go, "That show is quite entertaining."

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 What's the name of that? And you turn to them and go, "Radio. Dead Rabbit Radio."

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And they're like, "Oh, it's very interesting." I don't know why you said it like that.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So anyways, but let's go ahead. We're coming up to that and I didn't plan for that.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I have just other... We have a great week this week though. We got some good stuff.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Speaking of good stuff, let's go ahead and start with this first one.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 This first one may come off as a little insensitive and I'm fully aware of that.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I'm fully aware of that. Now I'm going to drop onto like, I'm going to lose 100 listeners after this one.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Okay, so there was... I've talked before about doing stuff on conspiracies.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 This one's not a conspiracy I believe in, but it's an observation I've made over the years.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And then today I was scrolling through 4chan, the Paranormal Board on 4chan,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and I've thought about covering it in the past, but today I see on 4chan someone actually asked this question.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 It was very... The thread only had like 9, 7 people. I think 7 people were responding to it.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 It was a dead thread. But I was like, "Okay, I got to cover it today because I've been wondering this myself as well."

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 The thread is this. This is the question. And again, I... Okay, let me just say the question.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's been my observation, my personal observation and this dude on 4chan.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And also all across the internet. I keep trying to spread the blame.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 When I was doing research for this topic, it's all a bunch of other people are asking the same question.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I'm going to put this in the most polite ways possible.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 There seems to be a correlation between women who practice Wiccan stuff. Wicca? Wicca, I guess is the term.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Women who practice Wicca. And it's like a Venn diagram, those same women being overweight.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Now, not all of them are, but a good proportion of them.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And it got to the point that I just heard 100 people shut off the podcast.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I remember in college, I could almost pinpoint the girls who were getting into Wiccan magic because they were gaining weight.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And it wasn't the freshman 15. They were putting on a considerable amount of weight.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And first it just happened. I would meet this girl, we'd be hanging out and she put on 15 pounds, 20 pounds, 30 pounds.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And then she tells me she's a Wiccan. She just started discovering it. I was like, "Oh, this is interesting."

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 That happened so many times that I remember I was talking to this girl. She was putting on weight.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm thinking, "Okay, now here's the test. Here's the test. I bet you she's going to come out as a Wiccan."

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And maybe a couple months later, she's like, "You know, I've really been reading all this stuff about Wiccan stuff."

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And I was like, "Mhmm." "Theory proven." Now, let me say right off the bat, there's nothing...

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with being overweight. I'm overweight myself.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So I'm not like, "Oh, those people are so disgusting. They need to lose weight."

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I'm not saying that at all. It's whatever. It's unhealthy. It's not good for your body.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It's not good for your body to be overweight.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Whatever else you want to talk about, body image or stuff like that, it's just not healthy.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I was 350 pounds a little over a year ago and it's not good for your body. I'm 270 now and my body's still like, "Dude, get some of this off of me."

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So I'm not trying to shame the way that they look, but it's not good for your body.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But so that aside, there does seem to be a correlation between people who practice the Wiccan religion and gaining weight.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It's not that fat people choose to be Wiccans. It's that people who are not fat...

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 (laughs)

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 People who are not fat seem to gain weight as they start to become Wiccan.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Now, I don't know why this is. I don't know why this is. I've thought about it for decades.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Like, is there a correlation between the two? I actually did some recent...

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 The 4chan thread basically had three theories.

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 One, that these girls who can't compete with the hot girls and they're chubby anyways, they become Wiccans.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That doesn't wash because I've seen women gain weight while looking into the religion.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 The other theory was that these people are already again overweight and they lack the willpower to lose weight, but they want to be special.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Neither of those wash for me. Neither of those wash.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And of course, you know, there's overweight people of all religions.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So neither of those really washed for me.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And then the third theory 4chan said was more people are overweight in general.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Therefore, you may notice more overweight.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But again, I've been noticing this since the 90s.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So I remember thinking maybe there was a correlation between gaining weight, being overweight and having magical powers.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I mean, like, maybe there was some correlation between it.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I do believe this, that people tell me I tend to look younger than I actually am.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I think a lot of that has to do with my personality and the way that I act.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But a lot of people think that I look younger than I actually am.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I think that fat people tend to look younger because their face is fuller with fat.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 They don't develop wrinkles as quickly as thin people do.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So I do think that's a byproduct of being overweight.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 A good byproduct? I mean, you also die younger.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So, I mean, it's a trade-off.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But is there a correlation between people being overweight and having more access to magical powers?

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Now, of course, for that thing, you would have to admit that Wiccans have any sort of real magical powers,

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 which I am not.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I think that out of all of the paths to magic, you have like the Kabbalah,

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 or you have like, you know, the left-hand path or Chaos Magic,

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 or the mythanthropic, Luciferian order.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I don't know if they're magicians. They're just losers.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The idea is that out of all of those, I think Wiccan is the most hallmark version of those.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It's the most, like, you know what I mean? Like, it's the most generic, cheesy music,

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 low production level of magic you can possibly have.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Wiccan is the magic equivalent of a lifetime movie of the week.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 It's just black.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So, I don't necessarily--and then--so, no, I don't think Wiccans have magical powers,

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 so I don't necessarily think that being overweight would give you more access.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 However, now that I say that, I'm wondering if by being fatter,

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 since weight is proportional to how much gravitational pull that you have,

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 maybe actually being physically bigger gives you more pull on the universe around you.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And, actually, now that we're on this thing,

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 it's that the reason why overweight people can continue to get overweight

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 because basically their hyper-sigil is their overweight body,

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 and I'm not making a joke here right now. I'm actually--I think I've kind of tuned into something.

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 If their overweight body is their hyper-sigil, which is basically their power of attraction,

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 but all they're attracting is more food, they will continue to get bigger and bigger,

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 which will give them a better ability to attract more food to them.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And it's funny that I say that because now when I think about it,

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 when you see, like, those 600-pound men sitting in beds,

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 and people go, "Someone has to feed them. Like, who is feeding this person? They're killing this person."

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 It could be that the law of attraction, they're basically--because you are a bigger person,

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 you have a bigger gravitational pull on the universe around you,

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 you can actually--your power of attraction is stronger than, say, like Gwyneth Paltrow's.

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And this sounds totally ridiculous, but I actually am starting to take this a little more seriously.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Your power of attraction is greater than someone who's super skinny,

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 but your power of attraction is only based on the need of getting more food,

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 and it just keeps coming to you. Like, you're basically--the bigger you get,

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 you're resorting to an animalistic--I'm not saying obese people are cattle.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Maybe you're hunger over--let's say if you had a 600-pound guy who really wanted to be, like, Elvis Presley,

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 which, I mean, okay, that was Elvis Presley. Say you had a 600-pound guy who really wanted to be the world's greatest artist,

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 but--and you always painted and you always, like, try to focus in on being a successful artist,

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 or that was always secondary to how hungry he was every two hours and how much more food he needed.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So maybe there is a--maybe there is a correlation between being overweight and not necessarily Wiccan magic,

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 which is the same thing as just made-up wishes, but maybe you have, like, more of a pull.

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So technically, as these girls--maybe I'm wrong, maybe Wiccan stuff is real,

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 and maybe as these girls are steady in magic and they're building their influence up,

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 they're subconsciously gaining weight because they need more weight to cast better spells.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So I know there was kind of circular logic. Again, I'm not a huge fan of Wiccan stuff,

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 but I'm gonna go back to my main point, there does seem to be a correlation between being overweight

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 or gaining--I think the term is this--is gaining weight and joining the Wiccan religion.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Not necessarily being overweight and wanting to put on a pointy hat and fly around in a broom.

136
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's not that, it's the fact that I've met women who had a healthy body weight

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 and then they got bigger at the--they explored the Wiccan theology.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Now, all of that being said, that incredibly long rant going on, I do have to say this.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 As I was researching this, I found a Wiccan spell for weight loss,

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 and I remember seeing that link and I was like--because I typed in magic fat or fat magicians or something,

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 and it was all like, "This new magic pill will help you lose fat."

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But in all of that, Google is not my friend in all of that, I found full moon magic,

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 a weight loss spell to flush the fat, and I thought, "Okay, what could this possibly be?

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 What possibly could this spell be about?" It starts off with a pretty good analogy,

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 and this is something that people who struggle with weight loss really have to deal with.

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 They say, "Imagine there's a pile of bricks in your backyard and you gotta move them."

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Now, the easiest thing would be to move all the bricks at once, but you can't do that.

148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 You have to remove small portions of the bricks at a time, or really one brick at a time, however you want to put it.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And over time, those bricks will be removed from your backyard.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 That's the best way to look at weight loss. It's a day by day thing.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 You just keep making decisions--good decisions, eat less, exercise more.

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 That applies for like 90% of the people out there.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 There are people who have medical conditions that doesn't work for them,

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 but for most people, eat less, exercise more.

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So, it's a struggle, but you can do it, just like you can get all those bricks off your lawn.

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Okay, so someone who has less bricks on their lawn takes them a less amount of time.

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 You get the analogy, I don't have to keep going anyway.

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So anyways, this author says--and I'm like, "Okay, that's fair."

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Then the author goes, "Okay, so the first step, you want to fast."

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Now, this author definitely knows her audience.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Her audience is overweight Wiccans.

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Her audience is overweight Wiccans.

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So, she says, "This is one of my problems with magic."

164
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 She goes, "Okay, so first off, you have to do is you have to fast."

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Now, if you can't fast, you do a light fast with liquid only.

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 No sugar.

167
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 But if you can't do no sugar, you can put honey in your drinks.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And if you can't just have a liquid fast, you can have a salad.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But you can only put on a squirt of lemon or just a tiny splash of vinegar and olive oil.

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Here's the thing, if it's magic, it should be precise.

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It shouldn't be like, "Well, do this, but if you can't, do this other thing."

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And if you can't fast and you can't drink water for a day without putting honey--honey?

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Honey, the thickest of all sugars.

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You're going to put honey in your tea.

175
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Because you can drink tea, but if you can't drink unsweetened tea for a day,

176
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 you do not have the willpower to lose weight over time.

177
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And if you can't even go on a liquid fast, not even for a day for eight hours,

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 then you're going to make a salad.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Come on, dude, they're going to put ranch dressing all over it.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 You know who this is written for.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 You know what it's written for.

182
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Just say right off the bat, "If you want the spell to work, don't eat for eight hours."

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Nothing.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Just don't do it.

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Step two, don't give them all these outs.

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Anyway, step two, you got to get your supplies together.

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I laughed out loud when I read the first supply, because I thought,

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 "I have no idea where this is going."

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 To cast a spell to lose weight, the first supply you need is a brand new--can't be used--

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 a brand new roll of toilet paper.

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And I thought, "All bets are off."

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 All bets are off.

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 What could this spell possibly be about?

194
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You need a new roll of toilet paper?

195
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 You need pomegranate or lime.

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Pomegranate or lime.

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And they spelled it granite.

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Pomegranate.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Now, you're thinking, "Jason, you are such a hypocrite.

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You make so many errors during your--"

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Yeah, yeah.

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But I'm not casting--

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I'm not teaching people to cast a spell.

204
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Mike, well, I guess now I am, but you--

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 if you're telling--

206
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 you should be precise when you're invoking gods and demons.

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Your spelling should be on point when you're piercing the veil,

208
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 because what if someone actually goes trying to find out a pomegranate

209
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and offers this person a giant rock?

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You might say, "That's kind of stupid, but so is the spell."

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And then you need what's known as "S-Bat" tools.

212
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Now, I have to look up what an "S-Bat" is.

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 It's where witches go to hang out.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's their coven meeting place, whatever.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You know, make--it's a made-up thing.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's a made-up thing.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So anyways, you go--so again, now the author goes,

218
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 "So what you do is you take all your supplies and you go to your "S-Bat."

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 But if you can't go there, go to your altar.

220
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But if you can't go there, do it by a window facing the moon.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And if you can--and I'm thinking, "Okay, here's the--this is, again, my problem."

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And I didn't get to this first time.

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 This is my problem with magic.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Science is fairly precise.

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Science doesn't go--if you want to look at amoeba, use a microscope.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But if you don't have a microscope, you know, just--just stare at a--at a--

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Petri dish and imagine there's something in there.

228
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And if there's no Petri dish there, then just look at the moon and imagine--

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It's very, very precise steps.

230
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Magic is always like, "Yeah, if you can't go through the trouble of walking to your--your spot where all your witch friends hang out, don't do the spell."

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 If you--it's so ridiculous how loosey-goosey magic is, especially--and again, that's my thing, especially wick and magic.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 When you talk about the cabala stuff, it's very ritualistic.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Like, you do it this way, or a demon's gonna--a demon's gonna get you.

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 If you mess up on this circle of protection, you're boned.

235
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 You might as well have your will written.

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 This one's like, "Ah, do it somewhere. Eat a salad or don't."

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 It doesn't matter because it doesn't work.

238
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But let's assume that it does work for a second.

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Let's assume it does work for a second.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So these are the steps.

241
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So the first thing you have to do is you clean and consecrate the brand new roll of toilet paper.

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Now, just to let you know, cleaning and consecrating things, 90% of the options they give us involve flame or water.

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Sprinkling water on it, running a candle around it, burning incense around.

244
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Toilet paper.

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 One of the most flammable things--it's basically the most fragile thing in your house is toilet paper.

246
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So anyways, you consecrate this toilet paper roll.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And then you focus on wanting to lose weight, which I agree with that step.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 You could just have visualization.

249
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Then you invoke the goddess Venus.

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 One of the main goddesses of the pantheon or partheon.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I couldn't figure that out in an earlier episode either, but one of the--you're going after one of the biggies.

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 You're not going after some no-name god.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I'm sure she's awfully busy.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But anyways, you're trying to call Venus to lose weight.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And at that point, she comes down--or maybe she doesn't. I don't know. It's all in your head anyways.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 But you tell Venus you want to lose weight.

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And at that point, you visualize yourself as the thinner you.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And when I got to that step, I go, "That is--that's it. That's perfect."

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Visualization is a huge part of working "magic" in your life.

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 You visualize--and all bodybuilders and all people who are weight loss experts will talk about you have to visualize yourself in your new body.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It is 100% a legitimate step when you are working out.

262
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So I was like, "Oh, they're on to something. They're just going to say, 'Visualize each day that you're healthier.'"

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I was like, "Oh, no, no, no. That might work."

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Then you hold the toilet paper--then it gets ridiculous again.

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 You hold the toilet paper and you charge it with your intent to lose weight.

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 You charge this toilet paper to lose 10--you're like, "Ugh. Yes, toilet paper. Venus, give me the strength to lose weight.

267
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Please, please."

268
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And you don't know whether or not the spell works. This is a very long-term spell.

269
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And then you give Venus the pomegranate or the lime. Whatever. Yeah, the lime. You give her the lime.

270
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 So which I am--because there's--Venus isn't there. What do you do? Just roll it on the ground.

271
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 You just set it down and walk away.

272
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And then for the next five days, as you're looking out your window in your backyard, you just see this lime slowly molting.

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's obviously Venus in a ticket. It's sitting in your backyard.

274
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Slime is sitting on the ground. Anyways, you roll it on the ground or whatever.

275
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You give it--offered up as--I don't get--okay, but anyways, we're getting stuck on that weird detail.

276
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Now here's the magic. That was just the setup. Here's the magic.

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 You take the roll of toilet paper. And this is--I couldn't believe that this is how the spell ended.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So let me read--before I go into this, let me read you this section.

279
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Because I was like, again, I have no idea. Once I realized why she was saying this, I again laughed out loud.

280
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Here's what she says.

281
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 "This toilet paper's purpose is going to be different from any other roll's purpose.

282
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So make sure you put it in a safe place."

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I was like, "What? What? Why?"

284
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 "Stash it in a bag under the counter, in a cosmetic case, or somewhere no one else will get to it."

285
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 "If you live with people and don't want to risk someone grabbing it, put it away in a bedroom drawer or closet."

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I'm thinking, "What? Why? Why do we have that warning?"

287
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So this is what you've done. You've invoked the goddess Venus. You've rolled the lime on the ground.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is what you do. You take that roll of toilet paper and on one square sheet of it, you write "1 pound."

289
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And then you tear that piece of toilet paper off and you visualize yourself losing that pound, which--visualization is a good thing.

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You visualize yourself losing that one pound.

291
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And then you throw it in the toilet and you flush it down.

292
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And then, after a couple of days, you visualize for the next few days you losing that pound.

293
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And then after a couple of days, after you've lost that pound, you take another sheet of paper, you write another sheet of toilet paper, you write "1 pound."

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And you take it off and you throw it and then you visualize.

295
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 So, first off, don't do the spell if you're in Britain, because basically you're going to become poor.

296
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 You're not going to be able to tell the difference between a pound of your weight.

297
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I guess you'd write "kilogram." Or would you just put "gram"? Do you? I never mind.

298
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I don't even want to get into the UK's measurement systems. Maybe you can do it in Britain.

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But anyway, so here's the thing. So you're writing down "1 pound" on this and you're flushing down toilet.

300
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Now, remember, you have invoked one of the ancient gods, one of the ancient Roman gods that were used to control the world, to charge this toilet paper with your essence.

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Your body weight, in a sense.

302
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 You have now created the most--you've basically created a voodoo doll of yourself.

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You've basically created a cursed item of yourself that, if it is destroyed in any way, represents your physical body.

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Now, you could say, "Well, Jason, you didn't write "1 pound" on it. It doesn't matter."

305
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I'll argue that that doesn't matter, because you've charged that with your weight problem.

306
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You've charged the toilet paper roll with your physical body.

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So, if someone does find it and just starts using it, you'll lose 30 pounds in a day.

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And actually, what's to stop someone from just writing 5 pounds on each sheet and throwing it away?

309
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And actually, a toilet paper roll has 500 sheets in it.

310
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So, who is this spell made for? Why not a notebook?

311
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Like an 80-page notebook. Why toilet paper?

312
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Toilet paper is the most fragile, like I said earlier.

313
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Toilet paper is the most fragile item in your household.

314
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And you have now linked that item to your physical body.

315
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 It makes sense now why you would not want anyone to use it.

316
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 You don't want to wake up one day and you have like, "Why am I all... What do I have poop all over my back?"

317
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 You don't want the cat to get a hold of it, because you'll get shredded.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You don't want it to... Imagine that.

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Imagine if this spell worked.

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And you've now created this toilet paper roll.

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You lose the 20 pounds you wanted to, so you could fit into your bridesmaid's dress, whatever.

322
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 You now have a toilet paper roll that has your essence on it that you can never get rid of.

323
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 That sounds like a cursed item to me, if anything.

324
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 If anything happens to that toilet roll, anything at all.

325
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 You move away and the new owner comes in, throws in the garbage.

326
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Next thing you know, you wake up, you feel like you're being crushed in a compactor.

327
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Or that a rat is clawing at your guts. It is you!

328
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 The most flimsy item possible.

329
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 You're creating a voodoo doll. For what? To lose weight.

330
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Absolutely bizarre.

331
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I would be terrified if I thought that this stuff worked, if someone was giving out advice like this.

332
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Why not turn yourself in? Why not say go buy a block of wood and every time you scrape off a splinter that you lose weight?

333
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Even that's bad!

334
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Because then for the rest of your life you go to haul around a block of wood.

335
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 You're basically the log lady at that point. Maybe that's your backstory.

336
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Let me just say this.

337
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I've realized that pretty much this entire episode is now me talking about overweight Wiccans and toilet paper.

338
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So we'll do the little South African monster man tomorrow.

339
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I did not plan for this episode to go this long.

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 But let me say this.

341
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 This is kind of how it... I don't want to go... This episode has already gone so long.

342
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Just the overweight stuff.

343
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 This was my... I don't know if I've ever told you guys this before.

344
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So I was very chubby growing up as a little boy.

345
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And then when I hit 17, I was like, "I'm done."

346
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I'm absolutely done being overweight.

347
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I was... I had an eating problem.

348
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's like by the time I got...

349
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 My graduation gown had to be custom made.

350
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I was so... I was 320 pounds.

351
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Which back in 1994 basically made me a circus freak.

352
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They had to custom make my graduation gown.

353
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Absolutely ridiculous.

354
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And I had an eating problem.

355
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I just ate.

356
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I ate all the time.

357
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And so I remember I would just... I had walked every...

358
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I had already been walking before that.

359
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But that's kind of how I unwound.

360
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But I just started over walking.

361
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And one day I...

362
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You know, oddly enough, not a lot of people made fun of my weight.

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But I knew that there was something unhealthy about me.

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And I remember one day...

365
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It's like one or two in the morning I was out walking in circles.

366
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Not like little circles, but I was walking on the block over and over again.

367
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 This is down Sacramento.

368
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And I came in the home.

369
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It's maybe like two in the morning.

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And I went and like was looking in the mirror and I was just sobbing.

371
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Sobbing. I was like 17 years old.

372
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 My mom heard me and she came out and she goes, "What's the matter?"

373
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And I was just like, "I'm just so tired of being fat.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I'm just so tired of being fat."

375
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And she goes, "Well, whatever you want to do, we'll do it.

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Whatever you want to do."

377
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And I decided what I wanted to do was the Slim Fast Diet.

378
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It seemed very convenient for me.

379
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I started doing the Slim Fast Diet.

380
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I started working out.

381
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And within a year I lost...

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I went from 320 to 220.

383
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So I lost 100 pounds.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 People thought I had cancer.

385
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I lost weight so quickly.

386
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You can see my rib cage.

387
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And then you go, "Well, Jason,

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 weren't you just saying you were 300 a couple years ago?

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So how did you go back from 220 to 350?

390
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You got bigger than before."

391
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 An interesting thing happened to me.

392
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I have a big mouth.

393
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And when I was 320 pounds in high school,

394
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I talked trash to anybody.

395
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Everybody.

396
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Talk trash.

397
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 It didn't matter.

398
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And I would talk trash and they would talk trash.

399
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I'm like, "What you want to do?

400
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 What do you want to do about it, man?"

401
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And they're like, "You know, whatever dude."

402
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I'd be like, "Yeah, that's what I thought."

403
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Now I did get in fights.

404
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Sometimes my mouth got the best of me.

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I did get in fights.

406
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But for the most part, it didn't.

407
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And then I dropped down to 220.

408
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And I remember one of the early warning signs was,

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I was hanging out.

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 A lot of girls were like, "Oh, you're really cute.

411
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Like, I didn't know you were so good looking.

412
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That type of stuff, that made me feel good."

413
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 But I remember I went over to my friend Mauricio's house

414
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and his sister was like,

415
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 "You used to be so intimidating.

416
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Like, you used to be scary.

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And now you're just a normal guy."

418
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And I was like, "That was kind of..."

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It was a weird comment.

420
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And I remember then, I went to one in college.

421
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I got my ass kicked a ton of times.

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Because I'd be mouthing off to someone

423
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and they're like, "What'd you say?"

424
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And I would repeat it.

425
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And then the next thing I know, I'd be boxing this dude.

426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And I'm thinking, "What is...

427
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Why is this guy fighting me?"

428
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Now, I won some as well.

429
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I didn't lose every single fight as a skinny guy.

430
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 But I realized something very quickly.

431
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That because I was the same size as the people I was mouthing off to,

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 they realized, "Oh, let's go."

433
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And I was like, "Uh-oh."

434
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So I lived in a bad neighborhood and I started...

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I mean, this is a weird thing.

436
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But I started putting the weight back on deliberately.

437
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And I got up to about 270.

438
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 So then I was just...

439
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And that's where I'm at right now.

440
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I was just a big dude.

441
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And I was able to start kind of holding my own again.

442
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 But then I just let it get out of control.

443
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I stayed around 272.84 probably about eight years.

444
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And then I got a job where I sat down and I was really depressed.

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And I didn't like the direction my life was going in.

446
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And I had my favorite foods and they were really fatty and full of carbohydrates.

447
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And I just ate and ate and ate and ate and ate.

448
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 And then I went from 280 to 350.

449
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And probably about five or six years.

450
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Maybe seven.

451
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 But the point is, it doesn't matter how long it took.

452
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 The point is I ballooned up to the level that you would see an animated character.

453
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 350 is huge.

454
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I was breaking furniture.

455
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And so I get it.

456
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I get the struggle with like body image and being upset and stuff like that.

457
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And that's why I'm not trying to be like, "Oh, fat wikens are so funny.

458
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Why are women fat?"

459
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 That's not what I'm going for.

460
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 That wasn't the whole...

461
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And I think it doesn't really do that in that segment either.

462
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But I think it's interesting because there is a version of Jason

463
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 that when he was that 17-year-old boy crying in the mirror throughout the multiverse,

464
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 throughout all the possibilities of my mom saying,

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 in that touching moment where a mother's looking at her son just sobbing because of how he is.

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 She loves her little boy, but he doesn't love himself.

467
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 In that moment, that moment stretched across the multiverse.

468
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And in some of them I said, "I want to do this.

469
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 I want to do this.

470
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I want to get surgery.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I want to start fasting.

472
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I want to do cardio.

473
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I want to just eat less.

474
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I just want to eat veggies.

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And across the multiverse, all these possibilities of little Jason--

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 not little, he's a huge guy who's 17, but Jason and his mom,

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 that one little element spread across a million possibilities

478
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and not a single one in that multiverse did Jason reach for a roll of toilet paper.

479
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Use some common sense, people.

480
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Toilet paper will not help you lose weight.

481
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It simply won't find what works for you, not toilet paper, not magic,

482
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 find what works for you guys and visualize.

483
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Because every day back then and now I visualize the body that I want.

484
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 That's what you got to do.

485
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 This was a weird episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

486
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I'm sorry, I originally had planned to do that one segment shorter

487
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and then do the Tokoloshi story.

488
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 We'll get to that tomorrow.

489
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So, apologize, this is the first episode you've ever listened to.

490
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 It's a weird one, but it's a Monday.

491
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
