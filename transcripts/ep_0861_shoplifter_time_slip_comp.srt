1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
 A small clay tablet found in the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon shows that ghosts

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,600
 and ghostbusters have been around for thousands of years.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,240
 Then we travel to the United Kingdom to meet a shoplifter being pursued down the street

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,180
 by a security guard.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,040
 When he turns and finds himself down a dead end, he thinks all hope is lost.

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,280
 But then the world got weird.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:42,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,140
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,160
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
 I hope you're not shoplifting as you're listening to this podcast.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
 But someone I know who never will shoplift from me coming into Dead Rabbit Command right

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,800
 now is one of our newest supporters of the show.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 Give it up for Rebel McA.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
 Wooo!

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,360
 I won't give a big round of applause as she's stealing all my stuff.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
 No, put that back.

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,680
 Rebel, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,000
 If you guys can't support this show financially, I totally get it.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,920
 Just help spread the word about the show.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,120
 That helps out so much.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 That really, really does.

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,120
 Rebel McA, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,680
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,320
 We're headed all the way out to the British Museum in Britain.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 The reason why we're over the British Museum right now is that we wanna take a look at

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
 a little tablet.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
 We could've shown up as tourists.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,360
 We could've just taken a taxi and shown up.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,080
 But instead we're gonna repel down.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,840
 We showed up at three in the morning.

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,680
 We're gonna repel down from the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
 Psssss.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
 Break a window.

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,400
 We traveled so quietly and then we made the loudest noise.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,520
 We're gonna take a close look at a small little tablet that is currently being held

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,400
 in the British Museum.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,040
 So we're walking around around tippy toes.

41
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
 You dressed in all black, right?

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,360
 You have a ski mask when you listen to this podcast normally, right?

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,800
 We're sneaking around in our sneakers in the British Museum and we come across this little

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
 stone tablet.

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,680
 Now this stone tablet was found in the ancient ruins of the city of Babylon.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,400
 You had these guys with toothbrushes dusting off dirt.

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,640
 They're like, "Go away dirt.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,160
 We don't want you anymore."

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
 And then they see like a part of a piece of clay and they're like, "That's what we're

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 here for."

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,760
 So they keep swiping away the dirt and then they find this little clay tablet and there's

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
 nothing on it.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,600
 They're like, "Oh, they just throw it away.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 It breaks."

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,960
 No, if you look at this tablet, it's about the size of the palm of your hand.

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,120
 There's nothing on it.

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,440
 But this is like some straight up Indiana Jones stuff and I don't know if it was intended

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,720
 to be this way or just thousands of years have gone by and this thing's eroded away.

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,240
 If you look at this little tablet directly under the light, like, you know, remember

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,240
 Indiana Jones had all those mirrors set up so we could see an object?

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,960
 You're like, "No, Jason, this is just someone who needs light to see something.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
 This isn't super magical.

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
 Everything you need light to see."

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,960
 If you look at this thing directly underneath the light, you see a picture of a woman, like

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,640
 a little hieroglyphic woman, like doing the little Egyptian stance thingy and then there's

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,480
 a man with his wrists bound following her.

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,880
 Now we would just think that was some kinky Babylon sex thing, right?

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,840
 No, you're wrong, you pervert.

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
 Why do you even think that?

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,840
 What this is, is this is from the year 1500 BC and this is an exorcism guide.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,200
 What they figured out was that this, there's some writing on it too, wasn't just the two

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
 pictures, right?

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,760
 Because otherwise, these archeologists are really bad at their job.

74
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,080
 They're like, "Oh, that's obviously a ghost."

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,760
 There's writing on it and it tells you how to get rid of a ghost out of a house.

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,480
 This is one of the oldest pieces of evidence we have of people believing in ghosts.

77
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,440
 And I talked about recently on an episode, we were talking about our ghost eventually

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
 going to disappear.

79
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,640
 And while I was doing that, I was looking at what are the earliest origins of the

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
 ghost.

81
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,200
 And really, and like I said on the episode, every culture, every single culture on planet

82
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,120
 earth has some variation of a ghost.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 And this is one of them.

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,400
 In the ancient city of Babylon, ghosts were considered such a problem that you needed

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
 to have exorcists.

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080
 Now this was actually, they said like, this would have belonged in someone's library

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,760
 because they didn't have books back then, they didn't have pages.

88
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,600
 Your library would just be a bunch of pieces of clay, I guess.

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,400
 So you'd like walk in, you're like eating dinner, you're like, "Oh no, man."

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,040
 You put my dinner on that, that was the history of our entire world.

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,560
 You had a bunch of clay tablets, so you would go and you'd pull out the clay tablet you

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
 wanted to read that day.

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
 I can't imagine there was a ton of information on it.

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,920
 It's like the size of the palm of your hand.

95
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,480
 But you pull it out of your library or they stacked up like dinner plates or whatever and

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,960
 you just read it and they said, "This one would have been in like a really like wealthy

97
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,680
 person's library or personally belonged to an exorcist."

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,120
 Because this was not just a common thing, it wasn't like a cooking recipe or something

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 like that.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
 It was how to send the souls of the damned back to hell.

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,480
 So we know what the spell is.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,080
 They've actually translated this and this was the first and I might argue most authentic

103
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
 way to get rid of a ghost because it was the first, right?

104
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,200
 You figure over time people are kind of like adding like their own little fan service to

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
 it and they're kind of adding like different ways to get rid of ghosts.

106
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
 You figure if you want to go back to the very first time someone had to get rid of a ghost.

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
 That probably worked, right?

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,880
 So anyways, we have this and this is how you do it.

109
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,680
 First off, you get two little figurines.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,800
 You get a male figurine and a female figurine.

111
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,880
 Then you get two big old mugs of beer, right?

112
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
 Root beer maybe if you're sober.

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 Actually, I probably want to mess with this spell, right?

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,800
 You're like, "Oh, I don't think it matters if it's beer or if it's orange Julius.

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,200
 Probably stick to the beer if that's what the spell calls for."

116
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,800
 And you wait until sunrise.

117
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,280
 I don't think you're allowed to drink the beer.

118
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,800
 The beer was just on the exercise when he got bored.

119
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,400
 He's like, "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look."

120
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
 Okay, now it's time.

121
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
 It had no ritual application.

122
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,640
 You have two figurines, a male and a female.

123
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:34,160
 You have two mugs of beer and then it mentions a ritual to summon Shemosh, who is the Mesopotamian

124
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,400
 God who led people into the underworld.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,520
 It doesn't tell us the actual ritual.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,800
 It may be on there in the British Museum didn't want to release the entire ritual because

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
 they thought people would be talking about it in haunted closets and causing the end

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
 of the world.

129
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,480
 It could be that the ritual was so common or would have been common to the person who

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,880
 read the tablet because, again, it's the size of the palm of your hand.

131
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 Like it may be like, it may be like, go back to the library and check out this book for

132
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:09,600
 the actual saying, but you say this ritual to the Mesopotamian God Shemosh and the soul

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 that is plaguing you will enter one of the figures.

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,440
 And at that point, it doesn't really say what you do with a figure.

135
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,080
 I don't know if you treat them to a nice bath and a mug of beer.

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,720
 It actually never mentions the beer again, as far as I can tell, or at least the articles

137
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 I read.

138
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,000
 But now you have this ghost trapped in this little figurine and they're saying the picture

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,080
 on the tablet, it seems like it was a male ghost that was harassing people in this house

140
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,560
 and it was following like it used the woman as bait.

141
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
 And I think that's why they have the two figurines.

142
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
 So it's like, ooh, it's like a boxed bunny cartoon.

143
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,640
 You have like a really sexy, carved out woman with like big hips and big boobs and you're

144
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,120
 like, look at me, don't you want me to be your girlfriend?

145
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,080
 And the ghost is like, hubba hubba hubba.

146
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,960
 And he goes into the little male clay figure and then he's trapped.

147
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,920
 I don't know if that's the exact spell, but it's something like that.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,480
 He said the woman was actually putting him in bondage and taking him out of the house

149
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,080
 in some sort of ritualistic way.

150
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,880
 Remember interesting, the very first exorcism spell we can look at, like this is the way

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,160
 to get rid of it.

152
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,040
 You got a ghost walking around your house, but there's one final line of text which shows

153
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:32,800
 that even back 3500 years ago, people loved to scare people.

154
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 Now this is really interesting.

155
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,760
 You're reading this tablet, it's late at night, you have your candle because it's all you

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
 have.

157
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,960
 Kids are gathered around and it's like a spooky Stephen King novel in the palm of your

158
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
 hand.

159
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,920
 The very last line of this tablet, it's talking about taking a ghost and trapping him in a

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,200
 figurine and this is the way to get rid of ghosts.

161
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:59,040
 The very last line is, don't look behind you.

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,360
 Then you're like, you're like super scared, you don't want to look behind you and you're

163
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,560
 kind of like flipping the tablet over, why aren't I supposed to look behind me, like

164
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
 what's going on?

165
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,160
 And they don't know who that is addressing.

166
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,960
 They don't know if that is addressing the exorcist.

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,800
 They don't know if that's addressing the person who's been plagued by the ghost and they're

168
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,960
 telling them not to look behind them.

169
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:30,280
 They don't know, it literally just in saying, do not look behind you.

170
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
 That's creepy.

171
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,960
 That is a creepy way to end a spell or end some sort of exorcism ritual, right?

172
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
 Because you think, what?

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,520
 I'm already dealing with a lost soul, a human being who's died and trapped on earth and

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,680
 I'm sending him to the afterlife.

175
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,480
 That's creepy enough and I'm looking at that.

176
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,560
 What's behind me?

177
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
 What am I being?

178
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
 You have such a little room to talk about things on this little clay tablet.

179
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
 Most of it's these pictures.

180
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,440
 Why shouldn't I look behind me?

181
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 That's creepy.

182
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,040
 What could possibly be standing behind the exorcist?

183
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 Spooky.

184
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 Spooky stuff.

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,120
 I don't know if anyone's tried this ritual.

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,960
 I mean, obviously people probably tried this ritual back in ancient Babylon.

187
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,520
 But I wonder if anyone has tried this ritual since then.

188
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,200
 I wonder if all the Akeads at the British Museum, they do have their Halloween parties

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,920
 and they're like, come on, come on Clay.

190
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,320
 That's what their names are, archeologists.

191
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,400
 And their parents didn't really have good name making skills.

192
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,720
 They're all hanging out at the museum and for Halloween they perform these rituals.

193
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,480
 And then like, dolly behind you dude.

194
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,760
 And then like the, some one of the other guys is dressed up in a sheet.

195
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,240
 He's dressed up as a mummy.

196
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
 He totally unwrapped King Tut.

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,440
 He's walking around in these 4,000 year old bandages.

198
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
 Look at me, I'm King Tut.

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
 Everyone bow before me.

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,160
 It's like super stinky.

201
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,440
 Super stinky costume.

202
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
 So who knows?

203
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,760
 I doubt they do that.

204
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,480
 I doubt they do that.

205
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,680
 I wonder if anyone has tried performing this 3,500 year old exorcism.

206
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
 What would happen?

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
 Would it be effective?

208
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,600
 And what's standing behind you while you are doing it?

209
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 Rebel McKay, let's go ahead and tashi those keys to the world famous Carpentercopter.

210
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,720
 We are leaving behind the British Museum.

211
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,400
 We are headed all the way out to Liverpool.

212
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,680
 So it's just kind of in the same area.

213
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,160
 It's not a globe trotting adventure this episode.

214
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
 But here are the keys.

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,480
 Fire that bad boy up.

216
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
 Leave behind this British Museum.

217
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
 The helicopter is in it.

218
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 It's destroying all of their mummies, their precious mummies.

219
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 Get us out of here.

220
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,200
 We're headed to Liverpool.

221
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,160
 Leaving behind a bunch of chopped up remains of ancient Egyptian rulers.

222
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,880
 We are now walking down the streets of Liverpool.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
 Specifically we're on Hanover Street.

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 And the year is 2006.

225
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
 Oi, oi, come back kid, come back.

226
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,640
 A security guard says as he's running out of a store.

227
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,400
 And he's chasing a young man named Sean Davis.

228
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,520
 Oh blokes, I'm gonna get caught, I'm gonna get caught.

229
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
 Sean says.

230
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,760
 Sean's a 19 year old thief.

231
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,880
 This is how he makes his money.

232
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
 He goes in.

233
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 He takes stuff.

234
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
 I'm not chasing, I know what a thief is.

235
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,040
 I know what a thief is.

236
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,120
 But he is in particular a shoplifter.

237
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,760
 There's different kinds of thieves.

238
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,520
 There's the cool thieves that break into banks and they're like, give me all your money,

239
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,240
 I'm gonna blow you away.

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,960
 And then there's the clever thieves that bring the stethoscopes.

241
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,800
 They're just called doctors, they rip you off.

242
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,600
 They're like, I saved your life, that'll be $100,000 please.

243
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,640
 No, you know the guys who are listening to safes and stuff like that?

244
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,040
 Oh I got it, I got it.

245
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,520
 All the money.

246
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,640
 And then there's the thieves who like breaking your house because they need crack.

247
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,040
 If you have all the crack, you're the crack dealer in your neighborhood and they're like

248
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 jackpot.

249
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,680
 And then you've got lowlifes.

250
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,560
 The shoplifters actually, okay I think the crack thieves are the worst, but shoplifters

251
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,520
 are so, they're just like the worst, right?

252
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,160
 I've worked retail my entire life.

253
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
 Shoplifters are like, oh man.

254
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,040
 But anyway, so this is what Sean Davis is.

255
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,920
 So he's not a bank robber, he's not a safecracker, he might be a crack addict, I don't know about

256
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
 that.

257
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,600
 But he's like the lowest of the low, he's the worst thief.

258
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,080
 He's running out of a store carrying some stuff that he jacked and the security guard,

259
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,760
 oi, oi, oi, is following after Sean Davis.

260
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:40,640
 Now Sean Davis is running down Hanover Street and he turns on Brooks Alley.

261
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,200
 Now if you're familiar with Liverpool, some of you may be like one or two of you may be.

262
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,720
 You should know that Brooks Alley is actually a dead end.

263
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,000
 And so Sean Davis, oh man, they're gonna catch me mate.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,160
 He knows that the jig is up.

265
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,600
 So he turns around and he waits for the security guard to come around the corner and give him

266
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,040
 a good pummeling with his baton and then call the police.

267
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,840
 The guard was right behind him a couple seconds pass and then a couple more pass and Sean

268
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,240
 just kinda catches breath and more seconds pass and nothing is happening.

269
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,120
 And then Sean all of a sudden starts to feel a pressure against his chest.

270
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
 And he says, "I wasn't scared."

271
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,680
 I wasn't worried I was having a heart attack or anything like that.

272
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
 He goes, "It wasn't coming from inside."

273
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,840
 He goes, "I could feel pressure pushing against my chest from the outside."

274
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,080
 And I'm standing there and I could tell the sensation was weird.

275
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,200
 I didn't know exactly what it was but I'm still waiting for the security guard to come

276
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,960
 around this corner.

277
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:53,680
 And at this point, a minute or two has passed and Sean knows full well that unless the security

278
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,160
 guard had a heart attack, he should be coming around this corner anytime.

279
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,040
 So Sean after a couple of minutes starts to leave Brooks Alley.

280
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:20,560
 And when he reaches where Brooks Alley opens up into Hanover Street, the street has changed.

281
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,160
 He's seen all of this at once but he can't really make sense of the connections of things.

282
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,400
 First off, he sees the cars that are driving by seem much more old fashioned than the year

283
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
 2006.

284
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,760
 And then maybe there's a collectible car convention in town.

285
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,360
 He starts to notice that the people walking down the street are also dressed in fashion

286
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
 that is not of the year 2006.

287
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,160
 Maybe there is a retro convention in town.

288
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,560
 Then he realizes there's no traffic lights down Hanover Street.

289
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,160
 And he goes, "Maybe there is a traffic light not having convention in town."

290
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,440
 And they wanted to be part of it.

291
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,520
 They chopped down all their traffic lights.

292
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:11,240
 He realizes what it looks like in the 1960s.

293
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,360
 I don't know if there were specifically wearing the bell bottoms and the groovy hair and all

294
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,520
 the cars were VW bugs, but he put enough clues together that this did not look like 2006

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
 anymore.

296
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:31,280
 But he is from 2006 so he immediately pulls out his cell phone and he notices that while

297
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,360
 his cell phone has power, he can't make a call.

298
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,440
 The cell phone is offline.

299
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,680
 So this young man is walking down the street with his cell phone and he is definitely a

300
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,160
 man out of time.

301
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,280
 He realizes that he is 40 years in the past.

302
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,480
 And when this is going on you would not be able to make sense of it.

303
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,520
 You would assume that that security guard is beating you so badly you're in a coma.

304
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,800
 I think that would be your first assumption that you have some sort of brain damage, that

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,160
 you've gone crazy.

306
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,560
 If you find yourself living 40 years in the past walking around seeing these sites and

307
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,680
 hearing these older automobiles and figuring out how in the world they're able to drive

308
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,320
 without traffic lights everywhere.

309
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,920
 And he's looking at his cell phone and he can't get it to work and he's walking down

310
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,440
 the street and he can't figure out what's going on.

311
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,880
 But he does know this.

312
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
 This is not his place.

313
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,440
 This is not his time.

314
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,640
 He wants to go back to the year 2006.

315
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:45,200
 And he's walking down the street and he actually gets to a building, a jewelry store.

316
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
 One of the many words that I don't know how to pronounce.

317
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,400
 It was H. Samuel's jewelry store and while he's there he actually pulls his cell phone

318
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
 out again to test it again.

319
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
 He says, "Come on, work, work."

320
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,960
 And when he pulled it out of his pocket, it's working.

321
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:14,080
 And he looks up from his phone and he looks down the street and it's the year 2006.

322
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
 It looks in front of him.

323
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,160
 It is the year 2006.

324
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,760
 He sees the newer cars, the newer clothes.

325
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,520
 But he turns and he looks down the path he had been walking.

326
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,640
 He looks to where he had been.

327
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:37,080
 And when he turns and looks back to where he had been, the year is 1967.

328
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:46,800
 He clearly sees the older automobiles, the old clothing behind him.

329
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:54,360
 The path he took down Hanover Street is still in the year 1967 and then slowly it begins

330
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
 to fade.

331
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:07,840
 An inch by inch foot by foot block by block begins to be replaced with the year 2006.

332
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
 Fascinating story.

333
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,640
 One, he has a cell phone.

334
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,160
 He actually took a cell phone, a modern piece of technology, back to the past.

335
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 This is interesting.

336
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,120
 You know, we have a new type.

337
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,840
 There's this big story in Argentina about this woman who claims that she got abducted

338
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,120
 by aliens and they dropped her off like 40 miles away, which there's a lot of stories

339
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
 like that.

340
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,160
 We're going to be coming up to one later, I think this week.

341
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,640
 The aliens are really bad about putting you back where they found you.

342
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,960
 It's a really common problem.

343
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,080
 And one of the things that the UFO researchers and the abductee themselves are talking about

344
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,760
 is they want the cell phone data because she had a cell phone in her pocket, which is a

345
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,040
 tracking device in your pocket.

346
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:01,280
 So Google Maps should show her going from point A to point B in too short of a time.

347
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,040
 Now apparently like they have not been able to get access to that information or if they

348
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,000
 just use the consumer side of Google Maps or Google tracking or whatever it is, it's

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,720
 not giving them what they think it should.

350
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,000
 So there's actually been a push towards that and we're reaching a point where we all have

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,520
 tracking devices on us at all times.

352
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,560
 So these stories where aliens abduct people and then drop them off in another location,

353
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,760
 they get far more tricky.

354
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
 And that's the same thing with this young man.

355
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,280
 He has a cell phone in him and what he is going through is a time slip.

356
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,400
 And he knows that because he walked up to a newsstand and looked at the date on the newspaper

357
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,440
 and he was in the year 1967, specifically May 18, 1967.

358
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,160
 This is absolutely fascinating.

359
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:59,040
 The time slip story we covered last week, the only piece of modern technology they had

360
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,920
 on them was their automobile.

361
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,160
 But now you could whip your phone out.

362
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,280
 Now the phone wouldn't work in the past, right?

363
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,000
 That is a detail that would make sense.

364
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,320
 There's no cell phone towers to mount it off of.

365
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,120
 The phone itself, it has power.

366
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,920
 It would show his date in 2006.

367
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,080
 But the newspaper and everything else was showing he was there on May 18, 1967.

368
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,880
 The other interesting part of it is that visual trick, right?

369
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,120
 Where he's looking back and he's watching time fade back.

370
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,840
 You could argue again that he was having some sort of brain aneurysm or some sort of

371
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 vision fit.

372
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,240
 Like something's not working right with his vision.

373
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,520
 The idea of it slowly, like looking back and still seeing the vibrant 1967 world and then

374
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,280
 watching it slowly fade until it became his modern day world.

375
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
 That's an interesting visual glitch.

376
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,000
 I remember once I was driving down the road and I realized the world was upside down,

377
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 but it was only in front of me.

378
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,640
 I was still right side up.

379
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,920
 But everything in front of me was upside down.

380
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,480
 I think I've told this story before.

381
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:13,520
 The road that I was driving on was beneath me, but the road ahead of me was in the sky.

382
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,160
 And all the cars were driving in the sky.

383
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,080
 It was like if you took the world and then flipped it over and then lifted it up about

384
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,960
 30 feet.

385
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,320
 I had been driving like that for a while.

386
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,640
 And once I, I don't know who knows how long, but I remember going, wait a second, the world

387
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,160
 shouldn't be upside down.

388
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,480
 And right when I thought that it was like someone hit a swivel and the world actually

389
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,240
 went teeter totter and then spun back into place.

390
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,320
 So now in all the cars I saw in the sky upside down were actually relative, were spaced perfectly

391
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 as I was driving.

392
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,000
 Like when the world went teeter totter and then flipped back over like someone hit a

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,040
 mechanical switch and just went, and when it folded back into place again, it had a

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 little bounce.

395
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,960
 There was a real physical presence to it.

396
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,120
 It was, that was, it was so interesting because if you do hits, like if you have a teeter

397
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
 totter and you hit it, it will wobble a bit.

398
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
 Each time it moves, it'll wobble a bit.

399
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,200
 So it wasn't that I just saw the world upside down and then it was bam, back to being normal.

400
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,360
 It had a weight to it.

401
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,080
 It had a physics as it was spinning.

402
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,960
 When it began spinning and when it stopped spinning, it had a bit of a wobble.

403
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,840
 I always figured, you're like, please go to a brain doctor.

404
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,080
 That's totally abnormal.

405
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,520
 I always figured, you know, we see things upside down or eyes actually perceive everything

406
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,200
 upside down or brain fixes it.

407
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,280
 So we see it right side up.

408
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,680
 I was thinking I was so relaxed in that moment or so lost in thought.

409
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,680
 What I was saying is what the world would actually look like if our brain wasn't automatically

410
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
 correcting it.

411
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,440
 That's what I always felt was going on.

412
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,240
 But yeah, so when there is a weight to things, if he looked down the street, it still would

413
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,720
 have been an interesting story if he looked down the street and it was just 2006.

414
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,840
 But the idea that it was slowly correcting itself, like the place he had been was still

415
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:15,360
 1967, but now that he was in the year 2006, it was slowly correcting itself, fading away.

416
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 Fascinating.

417
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,200
 But here's the thing with this story, right?

418
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
 It's a time slip story.

419
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,520
 I love time slip stories.

420
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,120
 We just covered one last week and I don't want to go too heavy on them.

421
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
 But this one has some more interesting stuff to it.

422
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,560
 It was reported in a website that we go to all the time on this show.

423
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
 It's a great website.

424
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
 I recommend it to people.

425
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
 It's called Anom Alien.

426
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,880
 I know you guys aren't going to be able to spell that.

427
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
 It's in the show notes.

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 You can find the link in the show notes.

429
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,040
 I got all my information for this story from that website.

430
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,320
 And that's part of the problem.

431
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,200
 There was no one else talking about this story.

432
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
 No one.

433
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,960
 Anom Alien website does state that there was a local newspaper, which could be like a very

434
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,600
 small newspaper somewhere in Breton because they have city papers and sometimes they even

435
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,920
 have papers smaller than that, like neighborhood papers.

436
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,000
 They said that paper, a very local paper, talked to Sean Davies about this story.

437
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,160
 They wanted to know about this story and apparently according to Anom Alien, which they didn't

438
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
 link to the story, I wasn't able to find it, but they said they actually were able to verify

439
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,480
 some of the stuff he talked about was around back then.

440
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,080
 I guess they didn't have traffic lights.

441
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,040
 I guess some of the stores that he mentioned walking by existed back in the year 1967.

442
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,960
 And according to Anom Alien, this newspaper contacted the security guard and he attested,

443
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,200
 "Oh yeah, mate.

444
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
 I do remember that.

445
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,280
 I remember that like it was the year 2006."

446
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,800
 He goes, "I was chasing this guy out of the store and I was right behind him.

447
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,600
 There was just a couple yards behind him and he turned down Brooks Alley and when I got

448
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,320
 to the alley he was gone and I could not figure that out because that's a dead end."

449
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,520
 We all of this is resting on the word of Anom Alien, which is a really good website.

450
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,280
 I wasn't able to verify any of this stuff, but I wanted to wrap it up like this because

451
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,680
 I was able to find something.

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,440
 While I was looking up to see if I could find any other source on this story, I was typing

453
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,480
 in things like Sean Davies, Sean Davis, however you pronounce it, I've done it both ways,

454
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,720
 Sean Davies Hanover Street, Sean Davies Liverpool.

455
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,040
 I'm trying to look for any other mention of this, Sean Davies, Time Slip, all that stuff,

456
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,560
 right?

457
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,580
 Nothing was coming up except for this Anom Alien article, but I did find an interesting

458
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,880
 little note.

459
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,560
 In 2010, in the year 2010, there is a town called Dudley in the United Kingdom.

460
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,320
 It's about an hour and a half, an hour and 15 minutes around there from Liverpool.

461
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 There was a young artist living in Dudley and a local drug dealer stabbed him.

462
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 Stabbed him pretty violently.

463
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,080
 I don't know if there's a peaceful stabbing, they're like, "Oh, it's kind of like a hug,"

464
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,720
 except for the part where the blade went in between the ribs.

465
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,600
 He stabbed this artist and it actually severed some nerves and he now has a shaky hand.

466
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,280
 They say he has a very distinctive brush stroke because his hand shakes a little bit because

467
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,320
 he got stabbed.

468
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,440
 That artist's name is not Sean Davies, trick you.

469
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,200
 The stabber, the drug dealer who carries around the knife, which is about as best as a weapon

470
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,720
 as you can get in the United Kingdom.

471
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:45,360
 There was a drug dealer named Sean Davies who stabbed this guy in 2010 and was sent to

472
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
 prison for it.

473
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,200
 He did seven years in prison and he got released in the year 2017.

474
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,960
 Could that be the same Sean Davies?

475
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,680
 The timeline would kind of match.

476
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,800
 He was a thief in 2006.

477
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,840
 Maybe he worked his way up to being a drug dealer.

478
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,440
 He's like, "I finally stole enough stuff.

479
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,040
 I'd like one drug, please."

480
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,120
 And then the drug dealer shells in one drug and then he's like, "I'm going to break this

481
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,160
 into smaller drugs and sell those."

482
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,760
 And then he stepped up his game and became a drug dealer.

483
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
 It's quite possible.

484
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
 It's also possible.

485
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,360
 There's multiple people going by the name Sean Davies, right?

486
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,720
 That's definitely possible as well, but when I was looking at this, it probably was this

487
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,320
 guy, right?

488
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
 Shoplifter.

489
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
 Maybe it's a stretch.

490
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,480
 A shoplifter in Liverpool maybe becomes a drug dealer an hour or two away.

491
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,440
 There were a couple other people named Sean Davies in the UK, but they had like LinkedIn

492
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,760
 pages and stuff.

493
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,320
 They're like managers of firms and stuff like that.

494
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,960
 I was like, "I don't know.

495
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,000
 That is probably different to Sean Davies."

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
 But I thought this was really interesting.

497
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,040
 I think this is a great way to wrap this up.

498
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,720
 Whether you believe in the paranormal or not, we as Dead Rabbit Radio family love the paranormal.

499
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,080
 You may not believe in it, but we have an interest in the paranormal.

500
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,440
 I mean, that comes along with wanting to experience the paranormal, right?

501
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,840
 I've had a lot of really cool and a lot of scary stuff happen to me.

502
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,160
 I've never had a time slip.

503
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
 I figured that would be awesome.

504
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,200
 I would think that that could be life altering.

505
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,560
 And I think a lot of people would think the same thing would be age.

506
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,160
 I rank it up there almost with a life after death scenario.

507
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,720
 Like I've seen ghosts and demons and stuff like that.

508
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,440
 But to go back in time.

509
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,200
 Like I think that's everyone's dream.

510
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,680
 That's why we have things like a retro wave.

511
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
 That's why we get nostalgic.

512
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,560
 And if you could go back in time, you could relive those things.

513
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,760
 Time slip would be awesome.

514
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,880
 But the interesting thing is like I said, I've had a lot of paranormal encounters.

515
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,640
 I've had stuff that other people may like, "Whoa, dude, you saw a demonically possessed

516
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,960
 person and the world keeps spinning around and you're driving a motor vehicle?"

517
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,360
 That seems like that would be life changing.

518
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,200
 That seems like then you would totally believe in the paranormal and if demons exist then

519
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,080
 you must know that God and angels exist and life after death.

520
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
 I'm like, "Yeah."

521
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,520
 But it's not a time slip.

522
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,240
 I didn't get to go through a portal.

523
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,440
 Like it's not super life altering.

524
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,160
 And I think that's what the story, if this is the same Sean Davies, it shows that these

525
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:25,120
 events that we read about, that we discuss on this show, they're not to the people who

526
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,320
 go through them, life goes on.

527
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,000
 Like to us it's a really cool segment that we can talk about and analyze on the podcast,

528
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,280
 but to Sean Davies, in the real world, if this happened, he shoplifts, he runs down

529
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:48,000
 a street, he ends up in the year 1967, he wants to come back, he comes back, then what?

530
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,160
 Maybe, maybe.

531
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,320
 If it was a profound enough event he could have turned it into a career as an author.

532
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,600
 And even that, you know, doing the speaking circuit and stuff like that, even that you

533
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,120
 have to have the skills of public speaking and writing to begin with.

534
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,280
 And those aren't easy skills if you just don't have a knack for them.

535
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:15,520
 So you have this profound, you travel back in time and you're there for a while.

536
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,840
 And then you come back and you're still a thief, you're still a member of the lupin

537
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,320
 proletariat.

538
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,680
 You're the underclass, you're a shoplifter.

539
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,400
 So he continues that life, with now he has a really cool story to tell his buddies, right?

540
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:40,560
 But he's still a shoplifter, still a thief, still a criminal.

541
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,840
 He goes on with his life and eventually he ends up becoming a drug dealer and he stabs

542
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:54,840
 this young man and then does seven years in prison and just disappears into the British

543
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
 underworld.

544
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:06,000
 Or you got a LinkedIn page, but statistically speaking, right?

545
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,920
 Just because you have the profound event, just because you have proof that the paranormal

546
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,680
 exists on this scale, time travel exists, doesn't mean your life's going to change at all.

547
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,960
 May become an interesting anecdote.

548
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,160
 So it may not be that ultimate profound life change and experience when you find out that

549
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,440
 alternate universes exist, that there is life after death, that time travel is possible.

550
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,800
 These things are great stories to tell, but do they change your life?

551
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,600
 In Sean Davies' example, maybe not.

552
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,240
 Maybe he continued down that path that eventually led him to stabbing a man and doing seven

553
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,160
 years in prison.

554
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:01,800
 Maybe Sean Davies shouldn't have tried to outrun his trip to the past.

555
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:13,520
 Maybe Sean should have accepted this moment in time, accepted this gift from the universe,

556
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:24,080
 a fresh start, a new life, a chance to do things over again.

557
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:36,880
 Maybe our fear of the paranormal is actually a fear of change.

558
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,200
 So whether you are traveling down the street one day and you find yourself 20 years in

559
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:53,600
 the past, or you're abducted by a group of aliens, and sure it may involve some probing,

560
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,960
 but they're offering you a new life on a new world.

561
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,000
 Maybe think twice about trying to get back to your own time period, or think twice about

562
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,160
 getting that grey alien in a headlock while you kick another one in the kneecaps.

563
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:19,640
 Because while the unknown is scary, the universe may be doing you a favor.

564
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:47,680
 It may be offering you the gift of a fresh start in a new world.

565
00:34:47,680 --> 00:35:17,480
 Maybe your fear of the paranormal is actually a fear of change.

566
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:34,920
 Thank you.

567
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,500
 (upbeat music)
