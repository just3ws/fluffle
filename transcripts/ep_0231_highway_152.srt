1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 Straight from the conspiracy theory iceberg, we take a look at a man who would do anything

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
 to protect his family.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,960
 That man's name?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,920
 O.J. Simpson.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,200
 And then we end the week with a personal theory of mine.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,200
 We talk a lot about where ghosts come from, why they haunt particular locations and not

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
 others.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:32,160
 But there is one location that everyone uses that is most likely the most haunted place

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,200
 on the planet.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 And we'll take a look at those today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,840
 We're just going to go ahead and get started with this because we kind of got a lot of

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 stuff to cover.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,080
 Now a lot of listeners go, "Hey man, we want more conspiracy iceberg stuff."

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
 And I'm totally down to do more conspiracy iceberg stuff.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
 It does tend to take more research.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
 And there's so much of it.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 So if you guys have any particular recommendations of what you want to hear about on the conspiracy

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,880
 iceberg, just shoot me an email, leave a comment in the videos, things like that.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,920
 There's just a lot of stuff.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
 And so I kind of have to pick and choose.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,800
 And there's a lot of stuff I come across on the conspiracy theory iceberg that just isn't

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,240
 super intriguing once you really start looking at it.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,760
 And I'm like, I could, this would be like a five minute segment.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 But this story is one that people kind of laugh about.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,220
 You see it on the conspiracy iceberg.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,760
 You think it's one of those made up things.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,640
 There's actually quite a lot of evidence.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,600
 Well, I don't know if I want to use the word evidence, but alleged evidence to back this

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 up.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,720
 So I'm going to briefly cover this because I think a lot of people are familiar with

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 it.

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,640
 But back in, I don't remember the year, unfortunately, I think it was like 94.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,360
 I know his trial was a 95, but O.J. Simpson murdered, sorry, shouldn't have said that.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,800
 The police said that O.J. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
 So Nicole Brown was his wife.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
 And they were kind of on the outs.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,400
 It might have been his ex-wife at the time.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,720
 I'm not too, I lived through that whole time period.

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,980
 And I remember really not caring much about it back then.

44
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,120
 But you watch this guy, you watch this world-famous athlete/star of the naked gun movies, which

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
 the first two hold up really well.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,400
 He ends up getting charged with the murder of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,160
 A brutal, brutal slashing murder.

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,240
 And I remember at the time, it's like he just chopped him both up with a knife.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
 Assuming, well, the reason why I have to keep backtracking on that was he was acquitted

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
 of it.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
 He wasn't found not guilty.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,660
 He was just acquitted of the charges that he had killed those two people.

53
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,340
 And he had a great legal team and a lot of people thought he had something to do with

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,460
 it and he, as legally, they could never prove anything.

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,820
 So he walked on those charges.

56
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,380
 So everyone thought O.J. Simpson was going to be found guilty and he wasn't.

57
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,300
 And he says, "Now I'm off to find the real killers."

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,740
 And then he just played golf for pretty much the rest of his life until he ended up committing

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,320
 like strong armed robbery a couple years ago and he's in a Nevada prison.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,680
 But so if he was guilty of the murder, he did eventually end up paying for it because

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,600
 he ended up going to prison for trying to steal back memorabilia that someone had taken from

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 him.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,320
 All that being said, this next thing we're going to talk about on the conspiracy theory

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,520
 iceberg actually may paint O.J. Simpson in a new light and may actually paint him as

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,480
 world's best dad.

66
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
 Maybe.

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,680
 Let's take a look at this.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,820
 So there was a private investigator named Bill Deere.

69
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
 Bill Deere.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,460
 If he said both names together, he sounds like a character from The Hobbit.

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,340
 But Bill Deere was a private investigator and he started looking into the O.J. case and

72
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,940
 he said, "O.J. is innocent and I can prove it."

73
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,500
 So much so that he wrote a book called "O.J. is innocent and I can prove it."

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,020
 And in this book he lays out the facts that O.J. Simpson did not murder Nicole Brown and

75
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,260
 Ron Goldman.

76
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,520
 His son did.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,220
 Now everything I'm about to talk about is completely alleged.

78
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,920
 It's from Bill Deere's vault that he got underneath the minds of Moria.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
 He found this giant ancient text and he got all these details.

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,400
 So I'm not saying that Jason Simpson did these things, but he does.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 He's saying that.

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,040
 So on the conspiracy theory iceberg it's listed as "O.J.

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,000
's son is the real killer."

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,240
 So this is what Bill Deere just plotted out in his book.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
 Nonfiction book, by the way.

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,160
 Well, nonfiction according to him, people have disputed it.

87
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,020
 And he says he found evidence that Jason was diagnosed with IED, which if you're gonna

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,100
 have a mental disease, have one named after a bomb.

89
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,300
 That is at least that's pretty badass.

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,540
 But anyways, he has I- could you imagine going to people and be like, "Yeah, I'm having a

91
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
 terrible day.

92
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
 My IED is really flaring up."

93
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,380
 And people are like, "Uh."

94
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,900
 He's not allowed into home depots anymore.

95
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,580
 He's not allowed to buy nails.

96
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,100
 His name, it's not his name.

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,420
 His disease's name allegedly is IED and that's the last time I'm gonna say allegedly.

98
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,980
 I think you guys will get it.

99
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,800
 He's supposedly, I guess it's the same as allegedly.

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,200
 Anyways, Bill Deere says that Jason Simpson has IED, which is known as Intermented Explosive

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
 Disorder.

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 That's still pretty badass.

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,720
 It sounds like a horrible thing to suffer through, but it still sounds pretty cool.

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,920
 And it's something where you're, you have extreme outbursts of anger over little things.

105
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
 So you just freak out all the time.

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,600
 I'm sure you've known someone with IED.

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
 I definitely have.

108
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
 But around the time of the, this is all really bizarre.

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,500
 Now again, we're going to assume for the sake of this that Bill Deere's done his research

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,740
 and he's not just making stuff up.

111
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,300
 But Bill Deere said, "Around the time of the murder," and this actually would be easy

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
 to verify.

113
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,060
 No one's really disputed a lot of the details.

114
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,180
 They just dispute the motive.

115
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,220
 Around the time of the murders, Jason Simpson was on probation.

116
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,500
 "Probation for what?" you ask.

117
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,740
 He was probation for attacking a former employer with a knife.

118
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,540
 Now I guess I should have said this earlier, but Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman were stabbed

119
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
 to death.

120
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,040
 Actually that's kind of a misnomer.

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
 They were cut to ribbons.

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 Cut to ribbons.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,120
 Don't want to go into a lot of the grizzly details.

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,840
 Like, I mean, they weren't just poked a couple times with a knife and whoever did it ran

125
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
 away.

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
 They were, they were completely slashed up.

127
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,080
 This guy was on probation for attacking a former employer with a knife.

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,560
 Two months before the murders, he had violently assaulted his girlfriend.

129
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,840
 Just beat the crap out of her.

130
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,660
 And then on another occasion, he attacked a former girlfriend and cut her hair off using

131
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
 a knife.

132
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,820
 So Bill Deere is saying that Jason has this tendency to fly into a rage at a drop of a

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,900
 hat.

134
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,940
 That he has attacked people with knives in the very, very recent past around the time of

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
 the murders.

136
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,060
 I don't know about right now, but around the time of the murders he had attacked people

137
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,500
 with knives.

138
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,860
 He also found some of Jason, Jason Simpson's diaries.

139
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,220
 Now this is where I'm kind of like, how did you get these?

140
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,160
 But anyways, he found these diaries supposedly that belonged to Jason Simpson.

141
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,600
 And I'm gonna read this excerpts or these excerpts to you.

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,960
 They're pretty brief.

143
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,840
 And I want you to ask yourself, are these the signs of somebody who is suffering from

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
 IED?

145
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
 They could just blow up at a moment's notice?

146
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,840
 Or is this the lead singer of Papa Roach?

147
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,560
 This was in his diary.

148
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
 It's the year of the knife for me.

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,460
 I cut away my problems with a knife.

150
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,500
 That's one thing from it.

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,980
 Anybody touches my friends, I will kill them.

152
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,540
 It's kind of edgy, kind of edgy teenage.

153
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,100
 Cut my life into pieces.

154
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,580
 This is my last resort.

155
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,460
 That was a trick question.

156
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,100
 But then he also supposedly wrote, I'm also tired of being Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

157
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,600
 I mean, I'm sure you can find a lot of edgy people's diaries or writings and they'll have

158
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,920
 stuff in it like that.

159
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,560
 Or song lyrics for new metal bands.

160
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
 But we're seeing a pattern here.

161
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,900
 The knife attacks, the mental instability, these very edgy writings in this, I'm assuming

162
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,520
 spiral notebook with like the Stussy symbol drawn on the front eight times.

163
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,920
 Now let's look at some other brief pieces of evidence.

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,540
 One, they think if this is true, what set him off was that Nicole was supposed to come

165
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,300
 visit Jason's restaurant and at the last minute canceled it, which made him fly into a rage.

166
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,180
 People at work were like, oh my God, dude, settle down.

167
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,340
 He's like, give me a knife, give me a knife.

168
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,740
 They're like, dude, settle down.

169
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,060
 He's like, give me my notebook and he starts scribbling out lyrics.

170
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,220
 People said to the restaurant, it really upset him.

171
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,900
 And apparently his alibi was, well, I couldn't murder them.

172
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,500
 I was working at this restaurant.

173
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 So I wasn't anywhere near him.

174
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,680
 People at the restaurant said we closed early that night and his time card was simply hand

175
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,920
 written that night.

176
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,360
 It wasn't punched like they normally are in the machine.

177
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
 But the police never really formally questioned him.

178
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,280
 But as Bill Deere keeps going through this evidence, he says, listen, this is what we,

179
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,960
 these are the facts we know about the murder.

180
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,240
 Ron Goldman had fought for his life.

181
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,680
 The police said there was most likely like a 10 to 15 minute struggle between the killer

182
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,180
 and Ron Goldman.

183
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:24,420
 Ron Goldman had bruises on his body so deep, so big that they said it looks like someone

184
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,780
 punched him to the bone.

185
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,460
 When they checked OJ Simpson, he didn't have any like bad bruises.

186
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,220
 He didn't look like he had been in a boxing match.

187
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,100
 He had some cuts, some small like abrasions, but nothing would suggest that he went, he

188
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,380
 fought a man to the death for 10 to 15 minutes.

189
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,700
 Nothing would suggest that.

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,920
 Jason Simpson was a black belt in karate, so he could fight so, okay, actually before

191
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,680
 I go on to that, I've lost track of the amount of people who said that they are good at karate

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,600
 and gotten their butts handed to him.

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,360
 So I'm not saying just because you're good at karate means that you can definitely win

194
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
 a fight.

195
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,840
 However, for this instance, let's say that the karate black belt actually means that

196
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,480
 he could stand up and fight a man for 10 minutes.

197
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 But he has a knife.

198
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,400
 He's able to just kind of poke him, take blood out of him, weaken him, fight keeps going

199
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,860
 on, gets more violent, things like that.

200
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,660
 OJ Simpson did not look like he was in a fight for his life.

201
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,420
 Nobody ever checked the sun to see how bruised up he was.

202
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,500
 He's all busted up.

203
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,300
 He looks like Rocky at the end of the movie.

204
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,740
 He's like, "Ugh, I was just, uh, I stepped on a rake."

205
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,820
 So, but nobody questioned it.

206
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,500
 Nobody examined him to see if he had any of those things.

207
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,380
 Now the question is, there, and then the other people are saying, "Listen, Jason wasn't

208
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,820
 seeing anyone anywhere around the house that night.

209
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,640
 People thought they saw OJ Simpson walking in the bushes, like Bigfoot, skulking about.

210
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
 People said, "If this is, so this is what's interesting is all the pushback on this is,

211
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,800
 well, what about all the evidence of OJ Simpson?

212
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,640
 Why did he go running for his life?

213
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,480
 Why did he ride a suicide note?

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,560
 The bloody shoe prints match the type of shoes that OJ Simpson wears."

215
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,280
 All of these other details that came out in the trial, they're going, no one's saying,

216
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,840
 that's not true about, Jason didn't get arrested for attacking someone with a knife.

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,060
 Jason wasn't having been diagnosed with IED.

218
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,980
 They just say, "Well, no, no, look at all the evidence we have for OJ Simpson."

219
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,980
 The problem is, is that that evidence failed in court.

220
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,860
 So let me ask you this.

221
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,340
 How good of a father do you have to be to know that your son killed your ex-girlfriend

222
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,220
 and her new lover, and for you to say, "I'll cover it up for you?"

223
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,340
 And if they point the finger at me, I'll go to court.

224
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,600
 Not only will I do that, but I'll actually make sure they point the finger at me.

225
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,760
 I'll go on the run.

226
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
 I won't show up for questioning.

227
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
 I'll write a suicide letter.

228
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,600
 I'll give them all this stuff because I know 100% I did not kill them.

229
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,000
 I know 100% I have no DNA left there after a 15 minute knife fight with two people.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
 I know I left none of my own blood there.

231
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 I will cover it up.

232
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,600
 If you found out that your son had done something like that, or your kid or whatever, would you

233
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,500
 help cover it up because you would go into court thinking, "I didn't do it.

234
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,340
 I'm going to give the best lawyers I can, and at the end of the day, I didn't do it."

235
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,940
 There's nothing physically tying me to that scene other than the bloody shoe print and

236
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,460
 a glove, which they denied, which his team denied.

237
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,860
 That's not even his glove.

238
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,180
 If the glove won't fit, you must acquit, was Cochran's famous saying.

239
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,640
 The bloody glove that was on the ground.

240
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,560
 O.J. Simpson tried to put it on during trial.

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,320
 Now he did make a weird hand.

242
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,120
 It was going to be impossible for it to fit in trial.

243
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,440
 He could also just drink a bunch of water or had a bunch of eat a bunch of salt, get

244
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,320
 a bunch of sodium and just kind of swell up.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,480
 That also make it hard for it to fit.

246
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,240
 Or the glove wasn't his.

247
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,280
 Would you be able to take the blame for a crime that your son committed?

248
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,500
 Would you be willing to risk it all to cover up for his crime?

249
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,940
 It's an interesting question.

250
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,420
 And I think all of us just being reasonable adults that we are, you know when you go into

251
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,380
 trial even if you are 100% innocent, there is a chance you will be convicted.

252
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:27,420
 Which, if this theory is true, makes O.J. Simpson's actions even more selfless.

253
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,740
 He could have said, "I had nothing to do with this.

254
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,680
 There's no physical evidence connecting me to this whatsoever.

255
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,300
 But I've seen enough people throughout my life go to prison for crimes they did not

256
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
 commit.

257
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,200
 And I will take that chance for you, Jason.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,080
 I will take that chance."

259
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,800
 Would you be willing to do the same thing for one of your kids?

260
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 Interesting question.

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
 Interesting topic on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

262
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
 It's one of the ones that didn't pop out to me at first.

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,880
 And even when I was researching it and I was like, "Huh?"

264
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,300
 The more I thought about it, I thought, "That's an interesting angle.

265
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,180
 Not that the fact that someone came up with this theory, but would you be able to do the

266
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,020
 same thing that this theoretical O.J. Simpson did?

267
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,900
 And is it not just that he's back in prison?

268
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:20,740
 He was actually a good man who America hated, but his son never stopped loving him."

269
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,540
 Now let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

270
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,260
 Now, our next story, we're taking a little road trip.

271
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,400
 Everyone hop in.

272
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,720
 Everyone hop into the Jason Jalopy.

273
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 Glad it's back in operation because we're going to be driving around.

274
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,160
 We are going down America's highways.

275
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,760
 In fact, we are going down one highway in particular, Highway 152 in California.

276
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:52,000
 In Pacheco Pass in Central California, it runs Highway 152.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,120
 The road was initially set up during the Gold Rush, and now it's become one of the

278
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,300
 many roads that gets Californians, California owns, gets people from California to drive

279
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
 all around.

280
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
 It's a beautiful state.

281
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:11,740
 California has a lot of problems, but it is very visually stunning in a lot of places.

282
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,540
 I used to move up and down the state.

283
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,620
 First 35 years of my life was just moving from one end of the state to the other.

284
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,900
 And it is quite beautiful there.

285
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,860
 And Highway 152 is no exception.

286
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,560
 But the road is known for two things.

287
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,760
 It isn't a straight shot.

288
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,440
 So you'll have straight shots of it, but then the road will get narrower, and then it will

289
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,800
 expand back to where it should be.

290
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,480
 You'll have this long, open stretch of just straight road, and then it will start curving.

291
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
 So if you want to play Mario Kart, it's perfect.

292
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,920
 But if you're just trying to get around, it's not the most comfortable drive.

293
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
 So it's no one for that.

294
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,260
 But secondly, it is recognized by the CHP, the California Highway Patrol, the CHIPS,

295
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,620
 to be one of the most dangerous stretches of highway in the state.

296
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,700
 They are constantly getting called out there for fist fights, for road rage incidents,

297
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,900
 and for accidents.

298
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,940
 And they've never really been able to figure out why.

299
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,220
 The accidents they can go, people are just going super fast, super straight, and all

300
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,740
 of a sudden the highway will start to turn, start to veer off.

301
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,840
 Those throw internal shells at them.

302
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,880
 The accidents they can kind of figure out.

303
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,440
 But what is it about this road that seems to make people angrier?

304
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,640
 Seems to make people have IED.

305
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
 So they don't know.

306
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,760
 The cops just patrol it like it's any other highway.

307
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,180
 They just know they're going to spend more time on Highway 152 than any other stretch

308
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,240
 of California's highways.

309
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,640
 Some people say that it has an overflow of negative psychic energy, that psychics have

310
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,500
 gone out there and they've been like, "Oh, I'm feeling extra angry.

311
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,740
 There must be some sort of ethereal anger moving through the area."

312
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,980
 They say that as they're punching the reporter, they're giving a quote to strangling them

313
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,220
 out.

314
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,940
 But there's never really been anything to key in on what could have caused this.

315
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,020
 I mean, the road is quite old.

316
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,660
 1849, 1850s, is when this road would have been established.

317
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,500
 Maybe not right at 1849, but this path of roadway has been in operation for over 100

318
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,900
 years at this point.

319
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,280
 Now there is one expert source who thinks they haven't figured out.

320
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
 Backpackerverse.

321
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,240
 Backpackerverse, my favorite new website, thinks it has this figured out.

322
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,320
 In 1800s, there is a local legend that's still told today, but probably only by backpackerverse.

323
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,680
 So since the 1800s, there's been a story of a woman in a 16th century dress walking down

324
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,040
 the highway covered in blood.

325
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,820
 Now I know people don't listen to every episode, but we've talked about backpackerverse before.

326
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,740
 They like to make stuff up.

327
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,100
 And you're like, "Jason, why are you talking about a story you pretty sure is fiction?"

328
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,340
 First off, the first thing I told you about the most dangerous stretch of highway, that

329
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,020
 I've heard from multiple sources.

330
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,900
 And those links are going to be in the show notes.

331
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,420
 All that stuff is more likely to be true than the woman who was seen in the 1800s wearing

332
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,380
 a dress from the 1600s covered in blood.

333
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,040
 Backpackerverse always likes to exaggerate or just make stuff up out of whole cloth.

334
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 But the whole cloth that this...

335
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,280
 Ah, cramp.

336
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
 Ugh.

337
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,120
 But anyways, there's this woman walking around since the 1800s.

338
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,240
 It's so bizarre to me.

339
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,440
 Was there anyone from the 1600s walking around in California?

340
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,960
 That's what I don't understand why she's wearing this old dress.

341
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
 Or was she a woman who died in the 1800s who was like total retro?

342
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
 Like she was a hipster.

343
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
 She's like, "I'm not wearing any of your 18th century clothes.

344
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,340
 I'm only wearing this 16th century stuff."

345
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,060
 Or she was going to a costume party.

346
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,500
 But anyways, apparently there's a specter of a woman dressed like she's from the 1600s

347
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,300
 who walks around this area, walks alone at night, covered in blood.

348
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
 It has to be blood.

349
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,940
 They always throw blood in all of their story.

350
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,420
 So she's covered in blood, which technically I'm going to argue then that it's probably

351
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,780
 not a white dress, which is a detail I didn't add earlier.

352
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,700
 It's a 16th century white dress.

353
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,140
 But if she's covered in blood, how can you tell?

354
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,320
 She walks along this, she makes you get in car accidents, seeing her makes you angry,

355
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
 she raises the psychic energy.

356
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,520
 So they've created an origin story for why this road is so freaky.

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,120
 I think the idea of the road being freaky itself and having some sort of malevolent

358
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,200
 energy, and no one knows why, is actually creepier than making it a woman walking down

359
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,760
 the street covered in blood.

360
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
 Apparently, again, according to Backpackerverse, this story sounds great.

361
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
 Don't think it's true.

362
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 There was a woman named Hattie.

363
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
 Who would name their kid that?

364
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,260
 There's a woman named Hattie who said she found her great grandfather's journal.

365
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,940
 And it told the story that he lived off of Highway 152, way, way back in the olden days.

366
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,180
 And he lived by himself, and he would go out among the trees.

367
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,020
 He would be looking around for squirrels to shoot, or rabbits to pet, whatever.

368
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,860
 And he would see a woman off in the distance, a woman in a white frilly 16th century dress,

369
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,340
 which again, how do people from the 1800s go?

370
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,060
 That's not a modern dress.

371
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
 Like they didn't have photos.

372
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,560
 They didn't know what they looked like, but anyways, he sees a woman in a retro dress,

373
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,280
 and he would see her off in the distance in the forest.

374
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,320
 And then right when he would kind of comprehend that that's out of place, she would disappear,

375
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,840
 and then a heartbeat be standing behind him.

376
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,960
 She would hiss in his ear, and then he would turn and she was gone.

377
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,320
 Now the first time it happened, he thought, oh, that's nothing.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,600
 Like I must be hallucinating during a too much moonshine.

379
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 Whatever.

380
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,300
 But he sees it again a couple days later.

381
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,820
 He sees this figure standing off in the woods.

382
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,460
 And the second he recognizes what it is, he hears that shhhhhhhh.

383
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,900
 Turns around she's gone.

384
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,340
 And what happened was first he saw her every few days, then he started seeing her every

385
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,420
 day he left his cabin.

386
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,940
 And then eventually he saw her multiple times a day, and then he was never seen again.

387
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
 Creepy story.

388
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
 Creepy creepy story.

389
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,720
 Apparently it took place over the course of four months.

390
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,320
 He's writing in his journal the whole time.

391
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,020
 And in 1876 they just found his empty cabin and this journal detailing the story of this

392
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,800
 woman in the white bloody dress.

393
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,160
 Moving about the forest and appearing behind him.

394
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
 I love that story.

395
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,600
 It's a great creepy story, but it's not true.

396
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,400
 I can almost guarantee it's not true.

397
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
 One, for a couple reasons.

398
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,600
 We have no proof that had it exist.

399
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,120
 We have no proof that the diary exists.

400
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,100
 It's definitely something you'd want to take photographs of or sell to the Warrens or sell

401
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,580
 to any ghost hunter.

402
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,820
 It doesn't exist.

403
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,980
 Why is she hissing?

404
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,980
 Kind of weird.

405
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,020
 Well, over the course of four months if you keep going out in the woods and you see a white

406
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,180
 woman covered in blood floating around, and then once you realize that's what she's doing

407
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,740
 she appears behind you and hisses in your ear.

408
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,580
 What's the best way to prevent that?

409
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,780
 Don't go into the woods?

410
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,280
 I mean even if I found a gold vein, even if I was like "Oh yeah, I got all this gold.

411
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,200
 I'm gonna, I'm a pirate now.

412
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,440
 It was first 49er but now I'm a pirate."

413
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,200
 After I saw that, once I went, the first couple of times I'd think "Oh, it was just swamp

414
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
 gas or venus or something like that."

415
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,320
 But after I kept seeing it I would think "I better leave."

416
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,560
 Because if I'm even a miner it doesn't say what this dude did, but let's say I was a

417
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,780
 miner and I have a good gold vein that's keeping me there.

418
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,100
 I just get enough gold to leave and then sell the land to somebody else and not tell them

419
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,740
 about the crazy woman.

420
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,740
 You wouldn't continue to go throughout stuff for four months of this happening.

421
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,580
 That's like, imagine having the worst roommate in the world plus this roommate can teleport

422
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,660
 and is covered in blood.

423
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,300
 How long would you stay with that roommate?

424
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,860
 So that's that story and I love it but I don't think it's real.

425
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,960
 But you're like, "Jason, why are you spending Friday?

426
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,720
 Why are you spending the last episode of the week to talk about backpackerverse?

427
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,680
 Because we know how you feel about backpackerverse.

428
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
 Here's why.

429
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,280
 I said in my intro, the most haunted places that everyone uses.

430
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,360
 So here's one of my theories.

431
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,800
 I want to share one of my theories with you.

432
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:13,080
 I believe, if we believe in the certain ideas of like ghosts are dead people or ghosts are

433
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,840
 spirits, trapped spirits and things like that, people who have died violently.

434
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,900
 There's other theories on ghosts and this one actually works for that too but if we

435
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,660
 take that into account, where do most people die?

436
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,380
 In their homes.

437
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,740
 Most people tend to die in their homes.

438
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,140
 But a good amount of people die on the road.

439
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,340
 They die on highways and city streets.

440
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,220
 When you have a house, so let's say that you die in your house and your ghost is there and

441
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,220
 you're feeling comfortable.

442
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,400
 When another family moves in, you can be like a specter and kind of messing about, mucking

443
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,360
 about, knocking their candles over.

444
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,000
 Don't do that, you'll burn the place down.

445
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,160
 But you know like unscrewing light bulbs, turning the water faucet on, things like that.

446
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,440
 But over time, you may say, you know, it's time for me to move on.

447
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,160
 Like this isn't my home anymore.

448
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,280
 They've changed everything.

449
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,240
 They put up that Metallica poster.

450
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,960
 I like Slayer.

451
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,880
 This is too much and your spirit leaves.

452
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
 And that may be why we don't have a ton of home hauntings.

453
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,940
 That may be why we don't always have a ghost in a house where somebody died.

454
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,660
 But nobody's home is the road, except for maybe like Johnny Cash.

455
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,700
 Nobody's home is the road.

456
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,340
 You are driving down the road to go home and you die.

457
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,340
 You are by all respects really trapped in limbo.

458
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,980
 You're not at your workplace, you're not at home.

459
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,420
 You're not at your school, you're not at home.

460
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,300
 You're not at your friend's house, you're not at home.

461
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,620
 You're trapped in between these places.

462
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,520
 And it's the one place your spirit couldn't find rest.

463
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,960
 Your car crashes, you have a heart attack while you're driving, you choke on a chicken

464
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,920
 bone because you're eating KFC, driving down the road to go 80 miles an hour.

465
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 You die.

466
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,400
 Ambulance shows up, puts you in the back, drives you away.

467
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,440
 But your spirit stays there.

468
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,960
 It's trapped in a sense that it doesn't have another place to go.

469
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,560
 It is, by all accounts, limbo on earth.

470
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,220
 And it's the one place that can't be investigated.

471
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,740
 Are you going to have a paranormal crew stop every mile down the road and spend a couple

472
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,820
 hours out there or a couple days taking readings and then drive another mile down and do another

473
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,480
 thing?

474
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,340
 Every stretch of road and every stretch of highway has had numerous deaths.

475
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,780
 A house that was built in the 50s may have only had one person dying it.

476
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,500
 A house built in the 1800s may have had five people dying it.

477
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,000
 But a stretch of road connecting the house from the 50s in the house in the 1800s could

478
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,320
 have had 10,000 people die on it over the course of those 150 years.

479
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,560
 That actually might be a bit high.

480
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,120
 But you know what I'm getting at?

481
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,800
 Hundreds if not thousands of people could die on the same stretch of road between those

482
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,840
 two places where one person died or five people died.

483
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,480
 Yet we always concentrate on haunted houses, haunted churches, haunted asylums.

484
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,780
 And think about how many people die on the freeway versus how many people die in an asylum.

485
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,500
 Some people say that ghosts are psychic energy.

486
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,560
 It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to die there to leave some sort of psychic

487
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
 residue.

488
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,740
 You could have a horrible fight, you could have a horrible heartbreak and you're leaving

489
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,780
 a piece of yourself there.

490
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,660
 Where do you do most of your thinking?

491
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,980
 Shower, yes, sure, but driving.

492
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,900
 It's generally when you are alone or when you're with someone and they're nagging you

493
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,400
 the whole way or your kids are screaming in the back seat and you're thinking, "I wish

494
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,760
 I was 25, I wish I learned how to play the guitar, I wish I had done something."

495
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,960
 You're leaving that little bit of psychic energy every time you drive to the job you

496
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,360
 hate or driving from the job you love back to the home where you don't feel welcome.

497
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,560
 You're leaving a bit of psychic energy on the side of the road.

498
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,240
 We travel so fast down the road.

499
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,500
 Unless it was a phantom hitchhiker or something, a woman in an old dress covered in blood

500
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,300
 standing on the side of the road, you wouldn't notice the specter standing on the side of

501
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,380
 the road.

502
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:22,820
 You wouldn't notice the grieving spirit, you wouldn't notice the angry poltergeist, you

503
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,660
 wouldn't pick up on any of these things.

504
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,460
 You're driving from one location to another.

505
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:40,400
 But that road you travel down may be littered with ghosts, spirits, poltergeists, and the

506
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:50,560
 damned watching you underneath the darkened streetlight, behind the grass, just out of

507
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,360
 sight.

508
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,520
 And the next time you're driving down that road, take a look in the rearview mirror.

509
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,980
 See if you see anything out of the ordinary.

510
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,500
 Because if you do, if you see a trapped lonely spirit walking down the road, you may drive

511
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,220
 a little safer so you don't share its fate.

512
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,700
