1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 A small-town journalist may have found the key that can unlock the mysteries of why some people experience

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,680
 paranormal phenomenon.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,880
 They would take a look at an old Native American story

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,520
 about a cave hidden out in the wilderness.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,040
 It would sing of the song of death, warning you not to come in,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,120
 but warrior after warrior ventured into its dark depths.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:37,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,160
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,960
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,400
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,320
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,080
 Mikael Malone.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,280
 Mikael Malone, thank you so much for supporting the show.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
 Really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
 Just help get the word out about the show.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
 That also helps out a lot.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
 So Mikael, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason's Loppy.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 But Mikael, hold on to those keys for a second,

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
 because before we go anywhere, you can spin them around on your finger if you want.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,680
 You know, keep yourself busy.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,160
 So I did a Patreon exclusive live stream on YouTube.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
 So it's something I was testing out.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 I didn't really announce it ahead.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,720
 I announced it ahead of time on the Patreon,

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
 but I didn't use it as a marketing ploy to get more people to join,

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,200
 because we're just kind of testing it out.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
 At the end of the live stream, it went really well.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,200
 Had a lot of fun talking to you guys.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
 It was like two hours long.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
 At the end of the live stream, Barfiman,

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
 one of the longtime supporters of the show,

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,040
 said, "Hey, did you know Chadwick Boseman died?"

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,720
 And of course, I didn't believe it, right?

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
 Because we were all joking around, talking about,

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
 you know, which Nickelodeon show was better than Disney Channel show.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
 And then we would start talking about conspiracies for a bit,

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
 and then go back to like 90s cartoons.

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,160
 It was a lot of fun.

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
 But yeah, yeah, Chadwick Boseman passed away.

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,040
 I obviously know that you guys probably know this at this point.

45
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
 It's, you know, it's weird.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,040
 It's really weird.

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,960
 He's only the second superhero to die you had.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,640
 And it really, he's the first of the second wave of these movies.

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,120
 Even going all the way back to Blade.

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
 You have Wesley Snipes from there on.

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,480
 He was the first one to pass away.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
 The only other one that I could think of in my lifetime was Christopher Reeve, Superman.

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
 And even that, you know, he got injured and then he was alive for a long time.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
 And he overcame, although that horrible injury he suffered,

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,120
 and eventually he passed away.

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,240
 And then you have Chadwick, the same thing.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
 So it's quite the blow.

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,200
 It's, and I get it, listen, I get it,

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
 because I know some people are probably saying,

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
 you know, Jason, people die every day,

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
 and people die every day from what he died of,

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 which was colon cancer.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
 And I get that.

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
 I'm not diminishing.

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
 And I hope no one thinks anyone's diminishing that.

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
 But when you have a hypo, I'll tell you this right now.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,000
 This is what I think.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,520
 So he was battling colon cancer,

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,760
 stage three colon cancer for four years.

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
 And even though he died, he won that battle.

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
 And I'm going to tell you why.

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
 Myself, and I can guarantee you,

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
 500,000 other people this week

74
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,240
 are going to call up their doctor and schedule a colonoscopy.

75
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
 I can guarantee it.

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,760
 And out of those 500,000 people around the world

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,600
 who get it tested, maybe 5% of them have something.

78
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
 But those 5% of them, their doctor's going to look at them

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,480
 and go, "You're really lucky you came in

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
 and got tested when you did.

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
 We can take care of this."

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,800
 His death will save lives.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 And that may be a small consolation

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
 for the people who loved him, for his fans, for, you know.

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,560
 But really, when you have somebody

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,800
 that high-profile die of a disease like that,

87
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,520
 I, we finished off the live stream,

88
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
 and I had to do some other work.

89
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,880
 But then I spent the night and I was looking,

90
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
 "What are the risk factors for this?"

91
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,680
 Oh, it's basically being alive in the year 2020.

92
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
 Sitting all day long, being overweight,

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,520
 having a diet of meats and processed foods.

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
 These are all things that a lot of people do.

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
 It's just, I can guarantee you,

96
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,880
 people's lives will be saved because Chadwick Boseman died.

97
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,320
 So he may have passed away,

98
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,800
 but he won that battle against colon cancer

99
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
 because people will get screened for it.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
 It will be caught in time.

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
 Their lives will be saved.

102
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,600
 And what more can you ask as a superhero

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
 than your legacy to be?

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
 You saved thousands of lives around the world.

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,200
 So I, that's, and if you are in that risk factor,

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,520
 if you live in the year 2020,

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
 make an appointment, get tested.

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,720
 You know.

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
 Honor his memory by having a camera stuck up your colon.

110
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,240
 It's not fun.

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
 I've done it before.

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,320
 It wasn't fun.

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,480
 We talked about that on the live stream,

114
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,040
 but I think his legacy will be literally tens of thousands

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,320
 of people having their cancer caught early enough

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
 that it can be treated.

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
 So let's go ahead, Mikhail.

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
 Mikhail, stop spinning the keys halfway through that.

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
 He's like, huh, you know,

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
 he's just kind of holding his hands.

121
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,800
 But let's go, Mikhail.

122
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
 Let's go on a fun adventure.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,080
 Now, again, we got a lot of stuff to cover here.

124
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
 So first off, let's hop in that Jason Jalopy.

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
 We are going to drive out to Idaho.

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
 We got it revved up.

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
 Dude, this is a good little Jason Jalopy.

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
 We got a new engine and we got a V8.

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,800
 Neer passing up all those other lame cars,

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,600
 throwing tomatoes.

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,840
 I don't mind just having to stop at a tomato stand

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,240
 as we crossed into the Idaho State border,

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
 throwing tomatoes at people.

134
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
 Here we're going to meet a journalist.

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
 Her name is Becky Cook.

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,640
 Now, she was writing for a really, really small town newspaper

137
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,360
 called the Intermountain Farm and Ranch.

138
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
 So actually it's not even a town newspaper.

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
 It's just a collection of farm and ranch newspapers.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
 Had the paper boy must have the best calves ever.

141
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,600
 He's just pedaling.

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
 He's like, throws the newspaper and he's like,

143
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
 "Ten moms to the next farm."

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
 He's like, "Dude, dude, dude, dude."

145
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
 He sees the Jason Jalopy goes by.

146
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
 He's like, "Can you give me a lift?"

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
 We're throwing tomatoes at him.

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,760
 He's like, "Oh, man."

149
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,040
 So anyways, she writes for the Intermountain.

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,280
 Oh, there's a mountain in between the farm and the ranches too.

151
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
 So that boy just must be super swole.

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,200
 That paper boy's a muscle man.

153
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,560
 Intermountain Farm and Ranch.

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
 She wrote an article.

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
 She would just write articles about farms and ranches

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
 in the cereal tomato thrower that stops your newspapers

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,240
 from being delivered.

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,720
 And then once she did a story about a guy who said he saw Bigfoot.

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,640
 She thought it was a kind of an interesting story.

160
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,960
 And the editor kind of chuckled and they published it.

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
 It in the newspaper sold out.

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
 Apparently they don't have the internet up there.

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
 They just can't go on the internet or read the article.

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,320
 The newspaper sold out.

165
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,920
 They had to do a second printing.

166
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,080
 The story doesn't take place in the 1940s either.

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,040
 This takes place now.

168
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
 This woman's still alive.

169
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
 So it's not like 1892 and they're like,

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,640
 "What? What's a bicycle?"

171
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,360
 It's nowadays.

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,640
 So the newspaper sold out to that poor paper boy.

173
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,840
 Then he gets a phone call.

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,760
 "Hey, can you deliver another copy of that paper?"

175
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
 He's like, "Ahh."

176
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
 Yes, he's on.

177
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,280
 Dude, let me just drink all this creatine.

178
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,040
 Anyway, so she runs the story on Bigfoot.

179
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,440
 Now what's interesting was it was a huge hit.

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
 And her editor was like,

181
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
 "Hey, how about you do a story about ghosts for Halloween?

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
 That'll get them rubes by in her newspaper."

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,240
 And she said, "No, my heart really wasn't in it."

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
 And she started researching Bigfoot.

185
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,800
 She started specifically looking at Bigfoot stories in Idaho.

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
 Since then, she's collected 60 stories

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 where she's sitting down and interviewing these people,

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
 which is really the dream of paranormal investigators,

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,880
 I think.

190
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,640
 It's just do sit down interviews.

191
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,400
 And she's become an author.

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 She's written three books all about Bigfoot.

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,840
 It's all just a collection of stories.

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,120
 Now she ends up becoming the news

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
 because now she's this small town,

196
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,320
 it's not even small town,

197
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,840
 this small geographical region newspaper journalist

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
 who now has really kind of made a living writing about Bigfoot.

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
 So she got interviewed by that big city newspaper,

200
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
 East Idaho News.

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
 So I came across this and this interview

202
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,480
 with the East Idaho News.

203
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,080
 Very fascinating thing.

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
 So what she explains to the East Idaho News

205
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
 is that among the people that she's interviewed,

206
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,240
 70% of them, so way more than just chance,

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,480
 70% of the people she's interviewed

208
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,440
 have had at least one near-death experience.

209
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,320
 And she said that may be why they can see these things

210
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
 in the first place.

211
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,440
 That's fascinating detail.

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
 I know people have said,

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,280
 well, you know, sometimes near-death experience

214
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
 can open the third eye,

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
 but for someone to say,

216
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,120
 and also Bigfoot is considered a physical phenomenon.

217
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
 We talk about interdimensional Bigfoot on this show.

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,960
 We talk about phantasmal Bigfoot and all that stuff,

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,480
 but generally Bigfoot is considered a biological creature.

220
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,880
 And we have someone who's written three books on the subject,

221
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
 interviewed over 60 different people,

222
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,240
 sit down, interview people.

223
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,040
 70% of them have had at least one near-death experience.

224
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,280
 That is a really interesting statistic.

225
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,520
 And again, because it would be one thing if 70% of people

226
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,840
 who saw ghosts had a near-death experience.

227
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
 You go, yeah, it makes sense.

228
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
 She came close.

229
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
 You got your face pressed against the ghost glass

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
 and you're looking into heaven, hopefully, right?

231
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
 And then you got sucked back down to earth.

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,200
 So it would make sense that the veil was thinner for you,

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,400
 but because Bigfoot is generally considered a biological phenomenon

234
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,120
 that leaves evidence, footprints, poop, hair, things like that,

235
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
 why would having a near-death experience,

236
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
 that'd be like saying,

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
 you 70% of people who have near-death experiences also see rhinos.

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
 Because a rhino is a real thing.

239
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,720
 And if the Bigfoot is generally considered a biological entity,

240
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,120
 there shouldn't be any difference, right?

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
 It shouldn't matter whether or not you had a near-death experience or not.

242
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
 You should, a rhino is a rhino.

243
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,240
 So that's just kind of one of those little interesting tidbits

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
 of information that we can kind of file away in our brain.

245
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
 Does having a near-death experience,

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
 well, there's a couple things we can pull away from this.

247
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
 One, does having a near-death experience

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
 make you more prone to seeing things like this,

249
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
 seeing supernatural?

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,960
 That almost seems like a given, right?

251
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
 I've never had a near-death experience

252
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
 where I've seen a tunnel of light or anything like that.

253
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
 I've come very close to dying.

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
 Like barely got away from dying.

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,840
 But that's not really what they mean by near-death experience.

256
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,440
 That's where you die.

257
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,560
 Your soul leaves your body.

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,440
 It goes somewhere.

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
 Again, hopefully, heaven, right?

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,520
 And then we've done episodes about people

261
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,280
 who have had near-death experience for hell.

262
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,560
 That was a really cool episode.

263
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
 But I've never had anything like that.

264
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,080
 And I've had paranormal experiences.

265
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,000
 So, but we have that.

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
 You would think if someone had a paranormal experience,

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,080
 i.e. a near-death experience,

268
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,560
 it would make them more likely to be able to see weird stuff.

269
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,840
 But does that even play into things like cryptids?

270
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
 And actually, now I just thought of this.

271
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,240
 What about all of the old stories of shamans

272
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
 who were constantly walking around?

273
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,080
 I don't understand how any of them live to be past the age of 20

274
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
 because they're constantly walking around eating stuff and going,

275
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,160
 "Vision quest, vision quest."

276
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
 And then eventually they're going to get to the poison berries, right?

277
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
 Like the poison berries are just sitting at the edge of the forest going,

278
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
 "Hehehe, let's look nice and shiny for that shaman over there."

279
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
 How did they live?

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
 Because they're constantly testing stuff out.

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,120
 Maybe they had a bunch of kids with them.

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,200
 Maybe they had a bunch of nephews and they're like,

283
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
 "Hey, Jerry, go eat that delicious berry over there."

284
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
 And he's like, "Okay, that's not part of my vision quest."

285
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
 He sees the other kids tripping out, looking at their hands.

286
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 He's like, "Now that's a vision quest."

287
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
 He pushes the kids out of the way.

288
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
 They were constantly testing these.

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,080
 I don't actually don't know if that's...

290
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,280
 I don't know if shamans were basically Willy Wonka.

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,040
 They had a bunch of oompa-loompas running experiments on every edible thing.

292
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
 But to stumble across the stuff that would give you a vision quest,

293
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,640
 you would have to smoke the forest, right?

294
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,080
 You'd have to eat everything.

295
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,880
 You'd have to eat every mushroom before you found a magic mushroom.

296
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
 And then you could pass that information on and say,

297
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
 "Hey, dude, stay away from those mushrooms."

298
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,520
 But even then, the guy who ate that one and died in the forest,

299
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,880
 they wouldn't know.

300
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,520
 So what if that is where we get all these legends of cryptids,

301
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,320
 or the legends of these legends where you had shaman

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 who had near-death experiences,

303
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,520
 and then you could have warrior after warrior go into the Amazon jungle

304
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,400
 and not see anything.

305
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,920
 And then one day, the shaman comes walking back into the village.

306
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,680
 And he's like, "Oh, guys, listen, dude, there's some headless mule out there.

307
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
 Stay away from me, dude.

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
 It looks like a hot woman, but just stay away from me."

309
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,840
 Everyone's like, "What? I didn't see anything."

310
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,880
 But because he had that near-death experience,

311
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
 he was able to see those cryptids that were walking around.

312
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,040
 I don't know.

313
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
 It's an interesting fact.

314
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,640
 I don't really know where to go with it,

315
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,040
 but it's another key in that mystery.

316
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,080
 Why are some people able to see this stuff and others aren't?

317
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,520
 Does it have something to do with the fact that they almost died

318
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,800
 and their consciousness was unlocked a little bit?

319
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
 Who knows?

320
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,840
 But Becky Cook, great looking out.

321
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,640
 Again, that was just, I was reading an article about her

322
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,120
 and that little nugget was buried in the middle of it.

323
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,600
 I was like, "That's a really important fact for any paranormal investigator."

324
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,520
 Or even Bigfoot Researcher, right?

325
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,960
 You have those people on those Squatch on Teen Shows on AMC.

326
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 They're like, "Hit me up with more ketamine, man."

327
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,920
 They should do a whole episode where they're constantly trying to die.

328
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,960
 They're like, "Ugh."

329
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,240
 It's just a reality show and everyone's kind of unconscious,

330
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
 so then someone wakes them up.

331
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,760
 They're like, "Ugh.

332
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,800
 Bigfoot, Bigfoot's right behind you.

333
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,320
 I spent years looking for him.

334
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
 All I had to do was die and come back to life."

335
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
 And the Bigfoot's standing outside waving.

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
 Cameraman can't film it.

337
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
 And then the guy's like, "Oh, you can see it."

338
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
 He's like walking towards the camera,

339
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,080
 he's strangling the cameraman.

340
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,520
 "Mackayle, let's go ahead and fire up that carboner copter

341
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,080
 as we watch this Squatch Hunter commit multiple near homicide."

342
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
 Because he doesn't really kill him.

343
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,920
 He brings him back to life.

344
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,440
 I think that's just assault.

345
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
 I think that's just attempted murder at that point.

346
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
 "Mackayle, let's fire up that carboner copter.

347
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,640
 We're leaving behind this crime scene before the cops show up.

348
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,440
 We are headed out to Wisconsin."

349
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
 As we're flying out there,

350
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,240
 I want to make another real quick announcement.

351
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
 I've started changing up the art for the show.

352
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,400
 We're going back to kind of the default Dead Rabbit logo.

353
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,640
 I've been reading some books on branding recently,

354
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,760
 how to build your brand online.

355
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 So we're going to that basic logo,

356
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,080
 but it doesn't mean that I still,

357
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,640
 I love getting fan art from you guys.

358
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,080
 So if you guys send me fan art,

359
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,840
 I got a piece from Pauly recently.

360
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,240
 And what I need is if you send me a piece of fan art

361
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
 and say, "I allow you to use this."

362
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
 You can use this on your podcast.

363
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
 I would like to do a fan art Friday.

364
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,880
 Wherever you show often,

365
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,520
 I can show off some of your great artwork.

366
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
 I was cycling through it too much

367
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,040
 and I even was having someone look at it

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
 and they go, "What's your brand?"

369
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,840
 Like, I don't have a brand.

370
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,800
 So we're going back to that default Dead Rabbit logo for a while,

371
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,520
 but I've loved all the artwork I've gotten so far.

372
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,760
 And it's been great.

373
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,520
 I got John and Ashley and Robert and Grant.

374
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,920
 You guys have done amazing jobs with the artwork.

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,360
 And I'm going to keep it obviously.

376
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,320
 I'm thinking about,

377
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 I don't know, I was thinking about like framing it

378
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 and putting it up.

379
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,720
 And it probably will show back up in those fan art Fridays.

380
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
 But if you guys have artwork

381
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
 that I can put down into the specifications

382
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
 of what iTunes wants, we'll mix it up.

383
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,080
 I was mixing it up too much.

384
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,720
 So that's why I'm just getting in front of stuff.

385
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
 I'm sure that people will go,

386
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,520
 "Hey, how come you went back to that logo?"

387
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,360
 That's why, because I bought a bunch of books on Humble Bundle,

388
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,320
 talking about branding,

389
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
 and I've talked to some branding people as well.

390
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,080
 So, Mikhail's like, "Try on his shoulders."

391
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,000
 He's like, "Dude, we're flying to Wisconsin.

392
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
 What are you talking about?

393
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
 We're just like looping around the state.

394
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,440
 Where are we going?"

395
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,400
 I'm like, "Sorry, sorry."

396
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,680
 Just wanted to, I told you,

397
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
 a lot of stuff in this episode.

398
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,840
 Pay attention.

399
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
 Not you.

400
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,760
 You just fly.

401
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
 You just fly the copter.

402
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,360
 We're going back in time to the year 1887.

403
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,560
 So let's land this carpenter copter in Richland City.

404
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,080
 Nowadays, it's known as Richland Center.

405
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,560
 But at this time, it was known as Richland City.

406
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,080
 And we see a man,

407
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,160
 he's writing a letter to his friend

408
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
 because he's a nerd.

409
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
 And that's why they talked to each other back then.

410
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,840
 They couldn't do emojis over telegrams.

411
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,520
 I actually have an episode about that coming up.

412
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,280
 But probably gave it away.

413
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,920
 Just gave it away.

414
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,640
 But anyways, he's writing stuff down.

415
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,240
 He folds the letter up.

416
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
 You guys know how letters work.

417
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,760
 Anyways, so this guy named Paul Sefer

418
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,240
 is reconnecting with an old friend in Austria,

419
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,640
 this Austrian scientist who's unnamed.

420
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,440
 This is as real as the stories you can get though.

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
 There's a lot of great sources for this.

422
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,040
 We're going to call this guy Arnold,

423
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
 this Austrian scientist.

424
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,640
 So Paul's writing this letter to Arnold.

425
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,600
 And he's like, hey, dude, I finally settled down in Richland City.

426
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
 It's really cool out here.

427
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
 A lot of awesome stuff.

428
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
 I've met a woman, had some kids.

429
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,680
 You know how sex works?

430
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
 You know how procreation works?

431
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
 Sincerely, Paul, that was the whole letter.

432
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
 He mails it off to Arnold.

433
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 And him and Arnold start communicating back and forth

434
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,320
 of these letters.

435
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,880
 Now Arnold, he goes, hey, I've heard a lot

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,640
 about those American aborigines,

437
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,560
 which I guess was the term used back then in 1887,

438
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,920
 in Austria at least.

439
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
 Because I've heard stuff about those American aborigines.

440
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
 Could you send me some of those artifacts?

441
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
 Which nowadays is a crime, right?

442
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
 Nowadays is actually--

443
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
 It was a crime back then.

444
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
 But nowadays, it's basically a federal crime.

445
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
 Back then, it was just like, dude,

446
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
 why are you ransacking that grave?

447
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
 Which I think was just grave robbing,

448
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,760
 which may be a misdemeanor.

449
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,000
 But anyways, lobby damned.

450
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,600
 Paul writes back to Arnold and goes, oh, yeah,

451
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,360
 you want some Native Americans

452
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,680
 to be a little more politically correct?

453
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,920
 He scratches out American aborigine.

454
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,600
 You want some Native American stuff?

455
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,560
 Yeah, sure.

456
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,320
 And he begins sending Arnold these riches,

457
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,240
 like beautiful artifacts forged from indigenous people.

458
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,200
 Arnold writes back to Paul and goes,

459
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,280
 where are you getting these things?

460
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
 Paul says, you got to come out and visit.

461
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
 I got the bulk of this info.

462
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
 This guy must be all he does with his life.

463
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,280
 And I'm not saying that as an insult.

464
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,360
 This dude has created this amazing website,

465
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,320
 which I believe is taken from a book he wrote.

466
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
 We're going to mostly, pretty much,

467
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,760
 all be sourcing the encyclopedia of Winnipego mythology.

468
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
 This is written by Richard L. D. Terrell.

469
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,080
 Sorry, Richard, for mispronouncing your name,

470
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,520
 but thank you for writing this.

471
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,840
 So let's go back in time.

472
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
 Now the carbonar copter has just become a tree

473
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
 because it's hidden.

474
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
 And we might need it to get away at some point,

475
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,520
 but we can't.

476
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
 We are now long, long ago.

477
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,040
 This place was dominated by the Winnipego tribe.

478
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,440
 So long before Pilgrims showed up, any of that stuff,

479
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,920
 there's a couple of little Winnipego tribe kids

480
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,520
 running around playing tag.

481
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,080
 You're it.

482
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,960
 No, you're it.

483
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
 So fun if there's only two kids, right?

484
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
 That's kind of a boring game of tag.

485
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,120
 I guess that's just chasing somebody that's not even really

486
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
 tagged, but they're running through and people in the

487
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
 village are like, you guys better come back soon.

488
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
 Actually, no, I'm looking at my notes.

489
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
 They went out to hunt deer.

490
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,840
 They weren't doing much of horseplay.

491
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
 They weren't even horses back then.

492
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
 They're like, don't do any of that play.

493
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
 The kids were like, what?

494
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
 Everyone pauses every time they say it.

495
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,560
 These kids were actually efficient deer hunters.

496
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
 There was no goofing off.

497
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,880
 There was no goofing off in this tribe.

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
 I mean, I'm sure they did have some fun,

499
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,560
 but they didn't want their kids to just run off into the woods.

500
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,200
 So they're on a mission.

501
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
 They go out to go deer hunting, but two days pass.

502
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,600
 They don't come home.

503
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,040
 So a couple of warriors go, let's go find them.

504
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,960
 So Great Eagle, who's the head of the tribe.

505
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
 Great Eagle gets wind of this that two kids are missing.

506
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,920
 Now they have been squabbling with other rival tribes in the area.

507
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,360
 So he sends off a couple of warriors.

508
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
 She's like, go find those kids, bring them back.

509
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
 Don't tell them not to commit any play.

510
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
 And the warriors, they know exactly what that pause means.

511
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
 They just kind of nod their heads.

512
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,720
 They go off.

513
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,560
 They begin trailing these kids.

514
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
 They're finding little footprints in the mud,

515
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,760
 footprints in the mud.

516
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,880
 I think it's the actual, is it?

517
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
 Footprints?

518
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,360
 It doesn't matter.

519
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,400
 It doesn't matter.

520
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,680
 They're just walking by.

521
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
 They're having this argument.

522
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,680
 They're like, it's footprints.

523
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
 No, it's footprints.

524
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
 Anyways, these warriors, there's about eight of them.

525
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,560
 Get to where they see the trail

526
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,920
 lead into a cave.

527
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 A here to undiscovered cave.

528
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,480
 That's quite a ways away from the village.

529
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
 I go, oh, the kids must be in the cave.

530
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
 Hopefully they're not in the belly of a bear

531
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,360
 or fell in it or something like that.

532
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
 But we'll just go in and get them.

533
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,720
 So two of the warriors, they go into the cave.

534
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 They don't come out.

535
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,640
 Instead, what comes out is what's known as in this paper,

536
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
 the death song of an Indian.

537
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,440
 In Native American culture, one of the things that they would do

538
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,800
 is before you were tortured or executed or both, preferably,

539
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 save the torture for after I'm executed, guys.

540
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,320
 I've been doing some Groucho Marx routine.

541
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,840
 You would sing the death song.

542
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,600
 It was a very defiant song.

543
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
 You knew you were going to die.

544
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,320
 This is where you basically your last words.

545
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
 Sometimes they had to think of the prisoner's dance,

546
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,680
 where they would tie your elbows behind your back.

547
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,280
 Your wrists in front of you, very uncomfortable position,

548
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
 give you like a shaker, like a rattle,

549
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
 and tie your ankles together,

550
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
 and they would make you dance through town.

551
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,520
 But while you were dancing through town,

552
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,480
 you would sing the death song of an Indian.

553
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
 It would be your last words.

554
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
 I don't think it had to be anything in particular.

555
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
 I think they're like, "No, you got the lyrics wrong.

556
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,920
 Do it again."

557
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 And you're like, "Okay, I'm just going to keep getting it wrong

558
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,280
 so you never torture me to death."

559
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,800
 But I think it was you basically being like,

560
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,520
 "I'm innocent of this crime.

561
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,880
 Okay, I did a little bit of it, but it didn't really mean to."

562
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,680
 And people were like, "What?"

563
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,640
 So it was basically your final words.

564
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,400
 The death song of an Indian.

565
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,280
 They didn't call it that.

566
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
 They had a tribal word for it,

567
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,720
 but that's what it was called in this paperwork.

568
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
 So anyways, so these warriors are standing outside the cave,

569
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,960
 and they hear the death song coming out of the cave,

570
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
 and they're like, "Uh, that's not...

571
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,440
 That's never good, right?

572
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,160
 That's never good."

573
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,320
 The sun's starting to set,

574
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,560
 and the warriors go, "Well, we got it.

575
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
 Now we got to go in and get the two dudes who went in there.

576
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,480
 Maybe they wrestled and fell down off a cliff."

577
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,400
 People were like, "Okay, maybe, but who's singing this song?

578
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,280
 I don't know.

579
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
 Why don't you go in and find out?"

580
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So two of them say, "Tell you what, we'll stay outside.

581
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,960
 The rest of you go inside, find out what happened,

582
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
 bring everyone out, hopefully bring the kids out too."

583
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
 The warriors grab their weapons,

584
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,440
 march into the dark mouth of the cave,

585
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,280
 and the two braves are sitting out there, sun setting.

586
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,800
 They hear the death song coming out of the cave.

587
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,520
 They wait until dusk, sitting outside of that cave.

588
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,840
 And they're like, "No one's coming out of there."

589
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 And we are not going in there, so they go back to the village.

590
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,040
 Next morning, Great Eagle is like,

591
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
 "Oh, man, what a relaxing night.

592
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
 I hope there's no bad news today.

593
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
 I hope they found those kids safe and sound.

594
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,600
 Really could use some dear jerky."

595
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,640
 And then he's like, "Oh, great,

596
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,320
 as he just sees the two dudes walking from his group that he sent off."

597
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
 So he brings 100 warriors.

598
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,960
 This was a huge tribe in the area.

599
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 He brings 100 warriors to the cave.

600
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,160
 And he's like, "Okay, this is pretty easy to figure out.

601
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,440
 Let's just send a bunch of people in."

602
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
 And like, "That works, right?

603
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,160
 Guys, right?"

604
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,920
 He turns around to the two people who told him,

605
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,960
 "Sorry, that works, right?

606
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
 We send people in, they're going to come out."

607
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,480
 And the two warriors are like, "No, that's why we're here, dude."

608
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
 Great Eagle's like, "Okay, we'll try."

609
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,920
 So he sends in 30 warriors and five torchbearers.

610
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,760
 Which I'm sure the torchbearers were going first.

611
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,680
 There's no point having a torch behind you.

612
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,280
 They go into this cave and then the death song starts.

613
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,440
 Great Eagle's like, "Okay, probably not best plan,

614
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,560
 but I didn't really like those warriors anyways."

615
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,800
 And those torchbearers didn't know how to bear a torch

616
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,920
 so they could save a life.

617
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,560
 And they couldn't because they're probably all dead.

618
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,040
 So then he goes, "Okay, I got a new plan, guys.

619
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,000
 Everyone hold each other's hands and form a human chain.

620
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,880
 And then, like, you just couldn't pull people out.

621
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,200
 Makes sense and makes sense on paper.

622
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,160
 Because this is the working theory at this point.

623
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,840
 The sound, the death song, whatever that is,

624
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,280
 this is the working theory at the point.

625
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,880
 Something in there is killing these men, or they're falling off a cliff.

626
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,600
 And really the most likely thing is they're falling off a cliff.

627
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
 Because they're not hearing sounds of battle.

628
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,920
 They're probably falling to their death.

629
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 So if we have a human chain, if the first guy stumbles, there you go.

630
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,120
 They form this human chain.

631
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
 They're going in.

632
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
 Now, somebody had to be the first dude, right?

633
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,640
 Somebody had to lose.

634
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
 But I guess you're probably trying to prove how brave they are.

635
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,640
 They're going in the chain.

636
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,240
 This chain's going into the darkness.

637
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,920
 And you have the first guy, second guy, third guy, all the way down.

638
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,360
 And as they're going through, at a certain point,

639
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,160
 the second guy turns to the third guy and goes,

640
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,840
 "I can't feel the first guy any-"

641
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,320
 And the third guy realizes that he can't feel the second guy's arm.

642
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,680
 He's not holding it anymore.

643
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
 Completely disappeared in his grasp.

644
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,040
 At that point, pull me up.

645
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,440
 Oh, dude, dude, his experiment's over, bro.

646
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,320
 Experiment's over.

647
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,200
 The whole line comes back out.

648
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,480
 And that third guy is like, "Listen, it's not a cliff in there."

649
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
 And it's definitely not anything killing.

650
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,440
 Like, something's killing them, I'm guessing.

651
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
 But it's not a cliff.

652
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,560
 I didn't feel anyone drop it.

653
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,560
 And here anything, he goes, "That dude, that dude just disappeared."

654
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
 Like, I was holding- I couldn't see him.

655
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
 Probably could have had a torch bearer up here.

656
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,640
 But I just lost grip of him.

657
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 Like, we were holding each other's hands,

658
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,240
 and then I was holding nothing.

659
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,560
 Great Eagle goes, "Okay, what's stronger than the grasp of a firm man-"

660
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,200
 There's some woman over there smoking a cigarette.

661
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,560
 She's like, "Nothing, baby."

662
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,600
 He's like, "Ignore her. Ignore the village harlot."

663
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,160
 No, you know what's stronger than the grasp of a strong man?

664
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
 Is a sturdy rope.

665
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
 So they get a rope.

666
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,000
 Again, dude, people are volunteering for this,

667
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,880
 because they want to show Great Eagle how brave they are.

668
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,160
 Guys are like, "I'll do it, I'll do it."

669
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,760
 And nobody's stopping them.

670
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
 He's like, "Step aside, guys.

671
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,320
 Let me see how it's done."

672
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,520
 And everyone's like pushing him forward.

673
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,040
 They're like, "Dude, do it.

674
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
 Show me how it's done. I want to know.

675
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
 I'm definitely not volunteering."

676
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,760
 They tie rope around his waist.

677
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,080
 Now, they say- this is, again, they're not just like,

678
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,120
 "Well, just run in there."

679
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,720
 They say, "You walk in and then keep tugging it.

680
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,760
 Keep tugging the rope.

681
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,440
 You just keep tugging the rope the whole time.

682
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,720
 Take a couple steps, tug.

683
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,080
 Take a couple steps, tug."

684
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,360
 If you stop tugging, we're immediately going to yank you back.

685
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,160
 So hopefully, you're not gassy or anything like that.

686
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,760
 Hopefully, you didn't just eat a deer.

687
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
 You're just going to throw up.

688
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,720
 And the guy's like, "No, I got it."

689
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,960
 So he's walking into the cave and he tugs a bit,

690
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
 walks in, tugs a bit, walks in, tugs a bit.

691
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
 And he's constantly- like, he's not taking like,

692
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
 walking 10 feet and then tugging it.

693
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
 He's constantly like, tugging it.

694
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,040
 The guy's holding the rope probably burning their hands.

695
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,880
 They're like, "Oh, I hope this guy disappears.

696
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,440
 He's a jerk."

697
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,040
 Eventually, they stop feeling the tug on the rope.

698
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,360
 And the men immediately yank the rope.

699
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,440
 There's nothing on it.

700
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,920
 It's just a loop.

701
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,120
 And Great Eagle's like, "Oh, I actually kind of like that guy.

702
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,280
 Actually, that was the first one that I actually

703
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,000
 feel bad about.

704
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,120
 I actually like that dude.

705
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,600
 Barry!"

706
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,840
 Now, each time- I forgot this detail-

707
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,640
 each time people disappeared in the cave,

708
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
 the death song would start up again.

709
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,280
 Forgot that detail.

710
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
 Sorry, I got a little carried away.

711
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
 So this is constantly going on.

712
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,160
 And Great Eagle's like, "Okay, we first off,

713
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,000
 we got to have a massive funeral for Barry,

714
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
 because of that dude, that guy was close to my heart.

715
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,840
 And the rest of them will put up,

716
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,520
 I don't know, some tombstones or something like that.

717
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,680
 But no one else can come to this cave.

718
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,880
 No one else can come to this cave.

719
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,000
 Too spooky.

720
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,280
 People are like, "We agree.

721
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,000
 We agree."

722
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,320
 Now, people still went to the cave.

723
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,640
 People still went to the cave to see

724
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,360
 if they were brave enough to handle it.

725
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,280
 Like, you would have young warriors go up there,

726
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,960
 be like, "No, I can go in the cave."

727
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
 And they'll be like, "No, don't, don't."

728
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,920
 And then people would come back, be like,

729
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,200
 "Dude, you went in the cave."

730
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
 And everyone's like, "Don't go to the cave.

731
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,480
 Don't go to the cave."

732
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
 So people were still trying to do this,

733
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
 and you kept having these people disappear in the cave,

734
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,160
 and you kept hearing the death song.

735
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,200
 Several months later in the Winnebago tribe,

736
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
 this dude shows up with this 10-year-old boy.

737
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,640
 It's particular for two reasons.

738
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,040
 One, the dude is a white guy.

739
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,280
 This story takes place long before Columbus,

740
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,520
 long before pilgrims, long before settlers,

741
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,560
 anything like that.

742
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,080
 He's described as having pale skin and a long white beard.

743
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
 And in Native American blood,

744
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
 they don't really grow beards.

745
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,640
 Genetic fluke, they don't really have facial hair.

746
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 This white guy shows up, the long white beard,

747
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,920
 and he's blind.

748
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 The term actually that they use in the story is "utterly blind,"

749
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,200
 which again, the guy who wrote this, Richard...

750
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,040
 I can't pronounce your last name.

751
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,920
 Dude, sorry.

752
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,960
 But Richard says,

753
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,240
 "When the term 'utterly blind' is used in this context,

754
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
 it means not only is he physically blind,

755
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,800
 but he has mystical sight.

756
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
 You're not just blind, which can happen through an injury

757
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
 or something like that, eating too many mushrooms.

758
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
 He's so blind, he can see through the veil."

759
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,280
 And the tribe people automatically,

760
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,440
 like they can recognize this power in him.

761
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
 The other interesting thing was the 10-year-old boy

762
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,760
 is a Native boy from another tribe.

763
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,040
 He goes, "I'm from another tribe.

764
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,560
 This dude doesn't speak your language,

765
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,640
 but I do, and we're going to hang out here for a while."

766
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
 And the tribe's like, "Yeah, sure.

767
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
 This episode's going long.

768
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,920
 I hope you guys don't mind.

769
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,120
 I found this story fascinating."

770
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,760
 One of the women of the village, though,

771
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,800
 sees the 10-year-old boy and goes, "Johnny!"

772
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
 Or whatever his name was, right?

773
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,320
 Everyone's like, "Why? Who's Johnny?"

774
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
 She's like, "He is."

775
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,040
 She runs out to the boy.

776
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,480
 Her son was one of the first kids who went missing in the cave.

777
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,800
 One of the two deer hunters who went looking for the deer

778
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
 and then disappeared.

779
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,440
 The one that set off this whole thing.

780
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,000
 That was him.

781
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,160
 She goes, "You're back.

782
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,440
 You're back.

783
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
 After all this time, you're back.

784
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,280
 You're back."

785
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,160
 And the kid goes, "I don't know who you're talking about.

786
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,960
 I'm not him.

787
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,160
 I'm not him.

788
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,120
 I'm from another tribe.

789
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
 Back off, lady."

790
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
 Great Eagle is watching all this stuff,

791
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
 and he's like, "Okay, that's a little weird, right?"

792
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,080
 "Does kind of look like that kid who went missing."

793
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
 And the mom swears it's her son.

794
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,240
 But let's table that for a second.

795
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,400
 Let's table that weird thing for a second.

796
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,320
 I want to talk to this white dude."

797
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
 They begin talking, and this man, this stranger,

798
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
 again, he has this translator,

799
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,760
 because they say he speaks an unknown tongue.

800
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,400
 It's almost immediate they can tell

801
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,720
 that this guy has some sort of mystical power.

802
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,040
 So he is invited to stay into the village,

803
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,520
 and he is now known as Great Healer.

804
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
 And he's able to heal people.

805
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,280
 Probably perform a couple of tricks, too.

806
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,000
 Probably juggler.

807
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,400
 I don't know.

808
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,320
 That'd be kind of impressive, a blind juggler.

809
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,040
 The whole time, the mom's like, "That's a great trick,

810
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,880
 but please give me my son back."

811
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
 And the guy's just bowing, and the kid,

812
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,160
 his eyes are going side to side.

813
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,040
 "I'm not your son."

814
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,360
 But anyways, that's a subplot.

815
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,160
 And you wonder why these episodes go along sometimes.

816
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,560
 So anyways, eventually one day,

817
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,320
 Great Eagle's hanging out with Great Healer,

818
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,560
 and he goes, "I've never told you about the cave,

819
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,040
 have I?"

820
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,480
 And Great Healer's like, "What cave?"

821
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
 And he's like, "Oh, dude, you won't believe this.

822
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,000
 You want to know why that woman keeps stalking your interpreter?"

823
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,760
 He's like, "Yeah, I did think that was kind of weird.

824
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,360
 I'm blind, but I'm not that blind."

825
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,200
 That woman makes a lot of noise

826
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,760
 when she's trying to kidnap my interpreter.

827
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
 He goes, "So here's the story."

828
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,800
 And so Great Eagle tells Great Healer the whole story.

829
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
 A couple kids went missing,

830
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,160
 and then all these braves went missing, and so on and so on.

831
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,200
 And Great Healer does what any of us would do, right?

832
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,320
 He'd say, "Take me to that cave.

833
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,360
 I want to go to that cave."

834
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,800
 Because obviously, if you heard about it,

835
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,480
 you would want to go to this cave.

836
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,120
 Great Healer, Great Eagle,

837
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,960
 bunch of dudes, right?

838
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
 They're not going alone.

839
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
 March through the forest.

840
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,080
 They said they moved through the forest like a semi-circle,

841
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,840
 just protecting these two.

842
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
 They all get to this cave.

843
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,920
 So Great Eagle's there, all the warriors are there.

844
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,000
 Great Healer's there with his translator.

845
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,840
 And Great Eagle goes, "Yeah, there is the cave.

846
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
 Anyone who walks into it disappears."

847
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,560
 And then we hear this song, the death song,

848
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,600
 and which I think is actually a song of Marilyn Manson

849
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
 that I know that I think about it.

850
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,400
 It's actually a really good song,

851
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
 but that's not the song they're hearing.

852
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,040
 Maybe it was.

853
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,600
 Great Eagle, Great Healer, Translator, all the people.

854
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,960
 He's telling Great Healer this,

855
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,760
 and Great Healer goes, "I'm going to go check this cave out,

856
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,800
 because I'm not afraid to know ghosts."

857
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,960
 And the translator's probably like, "Uh,

858
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
 try not a good idea, bro."

859
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,760
 But he goes into the cave, but he doesn't go alone.

860
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,320
 He takes the 10-year-old boy with him.

861
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,720
 So they go into the cave, and Great Eagle's like,

862
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
 "Oh man, I really like that guy.

863
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
 Plus he goes to me like 20 bucks, saying he doesn't die.

864
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
 I hope he's not Barry part 2."

865
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
 And as Great Healer and the boy enter the cave,

866
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,840
 they hear the death song start, and they're like,

867
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,280
 "Oh no."

868
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,480
 And Great Eagle's like, "Dang it,

869
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
 I'm going to stop telling people about this cave.

870
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,040
 No more.

871
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
 I'm not going to do this."

872
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,800
 But then the death song gets louder.

873
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,480
 Louder than they've ever heard it before.

874
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
 The warriors are kind of looking at each other nervously.

875
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,360
 Great Eagle's looking around.

876
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,080
 He's like, "Uh-oh."

877
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,640
 This is not normal.

878
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,320
 Normally caves that devour people's souls and sing.

879
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,400
 Don't get this loud.

880
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,800
 All that other stuff's normal, but this is weird.

881
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,520
 The song gets so loud.

882
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,640
 The trees start to sway to the rhythm.

883
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,560
 And everyone's just waiting for something super bad to happen.

884
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,720
 And then utter silence.

885
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:28,400
 Not a sound can be heard, except footsteps.

886
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:36,080
 And out of that cave walks Great Healer.

887
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,840
 Alone, by the way.

888
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
 He is alone.

889
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,240
 Great Healer walks out of that cave with a peaceful smile on his face.

890
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,280
 He looks up at the sun.

891
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,640
 He's blind, so he can do that.

892
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,400
 He looks up at the sun with this serene smile on his face,

893
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,040
 and the sunlight just kind of brushes across the skin.

894
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:02,560
 He then begins to sing the death song himself in a language nobody can understand.

895
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,960
 He walks past Great Eagle.

896
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
 He walks past the warriors.

897
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,560
 He begins walking down to a river where there's a canoe sitting on the shore.

898
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,920
 Everyone's like, "What? What is going on here?"

899
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,800
 Great Healer gets in the canoe standing straight up,

900
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,120
 and the canoe launches itself off the shore,

901
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,000
 and without any oars just begins floating down the river.

902
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,280
 Dude just standing up the whole time.

903
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,240
 And all the warriors and Great Eagle are just watching this dude perfectly pilot a canoe.

904
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,760
 Standing up.

905
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,520
 No paddles.

906
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
 And it just goes around the riverbind.

907
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,400
 They never saw him again.

908
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,600
 And Great Eagle's like, "Okay, that's great. Mystery solved, right?

909
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
 Let's just all go home and be brilliant.

910
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
 Don't you want to see what's on the get?"

911
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,640
 Nope.

912
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,280
 Nope.

913
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,640
 I've not lost all curiosity in the cave.

914
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,160
 I got floating boats.

915
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,240
 I got another missing 10-year-old kid.

916
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
 You, you're gonna have to be brave enough to tell his mom what happened to him again.

917
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
 I'm done.

918
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,760
 I'm done with this cave.

919
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,040
 But of course, people are so curious.

920
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,240
 You're curious about this cave.

921
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,760
 I'm curious about this cave.

922
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
 We don't even know where it is, or do we?

923
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
 This is a long episode.

924
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,960
 A couple days later, one of the braves in the village was like,

925
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,240
 "Dude, I'm going into that cave."

926
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,920
 And people were like, "Come on, man!

927
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
 We've lost so many people in that cave.

928
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,480
 I'm going in that cave.

929
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,120
 I'm going in the cave."

930
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,280
 So he's able to rustle up a couple of his friends.

931
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,560
 They head out there.

932
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,880
 At this point, it's basically a tourist trap, right?

933
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,200
 Everyone in the village knows who this thing is.

934
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
 He goes out there.

935
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,160
 He walks into the cave.

936
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
 And the two friends are like, "Dude, why did we get suckered in?

937
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,080
 Coming out of here, we're gonna have to walk all the way back."

938
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
 It's totally lame.

939
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,320
 Friend walks out of the cave.

940
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, dude.

941
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
 Just a cave in there.

942
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,120
 Not spooky at all."

943
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,800
 And people are like, "What in the world?

944
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,440
 What just happened?"

945
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,960
 He goes, "Listen, I'll tell you what happened.

946
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,400
 I walked to the cave.

947
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,600
 Nothing creepy happened.

948
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,640
 There's no cliff.

949
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,520
 Walked to the cave.

950
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,160
 Then I got to a point where the ceiling's so low,

951
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,200
 you have to crawl.

952
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,640
 And I didn't want to do that.

953
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,720
 That was a little too much for me, right?

954
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,800
 But if you want to come in the cave with me,

955
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,680
 well, check it out."

956
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,080
 Now, this was the first person other than Great Healer

957
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
 who walked out of the cave.

958
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 And that dude went nuts, right?

959
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
 Well, he went nuts and was magical.

960
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,960
 And his partner disappeared.

961
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
 His interpreter disappeared.

962
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,640
 But this was the first time someone's walked in and out of the cave.

963
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
 And there hasn't even been a death song played.

964
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,960
 So the warrior goes in and is able to convince one of his buddies to go in.

965
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,720
 And they reach the end of the cave.

966
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
 And it just comes into this little tunnel.

967
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
 They got to get down on their hands and knees.

968
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,480
 And they're crawling in the darkness.

969
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,120
 What they enter into is a massive chamber.

970
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:51,840
 It's basically a giant room carved into the mountain.

971
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,880
 They see a throne carved into one of the walls.

972
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,280
 And all across the floor were hundreds of skeletons

973
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:11,440
 laying face down, arms spread wide out, hundreds of them.

974
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,160
 The two warriors ran out.

975
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,440
 They go back to the village.

976
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,320
 They tell Great Eagle.

977
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,600
 And Great Eagle then goes, "Listen, let's just seal the cave."

978
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,280
 Because obviously, if you are going to keep going in there,

979
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
 I don't even want to know what's in there.

980
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
 He said he thinks it's probably the homeless and Great Spirit.

981
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
 It must be the rest.

982
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,280
 Whatever.

983
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,840
 He probably has even done guessing.

984
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,360
 He's holding a photo of Barry.

985
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
 He's like, "Oh, man.

986
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,560
 No more berries."

987
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,000
 So they actually hide the entrance to the cave.

988
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,840
 Now, that legend had been around in Wisconsin for years.

989
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,880
 It was considered local Native American lore.

990
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 But in the 1920s, I believe, 1920s,

991
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,160
 there was someone from Wisconsin who was reading a newspaper from Austria,

992
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,360
 from Vienna, Austria.

993
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,040
 This newspaper was called The Courier.

994
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,920
 You had someone from Wisconsin reading this newspaper from 1891.

995
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,360
 So they were reading like a 30-year-old newspaper.

996
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,400
 And they came across the story of an Austrian who visited Wisconsin.

997
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
 Again, this had been a legend.

998
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,280
 People thought that this was one of many, many legends of great ghost stories,

999
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,680
 of great battles that may or may not be true.

1000
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,640
 And you would never know, really, if there was any facts to it.

1001
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,960
 But in the 1920s, someone from Wisconsin found this article in The Courier.

1002
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,440
 And it tells the story of an Austrian scientist whose friend Paul Seyfert

1003
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,160
 lived in Wisconsin and began sending him back artifacts from American aborigines.

1004
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,520
 So he was so curious.

1005
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,160
 He traveled out to Richland City to meet his friend Paul Seyfert.

1006
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,800
 And he goes, "Paul, you got to show me where this stuff is at."

1007
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,240
 And he's like, "Fine."

1008
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,960
 And he's more than happy to show his old friend where he'd found these things.

1009
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,160
 Paul Seyfert leads Arnold to a cave.

1010
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,000
 They walk into the cave.

1011
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,840
 The ceiling gets low.

1012
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,680
 And then they enter a room.

1013
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,000
 Here's a direct quote from that article.

1014
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,120
 "Darkness and damp air surrounded us.

1015
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,520
 Paul lit another torch.

1016
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,560
 I cannot describe the horror I felt.

1017
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,440
 The bottom of the cave was covered with skeletons of a vanished race.

1018
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,600
 Skulls were everywhere.

1019
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,080
 Here perished the tribe, very near, I could say, a nation.

1020
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,360
 Their belongings were scattered among the bones.

1021
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,480
 Battle axes of stone, ancient pottery, hole, and in fragments.

1022
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,160
 Flint arrows and spears, hole and broken, everywhere."

1023
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,520
 He eventually starts panicking.

1024
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,840
 As most people would, Paul seems to be very okay with this whole thing.

1025
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,560
 And at a certain point, Arnold describes the sound of a howling.

1026
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
 He said it sounded like maniacs all around him.

1027
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,600
 He said it sounded like, quote, "the moans of the dying under torture."

1028
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,960
 And Paul goes, "Oh no, no, that's just the sound of the air coming through the tunnel

1029
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,280
 and the water dripping through the cave."

1030
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
 Maybe, right?

1031
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,640
 That's reasonable, right?

1032
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,720
 But, okay, in a vacuum, sure.

1033
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,760
 But when you're in an ancient throne room surrounded by a nation's worth of skeletons,

1034
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,080
 you might want to think it might be supernatural.

1035
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,560
 But Arnold's like, "Dude, dude, we gotta get out of there."

1036
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
 Eventually, Arnold says he starts to see blue flashes of light all around him.

1037
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,320
 And finally, Paul's like, "Yeah, yeah, sure.

1038
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,120
 I've just created this grave enough for whatever this place is."

1039
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,280
 He leads Arnold out.

1040
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,520
 Now Arnold returns to Austria, probably the first plane out of there.

1041
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,400
 Planes weren't invented.

1042
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,360
 He invents the planes.

1043
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,400
 Like, hurry up, hurry up.

1044
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,640
 Gotta invent aerodynamics real quick.

1045
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,360
 Goose are chasing him.

1046
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,000
 He's like, "Ahh."

1047
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,240
 He takes a steamer.

1048
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
 Probably, he takes a boat back to Vienna.

1049
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
 He tells a story over there.

1050
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,360
 So you have this story of this cave that pretty much matches, right?

1051
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,320
 You have the cave room.

1052
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,280
 You have all the skeletons.

1053
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,520
 In two completely different geographical locations,

1054
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,440
 long before the internet, long before you would have these rumors kind of floating

1055
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,560
 around that you could build off of.

1056
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,440
 Ancient stories connected, but separated by an ocean.

1057
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
 So where is the cave?

1058
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,680
 It probably exists, because we have two stories that really verify it.

1059
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,520
 We have this ancient legend, then we have some dude coming to visit America.

1060
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
 And someone's like, "Hey, man, glad to see you.

1061
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,760
 Let's go to my ancient throne room."

1062
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,920
 Paul Seyfert knows where it's at.

1063
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,080
 He was obviously able to go back there enough to pilfer these items,

1064
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,040
 send them overseas and stuff like that.

1065
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,160
 He made multiple trips.

1066
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
 He actually told the State Historical Society, because again, this was a,

1067
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,720
 it probably wasn't the most well-known story in the area, but people knew about it.

1068
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,560
 He went to the State Historical Society, he goes, "Oh yeah, you know that cave

1069
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,640
 that was eating all those people up and stuff like that?

1070
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,800
 I know where that's at, but I'm not going to tell you."

1071
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,200
 They're like, "Why would you even come to our meeting to say that?"

1072
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
 He's like, "I don't know. I just wanted to."

1073
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,840
 He said, he goes, "Listen, I actually planted a bunch of foliage,

1074
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,720
 plant a bunch of bushes and stuff in front of the mouth of the cave,

1075
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,480
 so no one will ever find it."

1076
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,120
 And probably thinking, "Well, okay, we'll just start looking for giant holes behind bushes."

1077
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,040
 And he's like, "Yeah, that's probably true."

1078
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,480
 One of Paul's neighbors one day was actually just hanging out and he hears a "pah-pah!"

1079
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,560
 He's like, "What? Intarnation is that?"

1080
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,600
 And he gets out of his bed and he starts walking away.

1081
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:32,640
 Here's the sound and he sees up on this ridge, Paul, standing there and he's like,

1082
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,080
 "Hey, sorry to wake you up with my dynamite. Sorry, dude.

1083
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,960
 What are you doing up there?"

1084
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,280
 He's like, "Oh, there's like this hole.

1085
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,400
 There's this hole that I'm afraid that kids might fall into,

1086
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,240
 so I'm going to seal it with dynamite."

1087
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,800
 "Well, I'd probably just buy a giant cork or get a sign or something like that."

1088
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
 Paul's like, "This is way more fun."

1089
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,880
 And based on where he was exploding the stuff,

1090
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,160
 the neighbor said that must be where the mine is, right?

1091
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,360
 It wasn't right outside his house.

1092
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,880
 It was an explosion that was heard for quite a while.

1093
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
 The guy was like, "Well, golly, Paul!"

1094
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,640
 Then Paul jumps off the ridge and just walks home and his house is right there.

1095
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,680
 You'd have to go into the wilderness to find this thing.

1096
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,160
 But he goes, "I know where Paul was blowing stuff up, so let's go out there."

1097
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,520
 So they actually had treasure hunters back in the 20s.

1098
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
 Again, when this story came out, this Austrian story came out,

1099
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,520
 they kind of verified this thing.

1100
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,520
 You had people go out there and looking for it and the guy's like, "Oh, I was over there."

1101
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,560
 They're out there, they never found the cave.

1102
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,840
 Even where he was blowing stuff up at, they never ever found the cave.

1103
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,400
 So what does that mean?

1104
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,800
 I'm giving myself like one minute to wrap this up because this episode's gone on really long.

1105
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,480
 But what does that mean?

1106
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,160
 That means that this cave is one, probably real.

1107
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,800
 And two, if it is real, it's still out there.

1108
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,640
 If you live in Wisconsin or if you can travel, if you're not currently incarcerated,

1109
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,360
 if you can get to Wisconsin, you may be able to find this cave.

1110
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,160
 Now, the last report we have of someone being in it was the dude from Austria.

1111
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,640
 And he did say that he heard the sounds of a maniac,

1112
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,400
 that he heard these horrible noises, the sounds of the tortured and stuff.

1113
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,440
 So does it still have some paranormal aspect or was it just normal stuff going on?

1114
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,880
 That because he was already in a heightened state of anxiety,

1115
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,120
 i.e. being surrounded by hundreds of skeletons in a spooky cave,

1116
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,240
 was making him hear things and see things that weren't really there.

1117
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,200
 But this cave most likely still exists.

1118
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,160
 And you could find it.

1119
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,720
 But if you found it, would you enter that cave?

1120
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,720
 Knowing that whatever curse it once had may have been cured by the Great Healer.

1121
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,120
 Or would you leave it alone?

1122
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,400
 Let it be a relic for a time that has been long forgotten.

1123
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,160
 Because whoever built that throne room, it wasn't the Winnebago tribe.

1124
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:10,560
 That cave was carved out by something far older than the Native American tribes.

1125
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:18,880
 A race, maybe even a species, that were the first ones to reach Wisconsin.
