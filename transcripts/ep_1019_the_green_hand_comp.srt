1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 When a woman drives through her husband's workplace to pick him up, she has no idea

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,000
 she's about to be thrust into a world of international intrigue.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,880
 And then we travel to a young boy's bedroom to meet a little three-year-old fella trying

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,400
 to get some sleep.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,880
 However, it is hard to relax when you're being attacked by the green pan.

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,880
 Stay on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:43,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,240
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,740
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,720
 There's actually some weird free snap going on up here.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,160
 I'm wearing a jacket and two sweaters.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,920
 I mean, I'm quite miserable if I may be honest.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,720
 But someone who always makes it so I'm not super miserable, walking into Dead Rabbit

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,760
 Command right now, get your mouths open and ready to take a bite of our newest Patreon

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
 supporter, Moist Cheez-Itz.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 Yeah!

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 Come on in!

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
 Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
 Now I'm gonna eat you up.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,960
 No, actually that's a disgusting combination.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,760
 Cheez-Itz are good.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
 But Moist ones are pretty gross.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,280
 But there's no insult against you, sir.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,440
 I totally understand.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 Just helps.

30
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
 So cold.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,720
 Just helps spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 That helps out so much.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,080
 My hands are in my pockets.

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,520
 My God, it's freezing.

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,600
 Moist Cheez-Itz, what's the warmest vehicle?

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,160
 Moist Cheez-Itz, I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys to the rabbit rocket ship.

37
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,920
 I'm gonna be underneath the afterburner.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
 Take us up, up and away.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,040
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,640
 Fly us all the way out to Alberta, Canada.

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,160
 Flying around in the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship.

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,560
 We're headed out to Alberta, Canada, I think.

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,280
 I was going through this personals profile to see if I could figure out exactly where

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 this took place.

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,200
 A couple other people who were reading this story, they zeroed in Alberta, Canada.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,680
 But it's really a major city if it's not specifically Alberta.

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,800
 The person who posted this.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,640
 Their online profile is absz33rd.

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,360
 Absz said that this story takes place in a major city up in Canada.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,320
 But absz is a third party to this.

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,040
 So they're actually not part of the narrative.

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
 What we're gonna do is we're gonna look at the story of a woman named Sherry.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,040
 These aren't their real names, but these are the names we'll use.

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,760
 Sherry, she's married to a man named John.

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,680
 Now John's in his 50s and for the past six years, they've been married.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,200
 Sherry and John have been married.

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,400
 And when they got into this relationship, John had two adult children.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,280
 They were both daughters and they were in their 30s.

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,520
 So he has these two adult daughters.

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,360
 John meets Sherry, they fall in love, they get married.

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,600
 And both of his daughters marry as well.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,560
 They have this big extended family.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,880
 And you know, the family wondered, they thought it was odd that the daughters did not have

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
 children themselves.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
 Like now they're in this new relationship and they're not talking about having kids.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
 Now listen, that is a total personal decision.

67
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,960
 I know a lot of people who don't have kids for a variety of reasons, right?

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,800
 But you know, families talk.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,520
 Sherry is not a business.

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,680
 Those are her daughters, her stepdaughters, but you know, she's not really sweating it

71
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
 too much.

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,320
 She's happily in love with John.

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,520
 She loves her stepkids.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
 Everything's going great.

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,080
 Well, everything was going great for the past six years.

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,760
 But our story really starts Christmas 2022.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,200
 And that's when John starts acting a little weird.

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,720
 He was always just kind of a normal secular kind of guy.

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,480
 He never seemed overly religious.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,840
 But when Christmas rolls around, he starts acting weird.

81
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,480
 All of a sudden, he refuses.

82
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,480
 Okay, well here's the thing, I'm not trying to insult any religions, right?

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,080
 I'm like, this guy turned out to be a big whackadoodle.

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,880
 He started believing in a particular religion.

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,000
 Not saying that.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,960
 But around Christmas 2022, all of a sudden, things change.

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 John changes.

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,560
 He begins to refuse to work on Saturdays.

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,120
 He says Saturdays are a day of rest.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 He won't cook.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
 He won't do any cooking.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
 He won't do any chores.

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,640
 He just can do nothing on Saturdays.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,520
 Which a lot of times, I know that that is like Orthodox Jews.

95
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
 That's one of their things.

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
 They don't work at all on Saturday.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,640
 That's the Sabbath in the Jewish faith.

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,520
 So you can't, there are all of these restrictions to what they can do on Saturdays.

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
 You're not supposed to do anything really.

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,040
 It's like, I think anything that's more than a press of a button is considered work.

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,960
 I'm not saying that that's a weird religious belief.

102
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
 I don't care about that.

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
 What's weird is that he went from zero to 60.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 This guy was a secular.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,920
 He might have said he was Ben Acosta or something like that.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,840
 He might have held a religious belief like a lot of people do.

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,240
 And then they just go to church on Christmas and Easter.

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,720
 But he went from zero to 60.

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,440
 All of a sudden, he's like hardcore, "I do not work on the Sabbath."

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,480
 And he didn't come out and say, "I'm Jewish now."

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,080
 He didn't convert or anything like that.

112
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,200
 He made, who knows why he's doing this?

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,720
 Who knows why he's deciding not to work on Saturdays?

114
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,320
 Like millions of other people, again, I'm not saying that that's crazy.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:17,040
 I'm saying that to go, it's crazy to have zero religious restrictions to all of a sudden all of them.

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,540
 Right?

117
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,080
 Okay, you guys are gonna agree with me on that.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
 He goes, all of a sudden he stops working on Saturdays.

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
 No cooking, no chores.

120
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
 He can only relax.

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:36,000
 And he immediately stops celebrating Christmas.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
 He's like, "No more Christmas for me."

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
 And again, fine, whatever.

124
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,360
 But he also made it super miserable for everybody else.

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,240
 He's all kicking the Christmas tree over.

126
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
 He's smashing ornaments in the middle of the night right outside the bathroom door.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,360
 So when you wake up to go to the bathroom, you step on broken glass.

128
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,080
 I don't know if he actually became antagonistic towards Christmas.

129
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,960
 But he basically stopped celebrating it.

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,640
 And again, from zero to 60.

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,760
 The six or five previous Christmases this family spent together, they'd been together for six years.

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,960
 Now all of a sudden he doesn't celebrate it anymore.

133
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,840
 Now let's fast forward to January 6th, 2023.

134
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
 Sherry gets off work.

135
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,760
 And she sees John's car waiting for her in the parking lot.

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
 This is normal.

137
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
 I mean, that sounds super suspicious.

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,360
 That long pause.

139
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
 I'm all done, done, done.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
 She, that's normal.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,760
 That's totally normal.

142
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
 He normally picks her up after work.

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,960
 She's like, "Oh, this is normal."

144
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,120
 And so she walked out to the car and she hops in.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
 "Hey John."

146
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,000
 And John's sitting there in the car in the driver's seat.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,800
 And he has this binder on his lap.

148
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,440
 And he hands this binder to Sherry and goes, "In this binder is divorce papers.

149
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
 They've all been filled out by a lawyer.

150
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,520
 All you need to do is sign them and we are now legally divorced.

151
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
 Sign them."

152
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,240
 She's like, "What?"

153
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,920
 He's like, "I'm leaving you.

154
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,880
 Our marriage is over.

155
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,120
 I need you to sign these documents.

156
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,920
 Here's a pen.

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,520
 You need to sign them.

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,160
 Sign these documents."

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,880
 And she's obviously totally taken aback by this.

160
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,560
 She's like, "Is this because of Christmas?

161
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
 Is this because you didn't want Christmas?"

162
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,560
 He goes, "Just sign the paperwork.

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,240
 We are getting a divorce.

164
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
 I am leaving you.

165
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,520
 Sign the papers.

166
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,160
 It's over."

167
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,440
 And she's so taken off guard and he's putting so much pressure on her

168
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,560
 because he's like, "You got to sign them.

169
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,280
 Sign them.

170
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,680
 Sign them."

171
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,800
 He's pressuring her into signing the papers.

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,120
 He's playing Ace of Bases.

173
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,640
 It's the song I saw the sign.

174
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
 He's like, "Sign.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,240
 Sign.

176
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,480
 Sign."

177
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
 She's like, "Okay, okay.

178
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
 Okay.

179
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,760
 I'll sign them."

180
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,280
 Like, she totally doesn't know what else to do.

181
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
 She's in shock.

182
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,800
 And she signs the paperwork in the binder and then John,

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
 once he sees that everything's signed,

184
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,440
 John gets out of the car and just walks away.

185
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,800
 And she's sitting there in the car and she's watching her husband of six years just leave.

186
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,640
 And she has this binder in her lap and she shuts off the Ace of Bases song and she goes,

187
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,760
 "What in the world just happened?"

188
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,120
 Like, I can't believe this.

189
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,280
 And she realizes that the keys are left in the car.

190
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,680
 So, I mean, obviously he wasn't planning on coming back.

191
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,560
 Keys are in the car and he also left his cell phone.

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,880
 She's like, "What in the world?"

193
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,800
 Like, you would think it was a prank.

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,880
 You would think it was a very famous honey we're getting a fake divorce prank that's so popular in TikTok.

195
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,360
 He left the keys in the car.

196
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,720
 He left his phone and she drives home.

197
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,440
 She still has no idea what's going on.

198
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,560
 Later on, she's looking through the paperwork that she signed.

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,320
 And John left her everything.

200
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,320
 The house is hers now.

201
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,240
 The car is hers now.

202
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,400
 But it also, the paperwork also was John giving her his motorcycles.

203
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,520
 He had these motorcycles that he had bought that were his.

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,000
 He was the only one ever used them, apparently.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,120
 They're now hers.

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,800
 Everything that he owned now belonged to her.

207
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,080
 And she's like, "What in the world could have possibly happened?

208
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,960
 She doesn't get it."

209
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,360
 But it is these are legal documents showing that everything, she owns everything now.

210
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,040
 Like, it's a final divorce and he's not going to fight her for anything.

211
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,440
 And then she finds out, like probably in a day or two, she finds out that

212
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,360
 both of her stepdaughters on that same day presented their husbands with a binder.

213
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,520
 These are divorce papers.

214
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
 They've already been signed by a lawyer.

215
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,160
 You need to sign here.

216
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,880
 I'm leaving you.

217
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,320
 And all three of them have never been seen since.

218
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,800
 John and the two adult daughters on the same day divorced their spouses,

219
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,680
 left their spouses with everything and completely vanished.

220
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:53,720
 Obviously, this sounds like some sort of spiring or some sort of cell, right?

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,200
 Some sort of sleeper cell in Canada.

222
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,080
 And they got their assignment changed.

223
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,960
 They had to leave.

224
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,880
 It's funny, a lot of people are like, because when abs posted this,

225
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,960
 a lot of people are like, "Ah, that sounds like the plot of the Black Widow movie from Marvel Studios."

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,640
 Yeah, the reason why it seemed like the Black Widow movie, because the Black Widow movie

227
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,840
 was based on really bad smell, that there's actually a Black Widow running around.

228
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
 Not that Iron Man's real.

229
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,000
 But the beginning of Black Widow, you find out that she was part of this Russian sleeper cell

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,800
 when she was like 13 years old that was in the United States and they get compromised and

231
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,080
 they have to flee.

232
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,680
 I actually like the Black Widow movie and I don't watch a lot of the Marvel stuff anymore.

233
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 I did enjoy Black Widow.

234
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,600
 They do this.

235
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,400
 They have these sleeper cells out there and they will become unnoticeable, right?

236
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,560
 They want to blend in as much as possible.

237
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,360
 But we don't know.

238
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:59,960
 This story was updated for a couple of days, but again, abs is kind of a secondary character

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,600
 to all of this.

240
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,960
 Abs just knows this story.

241
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,760
 Let me find the actual relationship here real quick.

242
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,040
 I think they're just friends.

243
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,080
 Yeah, so a close friend, they, they, abs starts off by saying a close friend just had a very

244
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,400
 weird event take place in his family and we, his friends, are trying to figure out what happened.

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 My friend has an aunt.

246
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,960
 So we have basically third or really a fourth place character in this.

247
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,280
 This type of stuff does happen.

248
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,560
 There's actually a big controversy.

249
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,320
 I'll put the article in the show notes.

250
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,680
 I thought about covering it on the show.

251
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,960
 I've just never gotten around to it.

252
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:43,080
 In Britain, there, there's huge lawsuit because you had an environmental group.

253
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,640
 Environmental groups are always infiltrated by government forces.

254
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,760
 It's super weird.

255
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 You think they're just out there planting daisies and telling people, you know, don't use cars,

256
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,280
 you know, watch your oil people, you know, peak oil, all that stuff.

257
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,760
 A lot of them are like that.

258
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,800
 Other ones are blowing up, blowing up construction sites and putting spikes in trees.

259
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,080
 So when you try to chainsaw them down, your chainsaw breaks at the least that the most

260
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,720
 the chainsaw breaks and then kills the person using it.

261
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,480
 But what it's so interesting, whether or not they're kind of like the peace hippie kind of like

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,440
 climate change, climate change is bad or how much for these explosives good sir.

263
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,240
 I'm going to destroy this Dow chemical plant.

264
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,800
 The government always infiltrates environmental groups.

265
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,000
 It's super weird.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,120
 The government hates them.

267
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,680
 Always keeping tabs on them.

268
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,640
 There was a big, the big brew ha ha.

269
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
 It was probably about 20 years ago now.

270
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,880
 I'll put the article in the show notes, but you had a police investigator go undercover

271
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:55,640
 into an environmental organization and for his cover to be effective to totally blend in,

272
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,680
 he ended up marrying one of the members of the environmental group and getting her pregnant.

273
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,240
 And then when his assignment was over, he just disappeared.

274
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,040
 Like, the woman's like, oh, where's the father of my baby?

275
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,200
 We were together for a couple of years.

276
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
 We have this baby.

277
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,720
 And then if I remember correctly, he started another undercover assignment and someone put

278
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,880
 two and two together and found out he worked for the police and they sued.

279
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,320
 They go, you can't go around having babies with people just to not blow your cover.

280
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,720
 Like that's immoral.

281
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,880
 The very least it should be illegal.

282
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,200
 But yeah, there was a big expose.

283
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,880
 I think the Guardian did a big write up on it.

284
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,920
 It was like 20 years ago.

285
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,760
 I'll put that article in the show notes.

286
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,920
 But so this type of stuff does happen.

287
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,000
 You have people of these organizations, right?

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,760
 Spy organizations, if we're lucky, right?

289
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,440
 The other thing is that if it was a group of terrorists, see the dad and the daughters are

290
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,520
 most likely not related at all.

291
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,720
 They move as a unit and they were in this area, this major Canadian city, maybe Alberta,

292
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,240
 for a period of what were they doing there?

293
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,840
 Were they surveilling stuff?

294
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,800
 Like it's crazy.

295
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,520
 It's absolutely crazy story.

296
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,040
 And this is how they work.

297
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,400
 This is how these groups work.

298
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,720
 It's interesting because pre-internet, you could get away with a bunch of this stuff.

299
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,520
 It'd be much easier to just pop in and out of communities because it would just be a mystery

300
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
 in that community.

301
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,960
 It really just be a mystery in that family.

302
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,760
 But nowadays someone can go, "Hey, hey internet, here's a weird one for you.

303
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,960
 Be on the lookout for a man and his two 30-year-old daughters moving into your city."

304
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,120
 The police officer being caught with having the baby, you're able to match stuff against

305
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,560
 Facebook photos.

306
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,920
 You have a protest here with a bunch of people in it and then you have a protest here

307
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,280
 with a bunch of people in it and you're like, "Hey, that's my missing husband and the father

308
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,560
 of my child in both of these environmental protest groups."

309
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,440
 Absolutely fascinating.

310
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,400
 And a mystery too.

311
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,120
 People have said, "Well, I don't think divorce papers, you just can have a lawyer.

312
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,440
 I don't think a lawyer can pre-fill stuff out and bring it in."

313
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,200
 People have questioned some of the legal moves, but really at the end of the day,

314
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,440
 because the person kept updating this and they're like, "Listen,

315
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,360
 and I'm just a friend of the nephew of this story."

316
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,320
 But if someone did fill out paperwork saying, "You own everything and I'm leaving you,"

317
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,720
 and they have that site illegally documented, then you could say, "Yeah, maybe the divorce

318
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,120
 isn't finalized, but they're gone."

319
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,680
 Like, what are you going to do?

320
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,880
 You can't serve them anyways.

321
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
 They're gone.

322
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,360
 That most likely wasn't his real name.

323
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,880
 Well, John definitely wasn't his real name.

324
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,520
 I made that up.

325
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,000
 But whatever name he gave to this family, most likely wasn't real.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
 The kids probably weren't his.

327
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,240
 They were this group that was moving around.

328
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,520
 It is weird too.

329
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,960
 Other people have said colt.

330
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
 Other people have said it was a colt.

331
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,240
 But colts generally, they want all your stuff.

332
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,640
 They don't want you to give your stuff to somebody else.

333
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,560
 People were thinking it was a colt because all of a sudden he did that weird switch

334
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,720
 where he wasn't celebrating Christmas anymore and he wouldn't work on Saturdays.

335
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,280
 But I don't know.

336
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,440
 They didn't say that the girls started acting like that.

337
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,440
 He could have been just doing that because he's like, "It's been a long assignment.

338
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,720
 I've been a spy for a long time and I'm moving on, so I'm finally going to take,"

339
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,040
 the agency gave him some time off, but they're like, "You can only take it off on Saturdays."

340
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,080
 He's like, "Yes, sir."

341
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,120
 I don't know.

342
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,520
 Or it could have had some religious significance.

343
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,240
 We don't know.

344
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,960
 Anyways, a real life mystery going on.

345
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
 If you do, so basically be on the lookout.

346
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,520
 I'm issuing a bullow for a man in his fifties.

347
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,400
 If you see a man in his fifties with two 30 year olds, stop them and say,

348
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,800
 "I heard about you on the spot.

349
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,320
 Can't don't do that because it's possible they just shoot you in the street."

350
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,200
 If these guys are spies, then they'll let nothing get in their way.

351
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,640
 Not even you.

352
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,600
 So don't do anything.

353
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,760
 If you happen to see these guys, just let them go.

354
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,200
 But again, what if they're terrorists?

355
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,320
 That it would be crazy.

356
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,480
 But I would recommend not trying to stop them unless you're a federal agent.

357
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,800
 Or I don't know, maybe you work for the London police and you've got a bunch of

358
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,920
 illegitimate children out there and then you could have your little army of baby ninjas.

359
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,760
 Well, geez, it's I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coffter.

360
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,920
 Let's say goodbye to Alberta, Canada.

361
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,200
 We got to shake these spies that are going to be after us because we just exposed actually

362
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,080
 not the thing about it.

363
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,960
 We did just expose a spy ring on a podcast.

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,360
 I don't know.

365
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,920
 No, they're definitely spies.

366
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
 There's no other thing that works.

367
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,880
 They were definitely spies.

368
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,840
 I don't think it was a cult.

369
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,040
 I don't think it was a coincidence.

370
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
 They're definitely working for someone.

371
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,520
 But Moise Cheez-Itz, we are headed out from Alberta.

372
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,640
 Play us all the way out to a little boys bedroom.

373
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:08,040
 I imagine if those guys were Masa, because I think a lot of people would think with the

374
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,560
 not working on Saturday.

375
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,600
 Actually, I wonder if the Masa, which is Israel's internal, they're basically their CIA,

376
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,240
 their spy group.

377
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,960
 I'm pretty sure they can work on Saturday.

378
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,280
 So I'm pretty sure that you wouldn't have a spy organization because there's like Orthodox Jews

379
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,680
 and they're the ones who are super strict with the Saturday thing, with the Sabbath.

380
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,480
 And then you have Reform Judaism.

381
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
 And then there's a third one.

382
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,880
 I'm not for sure what that one's called.

383
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,000
 Or maybe there's not a third one.

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,680
 But I imagine there are obviously like if you're engaged in a firefight or if you're trying,

385
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,800
 like the Israeli army, I'm sure they work on Saturdays.

386
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,240
 I don't think that it's the Masa necessarily, but who knows?

387
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,680
 Who knows what's going on with that story?

388
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,320
 Anyways, but anyways, we're in this little boy's bedroom.

389
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,200
 And I mean, when I say little boy, this kid is three years old.

390
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,480
 He didn't give his name.

391
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,160
 We're going to go ahead and call him Charlie.

392
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,600
 Online, he goes by the handle Confident Ruta Vega 23.

393
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,000
 But we're just going to call you Charlie.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,960
 Charlie is sleeping in his bedroom.

395
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,600
 He shares it with his older brother and they're in a bunk bed.

396
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,080
 And Charlie, because he's three, gets the bottom bunk.

397
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 Figure if you fall off a little bunk, you're just going to like smash your nose as opposed

398
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,040
 to permanent brain damage.

399
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,800
 He's sleeping on the bottom bunk and he wakes up.

400
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,000
 Because somebody is tapping on his hand.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,960
 Now his hand is kind of like outside of the covers, slightly hanging off the bed.

402
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,840
 And he feels this tap, tap, tapping on the flesh of the back of his hand.

403
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,160
 His parents, they left the hallway light on as sort of a nightlight.

404
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,800
 For these brothers, the whole light is on.

405
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:12,280
 It's letting in enough light into the bedroom that when Charlie looks over to see who is tapping

406
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:20,760
 on his hand, who at this point he is assuming his brother is playing a trick or maybe even

407
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,240
 his father, he can't really figure it out.

408
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,920
 But he looks over and in the light that's coming in from the hallway, he sees not who

409
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,880
 but what is tapping on his hand.

410
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:42,920
 He sees a large green hairy hand.

411
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,880
 This is interesting because there's so much stuff going on with this visual.

412
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,480
 I know I kind of threw all those adjectives at you, but let's break it down.

413
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,120
 He said the hand itself was covered in black hair.

414
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:05,320
 But through the black hair, you could see the skin of the hand was pea soup green.

415
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,080
 It's kind of that pale, watery green.

416
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,920
 You could see that through the black hair.

417
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:22,040
 And the hand also had short fingernails, but the fingernails were also green.

418
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,800
 And he could feel the skin of this green hairy hand.

419
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:36,280
 It felt very dry, very coarse skin touching his own.

420
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,640
 He begins to move his hand away from this green hairy hand reaching out from underneath his bed.

421
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:51,560
 And at that moment, the green hairy hand seemed to make what he described as the letter Y in

422
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:58,920
 American Sign Language, which to most of the world looks like the Chakabro,

423
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,800
 like the Hang 10 type of hand sign. Your pinkies extended and your thumbs extended out.

424
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,960
 He saw the hand kind of make that signal and for whatever reason,

425
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,160
 he wasn't seeing the hand that freaked him out.

426
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,720
 He wasn't the hand touching him that freaked him out.

427
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:22,760
 When the hand made that symbol, Charlie shoved his hand underneath his pillow and began screaming

428
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,800
 at the top of his lungs. It's almost like it took him that long to finally make the connection

429
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,920
 that what he was looking at wasn't... It shouldn't exist. It definitely shouldn't exist under your bed.

430
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,000
 Charlie begins screaming. The parents run in.

431
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,280
 Charlie, this little three-year-old boy starts going, "It's a green hand and he's reaching up

432
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:50,440
 and he's touching me." And then he makes the Y. He's making the Y Chakabro thing.

433
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,960
 Parents are trying to calm him down. What's interesting, there's a couple interesting notes

434
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,320
 to this. That's not the end of the story, but that's the end of this one. This is going to unfurl

435
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:10,920
 very quickly. Charlie's father says, "Oh, that was me, Charlie. That was me. I was just pulling a

436
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,120
 joke. I'm sorry. I didn't think it would scare you. I crawled under your bed and my skin turned green

437
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,560
 and then I somehow ran out of the room and then ran back in. He didn't see me run out,

438
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,960
 but that was me, Charlie. Don't be afraid of that hand under your bed. It was just me.

439
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,760
 It was just the joke. I was just teasing you, buddy. Just ignore it. If you ever see that hand again,

440
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,280
 just ignore it."

441
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:45,960
 You know, obviously Charlie isn't writing this as a three-year-old now. He's an adult and he says,

442
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,840
 he goes, "It's weird because I look back on that. It's really hard for me to contextualize as a child."

443
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,280
 And my father admitted to it, so I figured it was him, but I mean, obviously it wasn't my

444
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,000
 hand. Obviously my dad doesn't have a big green hand. He wasn't able to fit under my bunk bed.

445
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,760
 He didn't run out of the room and run back in or anything like that. It wasn't my dad.

446
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,400
 He goes, "I also think it's weird that I feel like the hand was trying to communicate with me

447
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,760
 when he was throwing up in American Sign Language. He was trying to communicate with me." And I think,

448
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:26,040
 this is what Charlie was saying, he goes, "I think that what happened was this hand saw my hand."

449
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,880
 You know, everything else was covered up by the blankets, but I had my hand there,

450
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,160
 had my hand out. And I think he thought I also was a disembodied hand."

451
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,560
 Now, even though Charlie's dad said that was him underneath the bed with his hand,

452
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,720
 at the time Charlie might have believed that, but as he grew older, he knew that that wasn't true,

453
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:54,200
 because Charlie had just run into what's known as "La Mano Palluta," which generally means the

454
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:05,320
 hairy hand. It is a very popular... How would you classify this? Boogeyman, cryptid spirit, maybe,

455
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:12,520
 in Spanish-speaking countries. It's very popular in Mexico. You will run into a bunch of accounts.

456
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,800
 And when Charlie posted this, a bunch of people began sharing their stories, their encounters,

457
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,320
 with the green hairy hand. You would have a ton of these. What's interesting is some...

458
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,800
 We covered a story. We've actually covered multiple stories about disembodied hands and

459
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,120
 hairy hands. There were the hairy hands that would cause your car to veer off the road. That was an

460
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,400
 early episode of Dead Rav Radio. Like, that might have been in the 60s or the 70s. We've covered

461
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,240
 stories about hands tapping on bathroom windows and doing the finger gesture to try to lure people

462
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,520
 into other rooms. Disembodied hands seem to be... It's weird. I never really heard about them until

463
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:00,840
 I started doing the show. It's not a super common paranormal phenomenon, but it happens enough that

464
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,200
 in certain parts of the world you have names for that phenomenon. And, you know, again, a lot of

465
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,080
 the stories that we cover, I don't know where they take place, because they're just being posted online.

466
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,080
 For all I know, we know the British hands. That one's a famous one about that road, but it's

467
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,240
 possible these other stories we've covered about hands, maybe they've also taken place in

468
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,360
 Spanish-speaking countries. Talking about this one, the green hairy hand or the hairy hand,

469
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:32,440
 sometimes it's just a disembodied hand. It's not necessarily covered in hair. And Charlie actually

470
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,720
 says, you know, my dad said that he was the hand, and I guess I believed him at the time, but he had

471
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:48,360
 seen other... He goes, once I saw a green hand hanging out with other hands, he goes, listen,

472
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,480
 I'll be honest, this might have just been a series of nightmares. But he goes, I remember once seeing

473
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,880
 a green hand, a disembodied green hand, playing with a black hand and a white hand.

474
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,880
 He's like, okay, I don't know if that was real or not. And that's fair to say, right? He goes,

475
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,400
 it could have just been a dream, but he did though often have dreams nightmares. This definitely is

476
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:22,920
 a nightmare where he would fall asleep and then his nightmare would be disembodied hands tickling him.

477
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,600
 They would not only be tickling his feet, but they'd be tickling his hands. He'd have these

478
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:36,040
 disembodied hands tickling him, tickling his feet, tickling his rib cage, and then disembodied feet

479
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:42,440
 would show up as well. And then the disembodied hands and feet would try to suffocate him.

480
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,280
 And then he'd wake up.

481
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:57,240
 Now, I don't understand how he could be suffocated by a foot, but I'm sure it's possible. I'm sure,

482
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,240
 like, what if the hands were tickling you so much and you're like, and then a foot just shoved itself

483
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,920
 right into your mouth? I know at least one of you guys statistically has a huge foot fetish.

484
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,320
 And you're like, oh man, that boy's nightmares are my dreams. I figured you could breathe through

485
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,720
 your nose. I guess then another severed foot could stick its fingers up your nose

486
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,320
 and while you're still getting tickled. But anyways, forget the science of suffocation.

487
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,000
 He would have these nightmares where severed hands and feet were suffocating him, tickling

488
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,120
 him at first, and then suffocating him to make it even worse. And then a lot of other people

489
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:45,800
 started posting to reply to him their own disembodied hands stories. This is crazy,

490
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:55,480
 crazy stuff. There was a 12 year old girl who said one night she was sleeping and a green hand

491
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:05,080
 reached out from underneath her pillow and tried to grab her. I mean, that would be the sound of

492
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,400
 the girl jumping out of bed. Like, imagine if you were laying there in bed and then all of a

493
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,440
 sudden a hand came out from underneath your pillow. Try to grab you. But the story I just told,

494
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,800
 I don't know why I repeated it. Anyways, it would suck. You might definitely, you want to get

495
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,840
 good night's sleep that night, or ever. What would be the next night? You're like, oh man,

496
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,280
 that sure was crazy, but I'm really tired tonight. I'm gonna sleep in the same bed with the same pillow.

497
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,000
 I would just burn the bedroom down at a certain point. Yesterday's story, you had that woman wake

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,120
 up and there was a demon staring at her. I was like, demolish the house. I guess that's not true.

499
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,800
 You know, I do ghost hunts. This apartment's haunted and things like that. I'm not talking

500
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,520
 about blowing it up, but if a green hand, I would at least get a new pillow. Okay?

501
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,360
 Might not demolish the entire structure, but I'd get a new pillow. I'd sleep differently on the bed.

502
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,960
 Anyways, 12 year old girl, green hand trying to grab her. You also had a story of a young boy.

503
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,920
 This totally different person said, when he was a young boy, he was walking outside of his house

504
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,320
 and a pale white severed hand grabbed him.

505
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:22,840
 And it's interesting, you figure how strong can a severed hand be. I mean, I guess if it's a

506
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,520
 paranormal entity, it doesn't matter if it's done it, you know, like lifting weights. You wonder

507
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,400
 how strong it can be. This young boy got grabbed by a pale white severed hand and it began dragging

508
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:40,520
 him away. Pretty strong, right? Pretty strong to drag a kid away. Kid got freed though. He's not

509
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,600
 probably didn't post that story from the void. He's like, hey, I'm in a realm of hellish eternal

510
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,880
 torment. Let me tell you what, what's going on over here. I got dragged away by a pale white hand.

511
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:58,760
 He did get away. Going back to Charlie, he said that he had a cousin. A cousin of his also had to

512
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,680
 deal with the severed hands. He said one day she was in the basement and a severed green hand began

513
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:13,160
 chasing her up the stairs. You're like chasing out me. That was Adam's family. Now that's a little

514
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,200
 less creepy than one reaching out from behind your pillow. But anyways, she's in the basement

515
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,360
 and a severed green hand began chasing her up the stairs and she had a slam the door on it. It

516
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,600
 almost got her and she slammed the door. And then another Charlie said a close friend of mine had a

517
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,120
 cousin who late at night saw a green dismembered hand severed hand poking out of the closet,

518
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,840
 doing that coaxing motion with the finger to try and get her to come to the closet.

519
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,880
 So green hands all around. I find it interesting. Let's go back to the one running up the stairs.

520
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,920
 I wonder if it was doing the finger thing like the thing from is that what it's called or is it

521
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:03,720
 cousin it or whatever the hand from Adam's family. I wonder if it was running up with its fingers or

522
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,240
 if it was just floating like the question about this hand. I got a lot of questions about the hand

523
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:16,440
 honestly but this hand is the hand attached to another entity is my question. Was the hand

524
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,720
 floating up the stairs or was it running up on its fingertips. It's a pretty big detail to omit

525
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,760
 and the telling of the story but again Charlie's like this happened to a cousin of mine.

526
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,320
 And if it because if it's running up on finger it's a boo would be less scary.

527
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:39,320
 Imagine this imagine you're walking down a dark hallway and you turn around actually now that

528
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,080
 I think about it I don't know what would be scarier. If you're walking down a dark hallway the light's

529
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:53,560
 all flickering and you turn around and there's a hand a severed hand on the ground and it's like

530
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,760
 standing up on its fingers and the fingers begin like it's walking towards you using its fingers and

531
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,560
 you look down you're like ah that's scary but would it be scarier if you're in the dark hallway.

532
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:12,120
 You turn around and there's a severed hand just laying on the ground. Oh wait this would be scarier

533
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,400
 too now I've got another option. There's a severed hand laying on the ground and it begins like

534
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,240
 inching towards you like it's using its fingers and it gets a little bit closer.

535
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,960
 You know what I mean like you're like taking a nap while I'm doing it on the table like you can

536
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:33,160
 watch it. What if it moved like a snail so it's like pulling itself along the ground on its fingers

537
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,760
 as opposed to walking on its fingers like it's like going squishity squish like it's pulling itself

538
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,840
 along like you know like a snail or a slug it's just kind of oozing around the ground or that's

539
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:54,120
 option two or what or there there's a hand floating there there's a dismembered hand floating about

540
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:06,040
 chest level to you and that starts chasing you. Like they're clearly the floating hand would be the

541
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:13,240
 most terrifying because it doesn't make sense it would totally break your brain. If you saw a hand

542
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,920
 if you saw a severed hand moving on its own that would be weird but if you saw it using some form

543
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:26,040
 of known locomotion like using its fingers or sliding across the ground like a slug or a snail or a snake

544
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,640
 or worm that would make sense. You know what I mean like it wouldn't make sense there's severed

545
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:46,680
 hand moving but we understand the laws of locomotion we understand that but if it started

546
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,440
 just floating around in midair and then flying down the whole first off it'd be much faster

547
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:03,000
 if it was floating but even if it floated slowly that's scarier so if you were running up the stairs

548
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,080
 and a hand was floating after you look at it here's the thing at the end of the day

549
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:15,240
 I guess they're all scary I guess I guess anything chasing you if you're being chased by a dandelion

550
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,760
 that'd be terrifying if you're being chased by anything that could hurt you and a hand definitely

551
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,520
 like hands were made to hurt other things no one likes being chased down a dark hallway doesn't

552
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:35,240
 matter what it is so that's the story or stories about the green hairy hand a bogeyman-esque creature

553
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,480
 that terrifies children and really wants to steal them away I think that's kind of the end result

554
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,080
 for a lot of these things beckoning a child into the closet chasing them up the stairs

555
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,280
 grabbing onto one of them and dragging them through the front yard these are not the actions of an

556
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,200
 innocent person you definitely I'm pretty sure all of those are crimes if you did it just as a

557
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,360
 normal adult and if you did it as a ghost hand or some sort of creature hander like if that's

558
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,960
 interesting even so what is it right is it a cryptid is it a demon is it something that can

559
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,440
 only manifest as a hand does it choose to manifest as a hand it's fascinating take on the bogeyman

560
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:24,520
 legend and the question is is it real on the one hand all these stories come from very young

561
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,600
 children right three years old is pretty hard it's pretty young age to be the principal witness of

562
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,240
 a paranormal encounter so on the one hand you can dismiss a lot of it as overactive childhood

563
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,440
 imaginations or hearing a story from your cousin that's been exaggerated it wasn't a whole

564
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,760
 ansi-sino of the stairs it was only two fingers but you know what I mean like kids tend to exaggerate

565
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,840
 things and even if someone tells a child the truth their own imagination can add details to it that

566
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:05,480
 makes it even more imaginary so what is this is it a just the childhood nightmare of a urban legend

567
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,400
 passed from playground to playground I do find a clue for determining that answer in

568
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:19,320
 the father's reaction to this whole thing remember when the little boy was yelled out that that hand

569
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,360
 was tapping on his own the father came in and he didn't tell the boy he was just dreaming

570
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,960
 he didn't tell the boy that there's no such thing as monsters

571
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,240
 he told the boy it was me child it was me who was underneath your bed tapping on your hand

572
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,320
 and what it tells me is the father believes in the existence of the green hairy hand he

573
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,920
 doesn't deny that these things are real he doesn't deny the sensation that his son felt

574
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,000
 right he doesn't say it didn't happen it was all in your head he admits that yes something did

575
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,280
 reach out from underneath your bed something was tapping on your hand he doesn't deny that he says

576
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,560
 that yes those things happen but it was me it was not a monster it was me it was just a prank bro

577
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,480
 it was just a prank

578
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:18,840
 and that makes me think that because the father didn't deny it that he also believes in the

579
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:26,600
 existence of the green hairy hand this is a story no longer limited to the minds of children but

580
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:33,160
 even adults have to recognize the fact that something reached out from underneath that bunk bed

581
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:43,080
 he can't deny the truth because he knows the green hairy hand exists

582
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:54,120
 so imagine that father's terror as even as he was consoling his child saying don't worry son

583
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,960
 it was just me i was pulling a joke go back to sleep everything was okay as the father was

584
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:08,600
 saying those things he knew in the back of his mind the green hairy hand had zeroed in on his own

585
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:19,560
 flesh and blood and as that father shut the door to the boy's bedroom and walked back to his own a

586
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:32,120
 chill must have gone up his spine he knew he would now have to work overtime to keep his own sons

587
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:42,440
 safe from a creature he may have met in his own childhood from an entity he may have heard about

588
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:54,840
 from neighborhood friends from a demon that to this day neither father nor son nor anyone else

589
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:07,160
 who ever has encountered it can't explain exactly what it is the green hairy hand is a mystery

590
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:15,800
 but just because you can't explain the stories doesn't mean they're just stories
