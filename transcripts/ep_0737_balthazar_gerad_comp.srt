00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,420
 A man pulls out a gun and shoots a world leader for the first time in history.

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,840

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:24,600
 the Dutch Republic Splishity Splash Splishity Splash Barfee man is courageously leading

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,920
 us all the way across the Atlantic Ocean we're headed back to the year 1580 as well so let's

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
 make sure we navigate into that time portal over there it's 1580 so it's old timey all

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,400
 of a sudden we're wearing like old timey clothes they're super like itchy and heavy I bet you

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,440
 I bet you they are the most uncomfortable people on planet earth back in the 1580s because

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,240
 like cavemen were running around and like leopard skin so this documentary once called

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,520
 the Flintstones I know what it's like they're wearing like saber two tiger pelts and it's

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,760
 very breezy nowadays you know we wear like yoga pants and tank tops but in the 1580s

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,800
 everything was so heavy and woolen and super itchy and like then they're like hey we need

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,760
 to go into battle here put on like 80 pounds of steel you're like oh man I hope I get

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
 killed right away so that way I don't have to keep running around all this heavy stuff

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,240
 I bet you totally suck but it's 1580 we take all our clothes off retired walking around

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,680
 in these itchy itchy clothes and we're in Spain and there's this dude there and his name is

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,840
 King Philip and he's like you know what it sure is fun being the king of Spain officially

39
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm going to outlaw clothes but for now I'll allow them I'm King of Spain I'm also King

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,240
 of the Netherlands but I'm having some trouble up in the Netherlands you see there's this

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,840
 guy named William first of orange and he's this Dutch independence leader and he's really

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,200
 getting my goat which is literal literal back then because everyone had goats and William

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,720
 took one of King Philip's he's like listen you got to take care of them they're calling

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,200
 this guy like father of the fatherland I'm King so many to take care of William but

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,640
 William was such a beloved resistance leader that no one wanted to do it and King Philip

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,120
 stomped around the courtroom for a while and he issues a proclamation at a certain point

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,400
 he goes listen if you kill him I will give you 25,000 crowns that's money it's not just

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,240
 a bunch of crowns that you're like oh now what do I do with these I'm not king of 25,000

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,440
 countries 25,000 crowns was the currency you also gain a peerage which is like a class

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,600
 upgrade it's like a real life role-playing game and you get a house an estate it's not

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,200
 like some busted old Shrek house it's like you get fancy grass and put your own goats

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,520
 you get all sorts of goats and you get a big house so this goes on he makes his proclamation

53
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,080
 and in July of 1584 there's a dude named Balthazar Gerard he's a 26 year old man I know a bunch

54
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,460
 of history majors just shut the podcast off before they turn their ground out of fast

55
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,760
 forward because they know exactly where this story is going but for the rest of you ignorant

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,760
 goons strap in Balthazar Gerard 26 years old he goes I want that man I want the fame I

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,400
 want the fortune I want it all like Sharpey he heads out to Difft that's a city in the

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,040
 Dutch Republic but he gets there and he's like oh man you know what I'm missing I want

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,040
 to do this so I make money but I'm too poor this is a real problem I never thought about

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 this before he's too poor to assassinate somebody.

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,240
 He's too poor to assassinate somebody because you need like a weapon right and you need

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,120
 a weapon that will kill someone you can't walk around like a little dagger I mean you

63
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,320
 can and that'll kill someone but this guy has protection this guy has an army really

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,760
 is a resistance leader not really going to be all go up and shank this dude in lunchline

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,600
 he's like I don't have enough money to kill him I this is this is quite the conundrum

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,880
 but once I kill him I'll get all this money but he starts trying to borrow he goes all

67
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,280
 I need is 50 crowns if you guys got like 50 crowns laying around that's all I need and

68
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,280
 they're like what a foreign he's like to donate to somebody else what you think I'm here to

69
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,640
 kill William and they're like we didn't think that until you said it he's walking around

70
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,920
 and he can't get the money now he's dressed like a bum and this isn't this isn't a clever

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,320
 disguise of his he's a bum he's a bum he's just he's just a little down on his luck he

72
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,160
 just wants to murder a man make his dream come true at one point he's hanging around

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,080
 outside Williams house which is called the prizenhof it's just very very elegant mansion

74
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,040
 it's still there today he's outside the prizenhof he's this hobo and he's like oh man he's

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,160
 all doing he's picking flowers he's like I'll kill him I'll kill him not I'll kill him he's

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,600
 just wistfully dreaming of the day he will assassinate William and get a class upgrade

77
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,320
 he's like no more bum for me he's he's a bum though he's a bum he's outside this mansion

78
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,480
 so a royal guard comes up and goes hey you gotta get out of here no bumming around about

79
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,520
 the start tells the guard look at my rags look at how bummy I look and I know that's

80
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,400
 why he came over to accost me but I want to go to church man I want to find my peace with

81
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,360
 God before I kill William they're like what what's that last part oh nothing you think

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,040
 you could lend me some money so I could buy some new clothes so I could go to church and

83
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,880
 the guard goes ah I don't get paid enough for that but I know someone who may lend you

84
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,360
 some money so the guard goes to William and says hey there's this hobo outside he wants

85
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,920
 to go to church but his clothes are gross and they super stink and William says you know

86
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,800
 what I will give that young man 50 crowns so he can go to church guard gives Balthazar

87
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,160
 the money and he goes and he buys two pistols click click click click click yeah he goes

88
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,520
 by some non stinky clothes he's like whoo that guard was right I smelled he buys himself

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,640
 two pistols now remember we're in the year 1584 so firearms are readily available I mean

90
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,360
 they're part of military arsenal but 1584 what we're about to get to and I kind of gave

91
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,640
 it away in the beginning but this isn't the whole crux of the story 1584 we're about to

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:28,640
 witness the very first execution of a world leader by firearms now Balthazar didn't want

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,760
 50 bucks just to buy the guns he actually has a plan not only to execute but to get

94
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,520
 away with it because that's the key he's not a martyr he's not there to actually go and

95
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,240
 like a perform this for a cause he wants money and a class upgrade and that nice new house

96
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,520
 this is his plan he's going to go into the palace jump out surprise Balthazar surprises

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 guard shoot him twice that's why he has two guns he wants to make sure this works he then

98
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,400
 bought a pigs bladder I never would have thought of this Balthazar straight up and first off

99
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,960
 that's pretty dope name secondly James Bond of the 1584 he buys a pig bladder and apparently

100
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,560
 I didn't know that Looney Tunes actually were real physics a pig bladder I'm assuming he

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,520
 inflated it but this was his plan he was going to run jump off the rampart of the palace

102
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,200
 land in the moat this is old timey they still had all this stuff and the pig bladder would

103
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,280
 help him float across the moat he has a horse ready to go and before anyone can really even

104
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,880
 process this because no one has ever been executed a royal figure had never been assassinated

105
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,800
 with a gun before that alone would shock everyone he's going to be on his horse he's right in

106
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,400
 a way he's eventually going to get back to Spain he's going to get back into the safety

107
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:02,600
 of the king and he's going to get all this up he has his planned out July 10 1584 William

108
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 is walking down the stairs with his guards Balthazar jumps out shoot some twice hit some

109
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:22,840
 twice kills William father of the fatherland William the first of orange he starts to run

110
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,600
 out the guards are flabbergasted and they're all sitting around with like pikes and things

111
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,040
 like that they probably have their own pistols but you would it would be this equivalent

112
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,520
 as if you were sitting at work and someone walked in and vaporized your boss with a laser

113
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:42,720
 beam and then ran out you would you'd be like wait what that can happen these things exist

114
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 well they knew guns exist and they never thought they would see a leader of any sort of affluence

115
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,320
 die of one Balthazar's running he's busting loose from the castle he has his pig bladder

116
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,280
 ready to go he looks he sees this little horse winking winking on the other side of the moat

117
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,800
 he's getting ready to jump off the rampart into the moat he trips he trips on a pilot

118
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:12,440
 trash they didn't plan on and he falls to the ground not doesn't fall to the ground

119
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,360
 off the cliff of the building he just kind of tumbles in the ground the guards catch them

120
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,520
 and they beat the crap out of them it was after this I'm not done with the story if you guys

121
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,280
 are like oh that was kind of underwhelming that was just wrap this up though that was

122
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,520
 the first time a gun had ever been used in a political assassination and a gun was not

123
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:44,200
 used again until a 200 years later very very interesting they're so practical for assassinating

124
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,720
 people okay CIA agents in a state listening to that I did not mean what you think I do

125
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,520
 not mean exactly what I said they're so efficient but I think there is an in elegance to it

126
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,720
 but yeah between this now the use of all the time because it's where less civilized age

127
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
 but that happened and then it was another 200 years before someone goes you know what

128
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,200
 we should do what Balthazar did we should shoot our political leaders in the face but

129
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,440
 this might be there may be a reason why they didn't do this when they never shot anyone

130
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,320
 again because although his target died that is not the end of the story of Balthazar Balthazar

131
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:30,240
 is sitting in prison and this is prison in 1584 so they go but let the torturers begin

132
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,680
 so they some guy comes out of retirement he's like oh dude I've tortured all my life I tortured

133
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,160
 all those people and you know it's time for me to just it's time for me to hang up the

134
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,600
 human skin and become a farmer but now that this guy is killed William he has he deserves

135
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,760
 the worst torture possible so yeah this is what we're gonna talk about this is when history

136
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,160
 majors left this is what we're gonna talk about for the next seven minutes he's hung

137
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:05,340
 on a pole and he's whipped watch and then this is what's so weird one I think a lot

138
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,920
 of this torture stuff is exaggerated I think a lot of these historical torturers we covered

139
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,520
 one before about a guy who had to sit in a red hot chair and they use red hot clamps

140
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,520
 to pull off his thumbs and his toes and stuff like that and I go with the chair would have

141
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,720
 killed like the shock from sitting in the chair would have killed him on the spot and

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,640
 so on because when I put that episode on YouTube I had a bunch of torture porn aficionados

143
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,360
 been like no it was real man it was totally real don't ruin my dreams and I was like it

144
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,940
 probably wasn't they probably got a red hot chair he would have had a heart attack for

145
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:45,740
 even gotten to the chair I know what was coming I think a lot of it or he's dead at that point

146
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,740
 and they're like and then we did this and did that so I think a lot of this torture

147
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:57,580
 stuff is exaggerated to this stuff is so incongruent like you tie me to a pole and you whip me

148
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,300
 I'm not having a good day right I'm not Rihanna it doesn't turn me on but then okay so this

149
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,160
 is this is okay so starting off right from the beginning supposedly this is all really

150
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,000
 happened but jigsaw would be like really dude really that's a little that's a little ridiculous

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,800
 they whip him with a whip then they smear him with honey which would be so soothing I have

152
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,960
 a sore throat I would love honey right now but they smear him with honey and which you

153
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,320
 think if it helps your throat it would also help the bleeding wounds caused by the whip

154
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:39,140
 then they bring out a goat and describe this goat has a sandpaper tongue I don't know if

155
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,100
 I don't know if all goats do I don't know if this goat was specifically bred for honey

156
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,540
 torture but they bring the goat out and the idea is is the goat with its sandpaper tongue

157
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,820
 is going to lick him and it's going to hurt and that's why the honey's on him so goat

158
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,540
 will lick what type of torture is that just whip him for another 10 minutes think about

159
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,600
 all the work that goes into that there's some guys like autos like hey guys they came over

160
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,680
 I had this crazy dream last night how about we cover him in honey and we have a goat lick

161
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
 it off of him and think about how long it would take to cover a human being in honey

162
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:18,320
 lead the goat in and then he's like ow ow what like eventually like when it isn't hurt

163
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,440
 it tickles I don't care how rough a goat's tongue is you just got whipped you just got

164
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:32,300
 whipped and the goat doesn't lick up the honey this is all historical this is hilarious

165
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,540
 the goat makes some historian had to write this down and go wait what the goat the goat

166
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,340
 didn't even do anything the goat didn't lick him do goats even like honey what's going

167
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,860
 on here the goat does not want to lick him now they never say that it washed they washed

168
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,260
 him off I'm assuming they didn't I'm assuming they were like well that didn't work let's

169
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,240
 wash the honey off of this political assassin will assume he's covered in honey for the

170
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,480
 rest of the time which would be super sticky of punishment in and of itself they then tie

171
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:12,600
 they take him this is ridiculous they take him and they roll him into a ball they roll

172
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,320
 him into a ball and tie him together so now he's like a ball now he's like a human ball

173
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,740
 of yarn I don't know if they covered him completely in rope where they're like the guards are

174
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,540
 like hey where's Balpas are and they're like that's him you're like what oh I thought it

175
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,260
 was a giant ball of yarn I think they just like hog tied him I don't know if they completely

176
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:43,540
 covered him up Garfield is playing with him they tie him up in a ball so he can't sleep

177
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,160
 which I'm gonna take a stab in the dark no pun intended I think being whipped I think

178
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,680
 being whipped a lot and being afraid you're gonna get tortured the next day that's gonna

179
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,360
 keep you awake too I could probably fall asleep in a ball shape actually people sleep in the

180
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,960
 fetal position all the time so you could totally do that he's already had this whore I can

181
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,640
 almost guarantee you this is the rest of the episode I don't know if we're gonna have time

182
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,520
 for the other one but he's maybe we'll do a second shorter story for the next three

183
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,100
 days about this are now it's public humiliation right now that they've experimented with the

184
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,900
 goat and that didn't work now they're bringing them out into the public they strap them to

185
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:31,100
 a pole and they mock him boo you suck man boo you're super sticky he's like that's not

186
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,220
 my fault they make me sticky they're like no no excuses the buck stops with you you're

187
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,820
 gross you're gross that I would be like why for three days I mean it might hurt my feelings

188
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,320
 a bit I bet you you can't fall asleep as a ball I can throw his balls you're like oh

189
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,680
 I wish I could be free in a ball but that's nothing dude like really what could you say

190
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,480
 to me over the course of three days that would be worse than me getting whipped well they

191
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,760
 haven't tied up and they're mocking him for three days and then they take the against

192
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,720
 bizarre escalation like okay is everyone did everyone say something mean about this guy

193
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,340
 okay you good you in the back you said something mean about okay now let's move on to the next

194
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,580
 stage they should have just done this they should have done this for three days they

195
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:30,460
 took 300 pounds of stones and tie them to his big toes that's torture but logically he

196
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,260
 would have no toes he would have no toes at this point they let these 300 pound weights

197
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:42,160
 hang for 30 minutes my toes my toes shut up complainer they're like no no the mocking

198
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,920
 portion is over sir you can't mock him this is the stone on the top or sorry sorry I didn't

199
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,440
 know that for 30 minutes during your pounds on your toes I weigh almost during the pounds

200
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,000
 I put a bunch of weight on my vacation I did put on some weight but imagine me hanging

201
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,820
 on two of me hanging on to a dude's toes me stepping on a guy's toes would be incredibly

202
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,480
 painful imagine him hanging from a pole and me being like you get up there as I'm pulling

203
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,120
 on his toes for 30 minutes then they have a real feet thing over in the Dutch Republic

204
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,120
 I don't know if it's still a thing that they have this weird fetish feet fetish thing but

205
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,440
 in back then they definitely did if you're pulling on his toes then they go bring out

206
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,280
 the shoes bring out the shoes and he must be like I'm not from around here maybe they're

207
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,240
 really fancy shoes maybe they're the shoes of forgiveness maybe they'll let me go they

208
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:50,680
 bring out shoes and they're well oiled uncured dog skin shoes and they're too small who cares

209
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,960
 someone was just hanging on my toes who cares if the shoes are too small well you didn't

210
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,080
 let me finish you take these uncured dog skin shoes and you put them on your feet and they're

211
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,320
 super tiny and what happens is he's then hung over a fire again that's enough right just

212
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 hanging someone over a fire don't have to mock them you hang them over a fire and these

213
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:26,600
 shoes they dry and they start to get smaller and smaller and smaller eventually these

214
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:38,480
 shoes tightened up until he had no more feet because the the okay now I don't think that's

215
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,520
 possible I've come across other torture stories where people get sewn into cow hides and then

216
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 the hide is put out in the sun and the hide crushes them as it dries and that's a little

217
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,200
 more believable because you can suffocate someone by simply putting pressure on their

218
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,560
 chest that'll kill them they can't breathe but you have all sorts of foot bones and stuff

219
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,200
 like that I don't care if you put small shoes on me and they slowly cooked you think they

220
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,280
 would just crumble away you think there's like a path of less resistance the human foot

221
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,880
 that's genetically engineered to last 80 years and run across savannahs in the pursuit of

222
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:25,560
 wilder beasts or or dog skin or dried up or non dried up wet dog skin that's slowly dries

223
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,760
 they could just fall apart but now he doesn't have feet they've been crushed they're nothing

224
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:37,280
 but stumps due to this scientifically dubious torture method then they take his shoes off

225
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,640
 and I'm assuming he's got my shoes my new shoes no I came to love those things they

226
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,400
 take his shoes off and they brand his armpits they take his shoes off I only have a few

227
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,960
 more of these okay they take his brand new shoes off he's like no I'll always remember

228
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,600
 the times we had together he has a scrapbook he has a scrapbook and spritters of his feet

229
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,680
 getting smashed and then they go put your arms up I think his arm I don't think they

230
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,680
 asked him politely I think he's still like bound with his arms up they take a hot branding

231
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,600
 iron and brand them under his armpits it's a picture of his shoes you'll never forget

232
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,800
 your shoes I wasn't going to anyways I love those shoes they brand an image of the shoes

233
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 underneath his arms then it said that they so so bizarre how did you picture this guy

234
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,280
 the whole time I pictured him like old timey clothing like maybe he just has on underwear

235
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,840
 like they're not naked because they're probably Puritans but he's probably wearing like rags

236
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,520
 for underwear that's about it I mean how do you dress a man for public torture they soak

237
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,840
 his shirt and alcohol and I spread that ago he's still wearing his shirt they didn't catch

238
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,160
 on fire they didn't get all bloodied up apparently he still had on a shirt this whole time they

239
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,920
 covered an alcohol and then it was weird right they covered alcohol you think what are they

240
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,680
 going to set him on fire if he's going to die eventually Jason is this man being tortured

241
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,800
 to this day they take because that's what I would have done if I had to cover someone

242
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,320
 in alcohol I would have thrown matches at him and would have like taken satisfaction

243
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,720
 to knowing nine of the matches out of the ten will actually extinguish as I'm throwing

244
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,280
 them at the person I'm not a torch I actually despise torture but if I was torturing someone

245
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,000
 this is what I would do I'd keep throwing the matches because I know eventually one's

246
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
 going to light it but most of them won't and there's a psychological torture so I think

247
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,320
 they're going to do something like this right now I don't think they even had matches back

248
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:44,880
 then they cover his shirt and alcohol and then they pour bacon fat boiling baking fat

249
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:54,160
 all over his body just skip the shirt just get the shirt dude if you have boiling pig

250
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,440
 fat just laying around I'm sure they boiled it specifically for this just do that just

251
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,240
 do that you don't have to go well first let's get his shirt all nice and juicy anyways that

252
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:20,400
 happens then okay just one two three can it's only only five more I mean they really went

253
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,040
 to work on this guy they really really went to town on this guy you're like he's just

254
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,960
 such a despised torture and yet you seem to be awfully entertained by this again I think

255
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,440
 a lot of this stuff is exaggerated and in the case in point he just had boiling pig fat

256
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,360
 actually looking at my notes it said burning pig fat so maybe the maybe the burning pig

257
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,200
 fat was to soak mechs with the alcohol and the shirt but I mean like that's saying like

258
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,240
 if someone's like spilling like lighter fluid around your house and then they bring in a

259
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,440
 bunch of napalm you're like you didn't have to use the you know these lighter fluid you're

260
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,720
 gonna bring out the napalm so maybe he's like ah but he's burning or boiling one of the

261
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,000
 two it's super painful no matter what then they go let's put nails let's get some nice

262
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,040
 metal nails and shove them underneath his fingernails and his toenails the man's boiling

263
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,400
 pig fat at this point ah and then some guys like whoa put it out put it out put it out

264
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,160
 you know what I explain them down you know what we should do we should put like metal

265
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,480
 nails and people like what that's such a deescalation just keep covering them in pig fat but anyway

266
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,280
 so this on a red this and I go wait a second he has toenails still doesn't have toes doesn't

267
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,360
 have foot how are you gonna so stuff like that I go they're just making stuff up but

268
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,400
 anyway so then boiling pig fat metal steel underneath your nails now it's execution day

269
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,600
 this has been going on for a while they have all the balloons they release a bunch of balloons

270
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,120
 their little skull faces are floating through the air kids are ready they have their popcorn

271
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:02,800
 it's the day of execution this is what they do they take his right hand I don't know why

272
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,360
 because he killed him with both hands but they take his right hand and they burn it off

273
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:17,840
 ah that was my second favorite hand ah then they get some metal pinchers you're like just

274
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,760
 skip to the end just skip to the end they have metal pinchers and they rip they described

275
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:34,160
 it as they ripped off his skin from six places which begs the question which six which six

276
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,600
 and you go Jason nobody's asking that question this poor man has been suffering for days

277
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,520
 but it's like if you had like obviously if someone came at me with metal pinchers and

278
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,800
 says I'm gonna pinch off six pieces of your skin like I would go okay get a little bit

279
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,840
 get a little bit of my thigh maybe some now you won't want your butt because you gotta

280
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,000
 sit down on that but like there's places in your body you'd be like no I'm fine you can

281
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,160
 like take out like the webbing between my index finger and my thumb because I don't use

282
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,840
 that too often I mean that probably grows back maybe a little bit of elbow so which

283
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,480
 six this guy this guy's not worried about whether or not you can play video games he's

284
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,040
 gonna be executed by wonder which six places did it have any significance it doesn't matter

285
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:24,400
 because he is eventually quartered or you rip off your arms and your legs he's disemboweled

286
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,120
 they rip his heart out while he's still alive because you know getting your getting your

287
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,160
 he would listen he would have died long before this of just infection and shock but let's

288
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,720
 assume that the Dutch the Dutch people in most prolific liars and have a foot fetish

289
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,120
 he disemboweled him he's still alive they cut his heart out he's still alive they throw

290
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,280
 they throw his own art in his face while he's still alive he gets to feel the sensation

291
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,840
 of his own heart hitting him and be like that was less weird than I thought it would be

292
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,920
 honestly thought it would be more shocking and then they chop his head off and Balthazar

293
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:11,480
 Gerard 26 years old is finally dead finally got the punishment for the execution of William

294
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:18,320
 the first of orange very very interesting story I honestly didn't expect it to last

295
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,800
 that long I just got such a kick out of it maybe maybe because I'm going through my own

296
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,880
 mildly uncomfortable pain that I could sit and look at the pain of another man and chuckle

297
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,760
 that's not true I found that story I found that story on a day I felt great and I still

298
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,840
 had to get laugh about it we don't have enough time to do the second story about the girl

299
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,160
 whose sister was a ghost hunter that's a really cool and we're going to see that one for tomorrow

300
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,280
 let me take a quick look though and see what I got ready to go that's relatively short

301
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,800
 it's interesting in a different way let me it's interesting in a different way than

302
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,120
 I'm used to covering so let's go ahead and get started on this one Barfee man I'm gonna

303
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,960
 toss you the keys to the Carbenter copter we are leaving behind the Dutch Republic we're

304
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:09,560
 saying goodbye to Saint Balthazar Gerard we are headed on out to Mount St. Helens Washington

305
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:19,840
 and I got this story from a good friend of mine Sabine and she was very excited about

306
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:29,720
 it she was like Jason I have a story for you might go oh cool you like the enthusiasm

307
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:38,000
 Matt it's May 18th 1980 and Mount St. Helens erupts lava is going everywhere I don't think

308
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,280
 there was lava I don't think it was like a Hollywood movie but there was ash that was

309
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,320
 the big problem a lot of people were killed by the ash very very deadly I think it might

310
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,120
 be the most deadly volcano eruption in modern US history I'm pulling that I'm pulling that

311
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,760
 out of my butt so if that's not true please save the hate mail but 57 people were killed

312
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,880
 it caused 3.5 billion dollars in today money the largest landslide in recorded history happened

313
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,000
 when part of Mount St. Helens fell apart but that's all pretty interesting right volcanoes

314
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,520
 I think the very first episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I talk about volcanoes I love the topic

315
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,000
 of volcanoes that's not why we're talking about it that's not why we're adding this

316
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,640
 episode adding this tail into my torture porn episode that I just did people believe that

317
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,120
 not only did Mount St. Helens cause all this death and damage but it also released the

318
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,040
 bat squash I never heard of the bat squash before so when Sabine told me about the bat

319
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,880
 squash she read about it in the Guardian I believe and I go what I never heard of the

320
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,480
 same must be fake if I didn't hear about it if I Jason Garvin I didn't hear about it but

321
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,320
 I didn't think it was fake but I go that's weird I never heard about it I'll have to

322
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,000
 look it up my interest was peaked Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption bat squash comes

323
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:06,120
 flying out of it sounds pretty interesting I was I was wrong I was wrong this topic is

324
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,560
 dumb it's super dumb and that the it's so funny because I've been wanting to talk about

325
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,680
 this but this is actually great this episode might run a little long but I've been wanting

326
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,280
 to talk about this because it's dumb I didn't really know how to fit it in because I didn't

327
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,560
 want to build up the topic like in a way that I'm doing now and then reveal and think about

328
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:32,760
 it how many times do I cover style cover stuff that I think is dubious factually I'll say

329
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,880
 I don't know if this is true but let's put on our conspiracy calves but I never really

330
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,080
 covered topics I think that I personally I think it's dumb until now and that's the reason

331
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,040
 why I want to talk about it I it's this let me tell you briefly what the back of the

332
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,000
 Squatch is originally I was hoping to get this done in like five minutes but I can already

333
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,520
 tell it's gonna spiral out of it and don't leave because you go it's stupid Jason

334
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,240
 says it's stupid so it's not in good the bad Squatch is described as this it's nine feet

335
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:08,080
 tall it weighs as much as two grown grizzly bears I have no idea I have no idea how they

336
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,640
 got that estimate but it weighs as much as and the multiple sightings of this thing blue

337
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,400
 fur odd detail right it's blue has a wolf like muzzle and it has bird like wings that

338
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,120
 span out to 50 feet now it's unlike the mothman because when she was telling me about this

339
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,000
 I go so it's I am thinking it's like the mothman it's connected to this disaster it's connected

340
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,560
 to Mount St. Helens it flew out when you look at any account of the bat Squatch they talk

341
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,360
 about it being related to Mount St. Helens this is what's so weird about this I read multiple

342
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,480
 articles on this hoping the story would get slightly interesting and it got dumber and

343
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,360
 dumber I think there has to be something else going on here there has to be something else

344
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,040
 going on here people every article basically states that this thing came out of Mount St.

345
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:04,160
 Helens but the very first sighting of it was not until 1994 14 years later in Pierce County

346
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,880
 Washington April 1994 Brian Canfield said he was driving his truck it breaks down he

347
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,720
 sees a blue winged creature flying overhead there was another sighting in Mount Chasta

348
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,440
 California in 2009 several hikers see a winged creature that matching the description of

349
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,080
 bat Squatch down in Cali it's dumb super dumb you would say this is what's so fascinating

350
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,680
 you would think the idea of a flying Sasquatch on paper it sounds amazing but it could be

351
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:45,560
 a whole new layer to the Bigfoot mythos a flying one with wings I that I heard that I

352
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,440
 was like that's awesome it's not it's super boring let's put on our conspiracy caps here

353
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,240
 I believe that and I we've talked about this before and I'm not the only one who believes

354
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,240
 this either because we had other people kind of put their own spin on it I believe that

355
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,040
 there are hidden codes out there we've talked about these codes being used to pass on insider

356
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,840
 trader information we did an episode on that but even before that revelation which I find

357
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,200
 very fascinating I and this may fall into that I think that sometimes these stories

358
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 are put out there as codes coded messages for other people and unless you know what

359
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,320
 the end message is or how to break the code or who it's belongs to it makes no sense out

360
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,080
 of all of the stories we've ever covered on the show this is probably the most bland and

361
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,560
 it shouldn't be a flying Bigfoot should be awesome I did a ton of research on this thing

362
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,600
 you can follow it up on your the show notes it's not good she didn't find it in the Guardian

363
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:57,800
 the the story of or the newspaper organ live did it but there's a lot of stuff on this

364
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 and it all sucks it's all really really bad so why if it's made up it should be so fantastical

365
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,480
 it can't help but peak your imagination if it's really could be mundane but none of

366
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,200
 the details out of why do they keep connecting it to the Mount St. Helens mythos it's almost

367
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:25,240
 like there's something else behind it there's a new show coming out on Fox Nation which

368
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,040
 I is either some cable network I think it's a cable network that streams online called

369
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,000
 monsters across America and one of the episodes they're doing is the bat squash of Mount St.

370
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,440
 Helens that episode's coming out pretty soon like this article is printed just back in

371
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,160
 August of 2021 why now I mean sure that's just a television show that needs filler material

372
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,880
 I get it but there's way there's just so many better cryptids there even there's even better

373
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,320
 bigfoot stories to tell than this one that there's been very there's been no photographs

374
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,200
 there's been no video footage there's been sporadic sightings over the last 30 some odd

375
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,400
 years I believe there's something else going on to this story I believe it's coming out

376
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,560
 now because the story's been around for a while but I believe it's being publicized

377
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,200
 now because it's and again conspiracy cat fully on but this is a conspiracy cat theory

378
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,840
 that I believe that a lot of times we cease to not predictive programming that's not

379
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,400
 what I'm talking about I'm talking about I have a message that I need to send you so

380
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,760
 I'm gonna put it in a way that no one else will be able to decipher it that's what I'm

381
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,320
 saying I do find an interesting connection to this though and this is something Sabine

382
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:41,040
 also brought up maybe Sabine is in on this mountain madness as this episode's currently

383
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,640
 gonna be hitting the air on that Fox Nation show right now there's a expedition on Mount

384
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,920
 Adams in Washington it's another volcano there's a group of people around Mount Adams who sincerely

385
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:03,040
 believe that this mountain has a hatch in it a portal a physical portal that you can

386
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,440
 find open up and go into and find this alien base there's been alien sightings around Mount

387
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,600
 Adams for decades they believe it's there's a base in the mountain and this is the lowest

388
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:26,880
 snow level like the lowest snowpack on Mount Adams in decades so these UFOs are scurrying

389
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,200
 all over the mountain all day long and they have been for months if they're going to find

390
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,320
 the hatch they believe they're gonna find it now because any other time it would be completely

391
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,640
 covered up by snow this is their best chance to find the hatch you know what it's weird

392
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:50,640
 you can find a ton of information on bat squash right now I can find none about this hatch

393
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,920
 I've heard about the UFO legends around Mount Adams I know there's groups out there that

394
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,280
 believe in that but I wasn't able to find a single article and there is a lot of activity

395
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,320
 on the mountain right now I wasn't able to find this any I wasn't able to find a single

396
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,880
 article Facebook group anything about this search am I saying the two stories are connected

397
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,600
 am I saying the saga of bat squash being in the media all of a sudden is a message about

398
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,120
 what's really going on at Mount Adams and they're keeping that one under wraps I don't

399
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:30,520
 know what I'm saying honestly I just find it very very convenient that one topic about

400
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,440
 volcanoes is super popular I wouldn't say popular it's super dumb it's boring I can't

401
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,600
 imagine a show dedicating 30 minutes to it and then we have this other thing going on

402
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,400
 in a volcano in the same state that could have world changing ramifications that there's

403
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:58,400
 no information on misdirection look over there not here because we saw what happened with

404
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,360
 a raid area 51 right all those people were talking about it not everyone showed up but

405
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,120
 there was a big thing imagine that same thing on land does not control by the government

406
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,160
 imagine if there was a big push find the hatch find the hatch find the hatch you'd have all

407
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,680
 the forest fin weirdos you'd have all the alien you'd have all the area 51 people out there

408
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,840
 you have all these big parties rescue crews that have to be going up there and it would

409
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:27,720
 actually impede the search for the real hatch if there is one but is there a connection between

410
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,920
 the bat squash story coming out now I don't know I feel like there is I feel like there

411
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,360
 is and sometimes as a conspiracy theorist I mean you can't never win an argument like

412
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:44,440
 that you can never sway anyone's opinion but I feel like there is because otherwise why

413
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,160
 is such a dumb story getting play why is the bat squash story becoming popular and I get

414
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,520
 it not everyone has to be in the same things that I'm into but if you're there's just so

415
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,000
 much other better bigfoot stuff that's what you want to talk about and even just better

416
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,320
 cryptids in general bat squash I get wanting to cover something that's obscure I'm glad

417
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,800
 that they're covering stuff that's obscure but at a certain point you got to look into

418
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,480
 and go well it's obscure because it's lame right I don't know and you may feel like I'm

419
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,680
 being a gatekeeper you may wish I still continue to talk about torture but yeah I'm just very

420
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,440
 puzzled by it and I have no pithy way to wrap this episode up I didn't plan on doing this

421
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,280
 this is one of those topics that I did all the research and it took all the notes and

422
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,040
 I thought I don't know if I'm ever going to cover this because the topic itself I don't

423
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:41,800
 find super intriguing but the topic behind the topic might be more important than a big

424
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,640
 blue monster flying out of a volcano you almost have to go out of your way to make this story

425
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:56,600
 boring right like it should just intrinsically be awesome but it's just not that good which

426
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,480
 I find in an odd way even more fascinating than the middle of the road cryptid story

427
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,520
 that I would have told and it would have taken me five to ten minutes and then we would have

428
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,400
 forgotten about it because we would have moved on to the next episode maybe I would have

429
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:17,280
 referenced it once or twice going forward but is this story I'm assuming that the people

430
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,760
 really saw something back in 1994 but I man I it's kind of hard for me to wrap my head

431
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,320
 around like what am I saying that the story is real wouldn't that be trippy if the story

432
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,680
 is not real and they made it up because this is super easy we've discovered this before

433
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,720
 on this show the story never happened and they made it up recently and they backtracked

434
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,400
 it to make it look like it was older that's happened before we've covered that stuff before

435
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,880
 with like the lone pine devils which was totally fake I don't know I feel like I'm just kind

436
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,920
 of spiraling out and I could probably keep talking over and over again about this but

437
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,080
 I it's weird and sometimes when we look at these stories we have to look at the reason

438
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,400
 behind the stories a lot of urban legends I say this all the time are cautionary tales

439
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,440
 but some of these stories may be planted by the government or by other agencies and they

440
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,920
 use them to communicate information between each other and right now the story of the

441
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,160
 bat-squatch being aired on fox nation and getting press and organ live and I'm assuming

442
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,760
 other newspapers as well as all the websites that I found it on could be a signal bat-squatch

443
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,720
 yeah it's lame the government agents know that but pay attention to what's happening

444
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,480
 on that other volcano in Washington that may be a story that's far less lame that may be

445
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:40,360
