1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
 A supernatural thief on the run from the law.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,760
 And then we visit a town in England that seems to have a taste for fire,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,560
 fear, and the souls of children today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:19,240
 [music]

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,180
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,260
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,160
 I hope you're having a great day too. We have a lot of good stuff for you today.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,800
 [music]

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,320
 So I wanted to start the story off with the tale of a photo that I happened to find

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,240
 while I was out walking today.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,480
 Now, of course, talking about a photo can be difficult about on a podcast.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,400
 And I'm going to start off by saying that this story is 100% true,

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,960
 because you could be thinking, "Oh, Jason's just larping.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,000
 Jason's just trying to set up some narrative going on with the podcast."

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,800
 But today I was-- and it's 100% true.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,320
 I showed the picture to Veronica earlier.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,360
 I kind of had to explain to her why the picture was more worrying than normal.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,880
 But it could be a totally logical explanation for this.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
 So let me actually go get the picture here.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:24,880
 [music]

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,320
 It's not like I can actually show it to you or anything, but--

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,680
 So I found this picture. It's on one of those little instax,

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,200
 Fuji film instax thing.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,640
 It's basically the kid version of an old Polaroid camera,

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,040
 like I had when I was a kid.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,400
 So it's a little picture. It's probably about two inches by an inch and a half,

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,920
 a pink border on it.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,720
 And in the picture, what I'm going to do too,

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,200
 just so you can have a frame of reference,

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880
 is I'm going to take a photograph of this picture,

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,760
 and I will put it up on the website.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,920
 So if you go to deadravid.com, you'll see a copy of the picture.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
 And if you're listening to this on YouTube,

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,400
 you're probably looking at a photo of it right now.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,200
 So let me explain to you a little bit about it.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
 It's funny because I didn't plan on talking about this,

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,200
 so we'll see about those other stories.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,800
 But the photo, you're going to see black smudges on the sides.

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
 That's not dirt or anything to make it look any creepier.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,280
 It is the ink coming off of the back of the picture.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,480
 The little film has been slightly removed.

42
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,600
 When I found this, it was raining.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 So it wasn't in the best condition,

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
 but all the dirt isn't to make it look spooky.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,920
 That is just ink.

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,520
 I got ink all over my hands when I picked this photo up as well.

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,800
 I had to carry it with me.

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
 But if you're not looking at the photo right now,

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
 let me explain it briefly to you.

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,760
 The camera is tilted slightly.

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,120
 So the camera itself is tilted slightly.

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,800
 So it gives it a look as if someone

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
 wasn't looking straight on at their subject,

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
 but they're holding their camera at a,

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,920
 I don't know, 60 degree angle.

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,120
 In the picture, we see what looks to be an apartment.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
 The apartment looks fairly,

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
 I don't want to say abandoned

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
 'cause that makes it too creepy,

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,560
 but you can see that the blinds are kind of a skew.

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,720
 They're not lined up right.

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,960
 The only thing we see in the photo is an oven, a stove,

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,320
 I guess whatever, that thing that you put food in.

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,920
 Cabinets, the top of a chair,

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,160
 presumably a kitchen chair,

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
 a couple of knickknacks on a windowsill.

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,560
 And what appears to be a young woman cowering in fear

68
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
 of whoever's taking the picture.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,240
 So my first instinct obviously is that

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,000
 this is a staged photo some kids are messing around.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
 And that is very likely.

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,320
 There's actually three scenarios here.

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,360
 One is that this is a staged photo

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,800
 and these kids are messing around

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
 and they either lost it

76
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
 or they left it there intentionally.

77
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,480
 It was raining.

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,040
 So again, if someone was going to put this out there

79
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,640
 to be like, ooh, let's do some spooky stuff.

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
 You may want to have waited until it wasn't raining

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
 or put it somewhere where it wouldn't get wet,

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,600
 but again, it just adds to the creepiness factor

83
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 that it was sitting out in the rain.

84
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,440
 It was sitting face up, I walked right by it

85
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,680
 and looked down, picked it up.

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
 The other option is this.

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,360
 So there is a famous, if you're into true crime,

88
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,640
 you most likely have seen this photo before.

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,360
 Let me actually get some more info on it.

90
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,920
 Again, I didn't plan on doing this part of the show.

91
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,740
 I showed it to Veronica and I was going to save it,

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,760
 but I was just looking at it on my,

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
 put it on the top of my fridge and I said,

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,040
 "No, I'm going to do that story now."

95
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,080
 So let me get some quick information for you here.

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,920
 So there is, if you're into true crime,

97
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,460
 you've come across this photo.

98
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,880
 It's a very famous photo.

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 It's the last photo of Regina K.

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,200
 And who Regina K is?

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,920
 Sorry, it's the last photo of a woman named Regina K. Walters

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,220
 and I'll also have this photo on deadrabbit.com.

103
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,860
 All the show notes are going to be in as normal.

104
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,320
 So if you forget the website or whatever,

105
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 you can still locate this stuff.

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,700
 But I really think you should check it out.

107
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,300
 There is a photo of a woman named Regina K. Walters.

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,000
 She is, it was chilling the first time I saw it.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,580
 It's actually still quite chilling, but.

110
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,640
 It's a photo of her standing on what looks to be

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,640
 an abandoned barn or a house that has been partially destroyed.

112
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,060
 She is standing there, her hair has dyed black.

113
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,240
 She's wearing different clothes than she had on

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,780
 than when she was kidnapped.

115
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,620
 And she's cowering in fear in front of the camera.

116
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,180
 And the camera is tilted about 60, 70 degrees at an angle.

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,660
 So that's what made me a little more suspicious of the photo

118
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,660
 is that it matches this very famous true crime photo.

119
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,960
 So the first option again is that it's completely made up

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,180
 and it just coincidentally matches one of the most famous

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,700
 last photos of a victim that it's pretty iconic again,

122
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,060
 if you've in true crime, you've probably seen it.

123
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,980
 The second scenario is that it is fake

124
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,980
 and it happens to, sorry, the second scenario

125
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,220
 is that it is fake and the people who took it

126
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,340
 were making it match that photo in the first place.

127
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,860
 That was kind of the point.

128
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,460
 They go, oh, that's a creepy photo.

129
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,440
 Let's do that.

130
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,620
 Let's do this sideways thing, this angle.

131
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,340
 The third option, the least likely of all the options

132
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,860
 is that it's real, that this young, unidentified woman

133
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,700
 was really cowering in fear that the photo was staged

134
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,780
 as some sort of fetish or warning or trophy.

135
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,220
 As of now, there's been no reports of missing women

136
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,100
 in my area.

137
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,140
 So, and it's a small town.

138
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,060
 So it's not something that I'm super concerned about.

139
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,180
 I just think it's an interesting item.

140
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,980
 So we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna hold onto this.

141
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,500
 And again, I want to 100% assure you

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,780
 that this is not a LARP, this is not an ARG,

143
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,820
 this is not some fictional narrative

144
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,980
 that I am building up for the podcast.

145
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,060
 This is 100% true.

146
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,140
 And I understand if you go, Jason's just mucking about.

147
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,780
 Like, I get that you would think that.

148
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,340
 I know that I did the four short story episodes

149
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,100
 a while back, but those were completely different

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,940
 intro music, completely different tone.

151
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,180
 They were labeled as such.

152
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,740
 I may continue to do this, I don't know.

153
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,940
 They still get hits, but I don't know

154
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,980
 if I'm gonna keep doing that.

155
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,700
 But this is 100% true.

156
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,340
 As far as my part of the story of finding the photograph,

157
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,240
 I can't verify that the photo itself is not fake.

158
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,940
 But if it is fake, I had no part in taking the photo.

159
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,540
 I had no part in planning the photo.

160
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,160
 I had no part in anything like this.

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,660
 It was just laying on a rock as I was walking by.

162
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,780
 And I'm not so famous in my area

163
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,620
 that someone would be like,

164
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,900
 "Oh, Jason Carpenter walks by here.

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,740
 "Let's leave him a photo and get on his podcast."

166
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,900
 So, yeah, really weird.

167
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,700
 I took it, I showed it to Veronica.

168
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,540
 She thought it was weird.

169
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,680
 I showed her the backstory and showed her the photo

170
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,020
 of the young woman who was also missing.

171
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,300
 The dude who did kill her, I just looked that up.

172
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,700
 He's in prison.

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,980
 He's like in his 70s.

174
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,020
 So I don't think he's kicking it around in my neighborhood.

175
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,500
 But so yeah, weird.

176
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,340
 I'll keep you updated.

177
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,420
 I'll tell you this right now.

178
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,900
 There's probably no ending to the story.

179
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,380
 I'm probably not gonna come back a week from now

180
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,540
 and being like, "I was being chased by guys in cloaks."

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,420
 Or, "This woman went missing."

182
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,740
 To be honest, it probably is just a weird series

183
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,500
 of coincidences, but I will keep you guys updated.

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,820
 I wanted to go ahead and share that story with you.

185
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,780
 It's kind of different than what I normally show.

186
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,860
 It kind of falls into my personal experience,

187
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,380
 ghost story type things.

188
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,060
 And I kind of prefer to cover stuff

189
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,380
 that I can show you articles and verify,

190
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,980
 but I'm gonna post the photo of the photo.

191
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,780
 And I'll post a copy of the other photo

192
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,420
 of the young woman that I think this photo is emulating

193
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,820
 and we'll go from there.

194
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,180
 Okay, so let's go ahead.

195
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,900
 I didn't plan on doing that, but I was like,

196
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,020
 'cause that actually just happened today

197
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,460
 where I found the photo.

198
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,340
 And I was like, "Oh, we'll do it later."

199
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,980
 But no, I'm glad we did it today.

200
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,500
 So, and I know no one's gonna believe me, but anyway,

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,420
 so let's get, and that's fine.

202
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,260
 That's fine.

203
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,100
 I don't, yeah.

204
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,460
 It's good to be skeptical, even of me.

205
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,500
 Never heard to be skeptical of anybody.

206
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 So, but it is true.

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,020
 So anyways, okay, and we're back.

208
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,060
 Actually, I took a bit of a break there.

209
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,900
 I talked to it.

210
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,820
 This next story I went on for like 20 minutes talking about.

211
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
 I think it's an interesting story.

212
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,300
 I don't know if it's 20 minutes interesting.

213
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
 And I said it'd be easier for me to just rerecord it

214
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,180
 than to have to edit it down.

215
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,620
 So I do think it's definitely an interesting story,

216
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,780
 but I talked about it way too long.

217
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,700
 What we're gonna do is we're going back in time

218
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,860
 to the late 1800s.

219
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,340
 So we're after the Civil War, we're in the United States.

220
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,380
 We're in the South.

221
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,180
 And there was a man who was known as Railroad Bill.

222
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,020
 So Railroad Bill is half factual, half legend.

223
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,140
 Maybe the legends are true.

224
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,980
 I don't know.

225
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,140
 We'll explore that in a bit.

226
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,740
 But Railroad Bill was just a normal dude.

227
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,200
 Well, he's a little more than normal

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,420
 because nobody knew anything about him.

229
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,060
 He just kind of popped up in the area.

230
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,900
 We don't know anything about his childhood

231
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,740
 or where he came from.

232
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,940
 And even people there, they weren't too familiar

233
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,980
 with who he was.

234
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,100
 He went by the name of Morris Slater.

235
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,500
 But even then it seemed like

236
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,780
 that may not have actually been his real name.

237
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,460
 People stories go that he originally started off

238
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,900
 as a circus performer

239
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,160
 and ended up getting a job at a Turpentine company,

240
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,220
 which I guess somebody has to manufacture Turpentine.

241
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,860
 Turpentine is paint remover.

242
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,260
 It's most popularly known as the dip that Judge Doom

243
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,100
 put shoes in.

244
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,140
 I'm sure a painter will be like,

245
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,660
 "No, it's more popularly known,

246
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,340
 "popularly known as paint remover."

247
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,960
 But anyways, worked at a Turpentine company.

248
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,220
 He also enjoyed riding the rails.

249
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,380
 So there was a rail company back in the day called Louisey.

250
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,060
 They weren't really good with names back then.

251
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,140
 This railroad company was called,

252
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,660
 this railroad company was called Louisville

253
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,940
 and Nashville Railroad.

254
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,300
 So again, like, yeah,

255
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,180
 you're just kind of describing what it is.

256
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,300
 He hitches a ride on the rail.

257
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,700
 The breakman on the train finds him

258
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,120
 and picks him up and throws him off the train.

259
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
 And from this event, railroad bill vowed vengeance

260
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,660
 on the train company.

261
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,320
 But anyways, then this breakman throws him off the train

262
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,200
 and he like falls into the dirt.

263
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,820
 And most people's first reaction would be like,

264
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,720
 "Whoa, I'm glad I didn't get mangled horribly by the train."

265
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,820
 Railroad bill's first reaction is to pull out his rifle,

266
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,360
 which he somehow kept a hold of.

267
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
 If I was throwing it off a train,

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I wouldn't then be like,

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,200
 "And take your rifle with you."

270
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
 But anyways, railroad bill takes out his rifle

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,840
 and opens fire on the breakman.

272
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
 Train just keeps on chugging along.

273
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,400
 From that day, railroad bill vowed vengeance

274
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,500
 on the train company.

275
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,820
 Now getting thrown off a train

276
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,660
 isn't the easiest thing to endure,

277
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,060
 but railroad bill made it his life mission

278
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,020
 to go after the train company.

279
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,060
 Actually quit his job at the Turpentine company.

280
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,020
 He's like, "You can kill tunes on your own."

281
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,020
 And formed a gang that then hijacked trains and robbed them.

282
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,060
 And what they would do is they would put one guy

283
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,780
 on the train, they would hide a guy on the train

284
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,200
 and be like, "Tip one, don't get thrown off."

285
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,660
 But they would put a guy on the train.

286
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,220
 And when the train would kind of be out in the middle

287
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,920
 of nowhere, the dude would open the door out

288
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,120
 and throw all the goods out of the train.

289
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,620
 The story goes that railroad bill would then get the goods,

290
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,280
 get the contraband.

291
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
 Is it contraband?

292
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,240
 Well, he would get the stolen property

293
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
 and then give it to the poor.

294
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
 He hated the railroad so much,

295
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,520
 he's like, "I don't even want to make money from this.

296
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,360
 I'm just gonna give all this stuff to the poor."

297
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,280
 So the people in the area saw him as like a folk hero,

298
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,080
 as a real Robin Hood type guy.

299
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,840
 He also, this is why, the story is true crime-ish,

300
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,640
 but the reason why I'm covering it,

301
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,620
 I came across this in that great book

302
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,700
 that I love, National Jerk Crew of Haunted Places.

303
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,940
 There'll be a link below if you wanna buy the book yourself,

304
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,660
 and which I highly recommend everyone doing.

305
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,780
 And it is affiliate links,

306
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,140
 so when you buy something, I get a little bit,

307
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,940
 but still, I highly recommend everyone getting this book.

308
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,980
 He had, the rumor goes that he actually had

309
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,620
 the power to shape shift.

310
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,620
 And he could assume either the form of a big black dog

311
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,420
 or any inanimate object.

312
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,020
 Now, if I had a choice between becoming like,

313
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,880
 yeah, being a big black dog helps you run around

314
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,720
 and menace people, but if I can become any inanimate object,

315
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
 I would just become a $100 bill.

316
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,480
 And then have my buddy, which back then was a ton of money,

317
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
 have a buddy buy stuff, and then the hand over the $100 bill,

318
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
 and they don't notice the little picture of the guy

319
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,200
 like, "Winking" at the get, at that,

320
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
 is a accomplice going, "Wink!"

321
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
 And then after they get the goods,

322
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,480
 he can turn back into a human and run out the back door.

323
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,760
 That's how I would rob stuff

324
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,880
 if I could turn into inanimate objects.

325
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,080
 But anyways, I wonder if you turned into a stage coach

326
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,140
 and people were inside you, would that be comfortable?

327
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,060
 They're like, it's just like an eight month ride

328
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,580
 through the wilderness.

329
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,500
 But anyways, so, well, if you turn into a stage coach,

330
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,480
 is that inanimate?

331
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,180
 Technically, the coach part is you'd have to get

332
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,100
 some wheels put on you.

333
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,340
 But anyways, so railroad bill could turn

334
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,260
 into an inanimate object or a big black dog.

335
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,540
 And that's the legend.

336
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,820
 The reason why that legend grew

337
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,340
 was because they could not catch this guy.

338
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,580
 First off, there was a $350 reward,

339
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,080
 which again, is a ton of money back then.

340
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,160
 And as his crime spree progressed, at one point,

341
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,040
 okay, at one point he was fell asleep

342
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 behind a water tower along these train tracks.

343
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,920
 These train employees found him.

344
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,000
 They grabbed his rifle, they grabbed his pistol,

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
 and then woke him up.

346
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,040
 They're like, "Get up, get up, railroad bill,

347
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
 we're assuming 'cause you're by railroad."

348
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,320
 Railroad bill jumps up, sprints 100 yards,

349
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,960
 pulls out another gun he had hidden

350
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
 and starts a gun battle.

351
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
 And the dudes weren't prepared for that.

352
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,460
 They had to hide in this little shed

353
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,580
 and he's like shooting in the shed.

354
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
 (imitates gun shooting)

355
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,900
 And the other guys are like, "Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft,

356
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,740
 shooting."

357
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,340
 And around that time, this is just luck,

358
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,380
 this isn't supernatural, a train pulls up to the water tower.

359
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,340
 Railroad bill jumps in the train,

360
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,220
 hijacks it to make his getaway.

361
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,860
 But he hated the train company so much,

362
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,660
 he drove the train about 200 yards, stopped it,

363
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,380
 got off the train and started another gun battle

364
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,940
 with the people in the shed.

365
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,340
 And he kept shooting at them until he ran out of ammo

366
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,620
 and then just took off.

367
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,120
 Eventually, more law enforcement got called in,

368
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
 a sheriff was killed.

369
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
 At that point, the reward was raised to $1,250,

370
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,120
 which in today's money was $34,000.

371
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,960
 So everyone was out looking for this guy.

372
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,620
 You had Pinkerton detectives, you had vigilantes,

373
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,320
 bounty hunters, law enforcement, railroad officials,

374
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
 just normal dudes or shotguns.

375
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,960
 He ends up getting cornered in a swamp

376
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,760
 and a hundred men are on his tail.

377
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,600
 Now these are all different groups.

378
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,480
 So some of them are gonna be expert trackers,

379
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,500
 some of them are just gonna be moonshine people.

380
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
 Not like they're made of moonshine,

381
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,780
 but you know, like people who drink a lot of moonshine.

382
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,580
 It's much easier to evade one group of people

383
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,500
 that are working as a group than it is to have to outrun

384
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,340
 basically a hundred different battle plans.

385
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,900
 Every group's searching for him on his own.

386
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,500
 For five days, he evades them in the swamp.

387
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,860
 And that's again why people are like,

388
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,780
 yep, told ya, he's a shapeshifter.

389
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,140
 I can imagine like these hillbillies

390
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,520
 walking through a swamp looking for this dude.

391
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,560
 And there's just this giant tree there

392
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
 with like these cartoon eyes,

393
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,600
 just like looking at him and he's like (laughs)

394
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,440
 and then once they leave,

395
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,080
 he turns back into a human and runs away.

396
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,960
 Or he like turns into a frog.

397
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,560
 I guess it's not an animated object.

398
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,400
 He turns into a frog that doesn't move.

399
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,480
 So that's an animate.

400
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,640
 It kind of probably pushed in the boundaries there.

401
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,400
 But anyway, so he does all this stuff.

402
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,360
 He eventually does meet his end.

403
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,500
 He's at like a convenience store, like an old timey shop.

404
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,100
 And two different teams of vigilantes

405
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,580
 come at the same time and they riddle him full of bullets

406
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,420
 and he dies.

407
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,260
 And you go, well, that's proof that he's not a shapeshifter.

408
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,020
 However, I will argue that maybe he's simply shapeshifted

409
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,620
 into a dead body to keep everyone.

410
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,540
 That's an animate, right?

411
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,380
 And then afterwards he jumped out of his grave.

412
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,860
 Actually, I know for a fact that's not true

413
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,220
 'cause his body was on display for so long

414
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,220
 in so many different cities that judges had to say,

415
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,620
 you can't, you have to stop displaying this guy's body.

416
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,240
 He was that big of a local legend, that big of an outlaw.

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,840
 The people loved him, law enforcement hated him.

418
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,320
 Whether or not he was a shapeshifter

419
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,600
 is definitely up for debate.

420
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,820
 I'd like to think that he was.

421
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,600
 I think that makes the world more interesting.

422
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,560
 He should have shapeshifted into a bulletproof vest

423
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,600
 at the end, but anyways, so again,

424
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,720
 he was such a local figure that they're actually,

425
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,960
 I believe it was in the 20s, they wrote a ballot

426
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,240
 for railroad bill, little ballot.

427
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,560
 And I'm going to sing a part of it for you.

428
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,980
 Now I can't play it for you because copyright,

429
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,900
 even though it was in the 1920s,

430
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,260
 the only recording I have is copyrighted,

431
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,940
 but the lyrics themselves are not copyrighted.

432
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,380
 Railroad bill up on a hill,

433
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,580
 light and cigar with the $10 bill.

434
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,580
 Now, before you criticize the lyrics,

435
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,380
 again, this is an old timey song.

436
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,660
 So it's not like these guys are coming out

437
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,500
 with their A game.

438
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,780
 This people are like, damn, he rhymed hill with bill

439
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,980
 and bill again.

440
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,280
 But anyways, railroad bill up on a hill,

441
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
 light and cigar with the $10 bill.

442
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,760
 Railroad bill took my wife,

443
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,440
 if I don't like it, gonna take my life.

444
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,680
 Not only is he a shapeshifter,

445
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,560
 not only is he a train bandit,

446
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,000
 not only is he a, well, not modern day Robin Hood,

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
 but not only is he an American Robin Hood,

448
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,800
 he also cucks you.

449
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,960
 Yep, so that's the story of railroad bill.

450
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,040
 Now imagine that story I just told you,

451
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,900
 it expounded to 20 minutes

452
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,180
 and you'll understand why I cut out a bunch of stuff.

453
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,100
 And also I went on too long talking about that.

454
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,340
 I can't, I didn't have room to talk about our next story.

455
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,580
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

456
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,700
 We're going to England.

457
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300
 We spent a lot of time in England.

458
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,500
 We spent a lot of time in South America

459
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,140
 and we've spent a lot of time in England.

460
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,660
 I'd like to do some more like Australia,

461
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,700
 Eastern European stuff, African stuff.

462
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,060
 We spent a little bit of time in Africa.

463
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,300
 Crazy Cryptid Week was there,

464
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,260
 but now we're back in England

465
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,600
 and we're going a little bit back in time here,

466
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,760
 which tends to happen.

467
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,200
 I don't know, every time I go to England

468
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,100
 I get caught in some sort of time warp.

469
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,520
 1920s.

470
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,480
 Now in Gillingham, England,

471
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
 which is in the states,

472
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,800
 they don't call them states over there or whatever.

473
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,440
 They call them like, the cities are called shires

474
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,080
 and the states are called counties or something like that.

475
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,680
 But anyways, in the shire of,

476
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,020
 and someone's like totally like,

477
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,800
 no, that's not true at all,

478
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,840
 but in the shire slash town of Gillingham,

479
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,300
 in the 1920s, they had the Gillingham Fair

480
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,340
 and one of the highlights of the Gillingham Fair was,

481
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,660
 they would build this three story structure

482
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,900
 out of wood and canvas.

483
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,020
 And you're thinking, that seems incredibly dangerous.

484
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,260
 That seems very flammable.

485
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,100
 Uh-huh.

486
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,180
 So they built this three story structure

487
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,460
 out of wood and canvas

488
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,500
 and it was for a firefighters demonstration.

489
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,620
 And they had this thing.

490
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,420
 It's called the bridal party rescue.

491
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,740
 I don't know if that's what it's actually called,

492
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,700
 but that's what we're gonna call it.

493
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,140
 They had this event that was a bridal party rescue

494
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,860
 where you had two firefighters

495
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,160
 who would act as newlyweds.

496
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,760
 So they'd go up there.

497
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,680
 I don't know if they put on tuxes and wedding dresses

498
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,640
 'cause they're both dudes 'cause this is the 1920s,

499
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,280
 but anyways, they go up there

500
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
 and they have a bridal party

501
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
 and they're in the structure.

502
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,720
 And this is out of fair.

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 So people are watching this.

504
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 Like you have this huge crowd watching this event.

505
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,140
 And then you have flares go off and smoke go off

506
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,240
 and everyone goes, oh no, help me, help me,

507
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
 firemen of Gillingham.

508
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,240
 And the firefighters come

509
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,720
 and they bring out their ladders

510
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,560
 and they rescue the people out of the structure

511
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,800
 and everyone claps and they're like,

512
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,860
 oh, these are very efficient firemen.

513
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,140
 And then they start a real fire

514
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,620
 and they burn the structure down

515
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,940
 and they just put it out with their hoses.

516
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,980
 And everyone would be like, yay.

517
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,220
 There's nothing else to do back then.

518
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,940
 I mean, like that was the highlight of your year

519
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,340
 when you got to see that happen.

520
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,620
 And went off without a hitch, quite a while.

521
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,060
 But eventually there was a hitch.

522
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,740
 So you know where this story's going in 1929.

523
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,180
 So now we're on July 11th, 1929.

524
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,700
 It's fair time.

525
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,540
 Everyone's like, oh dude,

526
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,460
 are you gonna go see the canvas structure burned?

527
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,520
 Oh yeah, totally, man.

528
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
 Of course I'm gonna see the canvas structure burned down.

529
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,900
 That's all I'm gonna do this year.

530
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,160
 So they go out there.

531
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,800
 And for this bridal party this time,

532
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,920
 you had nine boys and six men.

533
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,880
 So you had two of them or the bride in the groom

534
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
 and the rest of the people were pretending

535
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,640
 to be the wedding guests.

536
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,280
 And for what, and this is where the story goes weird

537
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,480
 and we're gonna explore this more.

538
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,520
 But for whatever reason,

539
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,100
 the smoke bombs and the flares, they don't go off.

540
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
 Instead, the second stage starts.

541
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,820
 So this people are in this building.

542
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,860
 You have a total of 15 people here.

543
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,100
 The fire starts.

544
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,660
 Now that's supposed to happen

545
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,300
 after everyone's out of the building.

546
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,620
 Again, it's three stories.

547
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,740
 It's 40 feet tall and it catches on fire.

548
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,960
 Now it doesn't take a rocket science to know

549
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,980
 that canvas and wood are incredibly flammable.

550
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,000
 The building just ignites.

551
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,540
 Now the firefighters on the scene, on the ground,

552
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,340
 who were there to be there to do the mock rescue

553
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,820
 and then put the fire out afterwards,

554
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,140
 they realize immediately what's going on.

555
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,300
 They just flameshoot out the building.

556
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,660
 They look at each other, drop their tea and crumpets,

557
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,700
 grab their gear and start trying to put out the fire.

558
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,620
 But the audience thinks that it's part of the show.

559
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,740
 They're like, man, special effects

560
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,860
 have gotten really good this year.

561
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,880
 Normally there's just smoke coming out of the windows,

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,140
 but look at those flames go.

563
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,300
 The audience is cheering at this fire.

564
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,800
 The people in the building are screaming for help.

565
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,320
 They immediately know that things have gone sideways.

566
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,920
 'Cause some of the adults in the building are firefighters.

567
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,520
 They immediately begin screaming for help

568
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,560
 and the audience is now even clapping even harder.

569
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,160
 They're like, this is the best performance

570
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
 those people have ever given.

571
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,260
 Normally they're just like, help me, help me.

572
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,920
 But these guys actually seem like

573
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,440
 they're crying for their lives.

574
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,560
 This is amazing.

575
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,480
 The crowd is cheering them on.

576
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
 Firefighters are probably just like, shut up.

577
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,560
 Actually, the firefighters probably didn't even hear him.

578
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,940
 They're just blasting this thing with water.

579
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,600
 And the audience continued to applaud

580
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,320
 until the first boy jumped off the top of the building

581
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,400
 on fire, smashed into the ground.

582
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,120
 And the audience is kind of like slowly stopped clapping.

583
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,760
 They're watching this and then another boy

584
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,000
 jumps out of the building on fire,

585
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
 crashes into the ground.

586
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
 Of the people who were there,

587
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
 so there was 15 people in the building,

588
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,360
 of the people who were there,

589
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,280
 13 of them died at the scene.

590
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,480
 Horribly burned, choked out on smoke.

591
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,860
 Two of them leapt to their deaths on fire.

592
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,420
 Two were severely injured and then they died later.

593
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,580
 So out of the 15 people in the building, all 15 died.

594
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,020
 They don't know how the fire started.

595
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,220
 They don't know who started the fire.

596
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,900
 They don't know what happened at the event.

597
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,740
 They just know it was this horrible tragedy.

598
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,220
 Basically the city shut down.

599
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,300
 There was this huge funeral.

600
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,740
 They're all buried in the same location.

601
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,420
 So I read about that event.

602
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,060
 And I was like, that's just a tragic event.

603
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,160
 But what's weird, it is weird that all this time

604
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,440
 we don't know who started the fire.

605
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,760
 Like you think that would be one detail you would know.

606
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,840
 Cause there's someone's job was to start the fire.

607
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,680
 Cause they're firemen.

608
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
 They're not like mucking about.

609
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,480
 They're not just like throwing matches and stuff

610
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
 waiting to go off.

611
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,480
 They're very controlled to burn.

612
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,360
 But no firefighter was ever accused

613
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,800
 or brought to trial or anything like that.

614
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,080
 The fire just started.

615
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,960
 And you go, okay, just a tragic coincidence,

616
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,160
 technological failure, whatever.

617
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,920
 22 years later in the same town,

618
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,960
 Shire of Gillingham,

619
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,820
 there was a bus and a street light.

620
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,700
 Out of all the street lights in the world

621
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,540
 that could have went out,

622
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,620
 one street light goes off.

623
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,420
 A year old bus drivers driving down the road.

624
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,380
 This bus driver worked for a company

625
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,820
 called the Chatham and District Traction Company.

626
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,180
 They needed a, somebody's invented a time machine

627
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,580
 and go back in time and teach people how to name stuff.

628
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,460
 The Chatham and District Traction Company,

629
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,780
 which you can actually shorten district traction

630
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,280
 to distraction, oddly enough.

631
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,960
 Street lights out, bus drivers going down the road.

632
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,940
 Now normally it wouldn't be a huge issue,

633
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,040
 but something else was going on in the street.

634
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,980
 And also the bus driver did had his side lights on,

635
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,220
 but he didn't have his headlights on,

636
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,880
 which was actually at the time totally legal.

637
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,260
 You didn't have to drive their headlights on.

638
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,000
 And this was later, obviously,

639
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,340
 and that's why the street light being out

640
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,960
 and him not having headlights on is an issue.

641
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,220
 While he's driving this bus down the road,

642
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,500
 there is a march.

643
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 There is a parade of 52 young kids

644
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,860
 of the Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps

645
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,420
 between the ages of nine and 13,

646
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,620
 marching down the street in their nice little uniforms.

647
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,960
 They're dark uniforms, that doesn't help.

648
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,340
 He doesn't see them with the street light being out

649
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,620
 and him not having any headlights.

650
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
 He plows into them.

651
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,980
 The bus driver didn't even know he hit him.

652
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,340
 It was a double-decker bus and they're little kids.

653
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,460
 So it's tragic as that is.

654
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,940
 I mean, it's be hard to see.

655
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,020
 He runs over him and he doesn't even realize

656
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,860
 that he has hit anything until he started

657
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,340
 to feel the car wobbling like he was driving

658
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,080
 over loose stones, which would have been bodies

659
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,940
 caught up in the wheels.

660
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,140
 Witnesses at the scene say, "We don't believe that

661
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,100
 because the minute he impacted them,

662
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,820
 you just hear it screaming everywhere."

663
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,460
 They believe that he knew much quicker

664
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,540
 that he had hit these kids

665
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,460
 and for whatever reason kept going.

666
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,540
 Out of the, I mean, okay, now you're driving

667
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,460
 a bus down the road and there's 52 kids marching

668
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,020
 in the intersection.

669
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,780
 You have to have, this is school shooter numbers

670
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,940
 of the damage he did.

671
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,380
 Like I imagine if a bus hits a bunch of kids

672
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,780
 at a certain point they're gonna start moving

673
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,700
 out of the way or if he hits a broadside,

674
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,500
 he's only gonna take out a chunk of them.

675
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,980
 Out of 52 kids, 24 killed, 18 injured.

676
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,820
 So more than half of the kids in that group got ran over

677
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,220
 or maybe a couple got trampled.

678
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,340
 At the time, it was the highest loss of life

679
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,300
 in any road accident in British history.

680
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 I saw both of these events and I thought, yes, coincidence.

681
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:36,540
 Both of these events relied on just a little problem.

682
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,780
 And we see that with a lot of stuff,

683
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,820
 like plane crashes, they can say it was just

684
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,380
 this one instrument or this could have been prevented

685
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,700
 if just this one little piece was in place or whatever.

686
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,500
 But it seems chilling that both of these events

687
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,100
 separated by 22 years in the same city

688
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,140
 with mass loss of life of a lot of kids

689
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,540
 both happened through happenstance.

690
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,060
 They both happened by sheer bad luck.

691
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,660
 Him not having his headlights on, like I said,

692
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,580
 that was legal at the time.

693
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,900
 So they didn't, that probably wouldn't have made an issue.

694
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,460
 But the street light going out and him running over

695
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,340
 the kids and then the light, the fire,

696
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,460
 mysteriously being set before it was supposed to

697
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,940
 and nobody was ever held accountable for that.

698
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,580
 I was looked at these two things and I thought,

699
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,500
 this sounds very like Derry, Maine.

700
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,100
 This sounds very like a Pennywise type situation.

701
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,380
 And I started, no, again, a lot of times people go,

702
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,880
 man, you're really skeptical.

703
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,340
 But I don't always start off like that.

704
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
 So with this, I go, they were 22 years apart.

705
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,820
 Let's see what happened 22 years after the bus accident.

706
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,860
 Let's see what happened 22 years before the Gillingham fire.

707
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,940
 Like I tried to look for some sort of pattern,

708
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,500
 some sort of Pennywise style pattern.

709
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,800
 I couldn't find any, to be fair.

710
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,720
 But it does seem in that short amount of time

711
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,940
 that all these kids were killed,

712
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,420
 it really does give the two stories a connected,

713
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,700
 really creepy vibe.

714
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,420
 And not only were mass amounts of kids killed,

715
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,220
 but the way they were killed was terribly brutal.

716
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,300
 Is it possible that the town of Gillingham

717
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,200
 is powering itself from the torment and death of children?

718
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,020
 If I wanted a liable lawsuit, I would say definitely.

719
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,540
 If I wanted to be skeptical about it, I'd say no,

720
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,660
 they're just two tragic events in the same area.

721
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,860
 And you can look all over the world

722
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,420
 for tragic events in the same area

723
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,780
 and they may meet some sort of pattern.

724
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,660
 But there's a part of me that thinks

725
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,420
 that there's something a little more creepy going on there.

726
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,900
 I have no proof of that.

727
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,600
 And it hasn't been replicated.

728
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,500
 I can't prove it.

729
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,860
 I just get it, it just gives me a creepy feeling,

730
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
 a creepy hunch that there is something there.

731
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,500
 Or more importantly, there was something there

732
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,340
 that made these events happen.

733
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,440
 I have no proof of that whatsoever.

734
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,680
 At all, just a hunch.

735
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,360
 But sometimes a hunch is all you really have.

736
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,620
