1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Vampire Week ends with two vampiric stories. You're like Vampire Week, I didn't know what you're doing that. Well, we were.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 First off, we take a look at a man who can promise you, today, that he can make you a vampire for $500.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And then we travel to Mexico to look at a vampire legend that is so obscure most Mexicans have never ever heard of it before.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Even though this vampire kills a baby every month. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 [Laughs]

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Welcome back to another devilish episode of Dead...

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Never mind, I'm not gonna do that.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 It's Friday! That sounded... that sounded oddly weird. I've never done that before.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's Friday, I'll say it in a deeper, more serious voice.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend. Don't forget, we are doing our six weeks to a better you.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Now it's five weeks to a better you.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 June 15th, let's get some goals accomplished.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Last week, I cut down my calories, 'cause I'm all about my fitness right now.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I cut 900 calories out of my daily life. I feel great. I'm losing weight. I'm lifting.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Let's see how better your life can be. June 15th.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You're like, dude, it is creeping up very rapidly.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But remember, last week, six weeks to a better you.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I wanna see you at a better place in life. I'm gonna be in a better place in life.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We're all going to be four more awesome than we were on May 1st. Come June 15th.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move. You're like, dude, I didn't know I was gonna have so much pressure.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I just wanted to hear a ghost story or a vampire story during Vampire Week.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 That I just announced. I was doing vampire stories a lot this week, but I didn't want to make it a vampire week.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 'Cause I don't think I talked about them on Wednesday or something like that.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But anyways, we are going to take a look at some vampires.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 First off, we're gonna say thank you to one of our legacy Patreons, Ivan M.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Ivan, thank you so much for supporting the show. That really, really helps a lot.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 You are gonna be our captain for this episode.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, you know what I'm gonna say. That's fine too.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So Ivan, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonicopter. We are flying out to India.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Because that is where this seems to be centered.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We're flying out to India. You're like, Jason, that's a super big country.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 You just can't say, "Next stop, India." Like, I have to have directions. Ivan, Ivan, okay.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And I don't know the specifics. Ivan, just fly, just hover around India for a while.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 We'll figure it out. Because apparently, you actually may have encountered one of these.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 There is a post that's floating around the internet.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Some people may say it's copypasta. Some people may say it's creepypasta.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Some people may say it's a scam. Here we go.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 This is on, this was posted, the original time I saw it, this was posted on the Facebook page.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 For the South Atlantic news agency, it's written by a man named Keith Braden.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Keith Braden writes this. And it is broken English, so we're just gonna have to straddle through a bit of this.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 "I'm a vampire." And I know you will be surprised to think that.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 How I can write articles on the site if I'm a vampire. I am quite shocked.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I didn't know vampires could use computers, but Keith proved me wrong.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Here we continue. "I can change anytime, any day to either human or vampire."

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Yes, it is true. How I become a vampire with the help of the Hindu priest.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And then he has this helpful email address, "Vampire Lord Transformer Changing@gmail.com."

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 That's very nice. I thought they might have their own server, you know, being undead creatures that feed on humans.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 But nope, just Gmail. If you want to write that down, it's vampirelordtransformerchanging@gmail.com.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He goes on to say that technically he's a demon called a Pisatch. A Pisatch?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's like an Indian version, an East Asian version of the vampire.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 It's a far cry from Twilight. If you want to meet up with this dude, want him to turn into a vampire,

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 just let you know they don't necessarily drink human blood, they eat flesh, that's a huge difference, right?

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 There is something romantic about the young maiden being in her bedroom. She's combing her hair.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 The windows open. Someone crawls through the window.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Okay, so it's less romantic when you start to think about the real world applications of it.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 But in old timey England, instead of like some creepy dude crawling through your bedroom window, it's mist.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's not creepy, right? It's mist.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And the woman's combing her long brown hair. I picture her looking like that chick from the Phantom of the Opera.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Christine Diaye, she's combing her hair. And then the mist forms behind her.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And it's a handsome pale man with fangs. But she doesn't see, see, 'cause she's in the mirror.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But her blood gets cold. And she feels the hairs on the back of her neck stick up one by one.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 The chill moves. It moves through her soul.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 She wants to turn around, but she doesn't. She wants to scream, but she hopes that he stays.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 The vampire bears his fangs and she feels his warm breath on her naked neck.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's hot, right? Now, let me retell that story with this dude's version of the vampire.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Chicks combing her hair. Dude breaks in the window. Eats her flesh.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 That's not romantic. That's not hot. And you're like, "Jayson, neither was the other one." Because the other one was borderline.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It was borderline, but at least the girl's flesh was still there, right? She just got a little puncture mark on her neck.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Also, these guys bulging veins, red eyeballs. Yeah, you're not Edward.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 You can email Transformer--what was it? Vampire Lord TransformerChangingGmail.com.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Do not expect that you're gonna look like Brad Pitt.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 You might look like Brad Pitt after he's been on Mars with no space suit for a while, but no, otherwise you will not look like Brad Pitt.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But before you email this guy, he has some more information for you.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 He says, "I will not tell you my exact location, but I will tell you how to become a vampire. My English is not so good, so excuse me."

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's weird that he's mentioning that now. So we get it, dude.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I wasn't reading the rest of this email being like, "Is there something wrong with my eyes? Do I have late onset dyslexia?"

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Oh, English isn't his first language. Sorry, I should have figured that out.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Myself, the five previous paragraphs. But you're thinking, "Jayson, are you making fun of this guy because he can't?"

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 No, I don't have a problem that he has a hard time writing English, but that's--so the joke isn't that.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 That's a clue, actually. That's a clue.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So he says, "My English is not so good, so excuse me." And then he goes on, "If you become a vampire, you can still be an ordinary man, but you will get more power."

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 This is a weird set. So when you think of vampires, assuming you're not thinking of a flesh-eating vampire, if you're thinking of regular vampires,

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 what's the power set you think of? If you're trying to imagine yourself as a vampire, what would you, you know, fly?

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Obviously, for me, turning into a mison going into Christine Diaye's bedroom, what was the power set?

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 This is what he--this is his pitch to us before we emailed vampire lore transformer changing.

90
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 "If you become a vampire, you can still be an ordinary man, but you will get more power."

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Okay, that's cool.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 "And gain more height."

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I never thought of vampires as particularly tall.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 If honestly, I think I've always imagined vampires to be, like, normal height?

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like, not super tall or super short, just kind of like a dude floating around?

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 I've never thought of, "Oh, no, look at, like, I've never seen a basketball player and be like, 'Yep, he's probably a vampire.'"

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Like, I've never concluded those two.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But apparently, that's what this guy wants. We go on.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 "You will become much younger than your mates of the same age." I have no idea what that means.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Me and my buddies are all 23. I get--I become a flesh-eating demon.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I'm a foot taller, and now I look like I'm 16? Like, I don't get that.

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "If we're all the same age, how can I become younger than them?"

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Wouldn't I just become younger in general?

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But anyways, anyways, the powers of the Dark Lords confound us all.

105
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 "You will never become bald, as well."

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Which is interesting, because if you're already bald, how does that work? Do you grow hair?

107
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 But I don't know.

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I guess if you're a flesh-eating demon with bulging veins and giant red eyes,

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I'm sure you can grow some follicles.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And--so you're saying, "Jason, Jason, you're nitpicking. You're being a nitpicker."

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Who doesn't want to be a little bit taller? Who doesn't want to be a little bit younger?

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Who doesn't want to have a full head of hair? Fair, fair.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Your mileage may vary on that. But then we get to the last line.

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 But you already became one of these vampires. You already sold it, so you're taller, you're younger,

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 you have a head full of hair, and here's--this is not a selling point, guys.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 What he's trying to do is he's trying to get money from us. Apparently, if you email

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 VampireLordTransformerChanging@gmail.com, he'll ask you for $500 for a vial of his blood,

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 which you are then to drink, and then you become a vampire.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Now, that's disgusting, and it's--most likely break several biomedical waste laws.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But apparently, you send the $500 and you never get the blood.

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And then they add, "Oh, it's caught up in customs. You know those anti-vampire people working at ICE?

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Stop everything." So then you send them another $500 and you never hear from them again.

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But, Keith Braden goes on to say, "You're gonna get more power, you're gonna get taller,

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 you're not gonna be bald anymore, and here's the last part. You don't need any sex.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 You will always satisfied."

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So what are you supposed to do? You're taller, you're powerful, you're younger, you have a head full of hair,

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 and you can't use any of that to get a chick?

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So, if you're as if I'm taller, if just dudes are like, "Hey, you're tall," it doesn't make any sense.

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So anyways, and I don't even understand, you will always--you will always satisfied.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So does that mean you're just constantly walking around in a constant state of orgasm?

131
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You don't need any sex because every waking moment of your life, which that would get old quick, right?

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But anyways, I could go on and on with this guy's ridiculous email.

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 He does direct us to go to a website called howtobcomearillvampire.weebly.com

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 because again, if you are one of the forsaken souls trapped between damnation and paradise,

135
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 you're gonna use Weebly, right? You're gonna use a pre-formatted website.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It's defunct. You go there, there's nothing there. Apparently, the ancient ones can't pay their $6.99 ISP hosting bill.

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But here's the thing, I could go on and on. That was posted back on October 23rd, 2015 by a guy named Keith Braden.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Now, there's tons of these out there. I found one from someone named Roland,

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 and he talks about how he wanted to become a vampire, and he got his from Vampires Creed Lodge at gmail.com.

140
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And then his girlfriend Vicky shows up, or Victoria, I guess, it's just, I shouldn't be that familiar with her, I've never met her.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 But she also talks about another place. She also talks about Vampires Creed,

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 and that's where she names specifically its $500 to get the blood and everything like that.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And they got it, and it took them 30 minutes, and they became vampires.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And then I found this one. This one, those were published in 2017.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 The first one I went over, Keith Braden won. That was October 23rd, 2015.

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So this has been going on for a couple of years. Listen to this one. This one's from 2016.

147
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Being a vampire has certain limitations, but it can also be a ton of fun.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Your extra strengths and abilities can make you successful in almost every endeavor you participated.

149
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And before you know it, the money and acquaintances will come streaming in.

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 That's a good sales pitch. That's a really, really good sales pitch.

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 This was, I don't remember exactly what website I found this on, but this was in 2016.

152
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You can build wealth and gain prestige and notoriety, and attempt things you may never have considered as a human.

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 One thing you will definitely have more of is time.

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Beef up your education and learn all you wanted to. Travel the world to see things most people only ever see on TV.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This is, again, a really, really good sales pitch. This is starting to make me want to eat human flesh.

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 This is going to be especially fun if you turn to share your life with one of us.

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Let us show you the wonders of the world. Learn new languages, go skydiving or scuba dive with the sharks.

158
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Visit the African safari. You no longer need to be scared of nature or wildlife.

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 You will have become the world's strongest predator. Have fun with it.

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And your life as a vampire can be more fulfilling than you ever dreamed.

161
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Explore, experiment, experience, and get excited.

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 There's a big world out there with lots to see and do, and as a vampire, you can do it all.

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 If willing and ever ready to be a full-blooded vampire with powers and mighty great skills,

164
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 then these is the opportunity for you to get transformed and turned into a vampire.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And then he gives you a couple emails you can contact. It's still a scam, right?

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But he gives you an email you can contact, kathbrayden@gmail.com.

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Kathbrayden in 2015 left a barely coherent, English-ish his second language, post,

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 and yet a year later is pitching the same sales deal,

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 but speaking as if he spent the past year mastering the English language.

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It's not just the grammar works, but the imagery is evocative.

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It's not no bald, have hair, be tall. It's...

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Imagine you're in the jungle. You have nothing to fear. You are the alpha predator.

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Now it's possible the kathbrayden is just the name that different writers use to run this scam.

174
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Or... It's very interesting in this email, out of all the stuff he lists,

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 all these activities you can do as a vampire, one of them stuck out, right?

176
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Learn new languages.

177
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Is kathbrayden actually a vampire? Did we actually watch the evolution of a young man

178
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 who had just recently become a vampire? He was a native to India,

179
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 types out this email on behalf of his Lord, his vampire Lord transformer changing at gmail.com.

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And then in the year in between with his vampire skills learned English more fluently than a lot of English speakers.

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Possible it's a dumb scam email that's the most likely answer,

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 but we may have actually seen what being turned into a flesh-eating demon can do.

183
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Because if you don't need to sleep, why not learn another language in between skydiving and scuba diving?

184
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Lots of diving involved when you're a vampire, obviously. Let's go to move on to our next story.

185
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You're like, "Jason, are you seriously?" You gotta admit that's weird, right?

186
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You gotta admit that's weird.

187
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Because I've read so many of these and kathbrayden had two of them.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 One was written like a bunch of gibberish and the other one was a college level description of...

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So you know, you guys can just say, "Jason, Jason, you just spent 15 minutes talking about scam emails

190
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 and that was fine, but then when you try to convince me that someone actually turned into a vampire

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 because they can type better late, "Hey man, I'm just asking questions."

192
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I'm gonna do the conspiracy theorist thing. I'm just asking questions.

193
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Is it possible that kathbrayden really turned into a vampire and can now write incredibly well?

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Stranger things have happened. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

195
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Ivan, I want you to fire up that carbonar copter. We're headed out to Mexico.

196
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 This is an interesting one. It's one of the things I like most about cryptids and ghosts and spirits

197
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 is government involvement. But before we get to that, let's bring that carbonar copter down.

198
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 We are flying over Laxcala State in central Mexico.

199
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Most of this information I got from a website called MexicoUnexplained.com

200
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and specifically this article was written by Robert Bitto.

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So I want to give him credit. It's a really cool website. I've gotten some good stuff from there.

202
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 We're flying down low over the Laxcala State or the Tlaxa-cala State.

203
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It's one of the two. But Ivan knows where it's at. He's bringing that helicopter nice and low.

204
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 We're flying over the valley.

205
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Now this legend is so obscure. Most people in Mexico have never even heard of it.

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It predates the Spaniards coming to Mexico. It's super old.

207
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 There is a vampire known as the Tlalipuche.

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 The lali part is an Aztec word for "to illuminate".

209
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I don't know what the "puche" is. I don't know what the "puche" means.

210
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I tried to look it up and it had a bunch of urban dictionary stuff.

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 You can imagine what people refer to as a "puche".

212
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But Tlalipuche was the name for this vampire woman.

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Almost always a woman. And that's funny because last week we talked about the Korean ghost.

214
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 That's almost always a woman. And I postulated that maybe if we looked at it,

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 most ghosts are women. There's a minority of male ghosts.

216
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And I think if we looked in the world of cryptids, we may see something similar to that.

217
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And it's a witch. I don't know if witches normally are...

218
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 This is an interesting one because she kind of blurs the lines.

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It's not a witch in the sense that we think of as a witch.

220
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's a subspecies of human.

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It's a shapeshifter that you are simply born one.

222
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 But not like the old tradition where your grandmother was a witch and I'm a witch.

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And now you two are... No, you can go eight generations, zero witches born.

224
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But then you are cursed to be a Tlalipuche.

225
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You don't know it until you hit puberty.

226
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And for three days your soul leaves your body.

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And at that time the family has to come together and realize that they now have one of these wretched spirits

228
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 in their house.

229
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Now from a sociological output, that kind of makes sense that we have more female versions of these.

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 That happens at puberty. That you're starting to see these hormonal changes going on in women, young girls.

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And maybe it was just an excuse to kick them out of the house.

232
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 They're like, "Ah, get out of here. You're probably a witch.

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Kick them out of the house. Go live with someone else."

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So that's possible. But in these small villages in this central Mexican state,

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 there was a time of great fear.

236
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 When your child hits puberty, you don't know if they're going to become one of these creatures.

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Because these creatures have a power set.

238
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 The biggest one is that they're shapeshifters.

239
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Now they can shapeshift into anything.

240
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 They can shapeshift into a tick or a flea to sneak past guards.

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 They can turn into a wolf. They can turn into a larger animal.

242
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But 75% -- this is again -- now this is where we get into just bizarre myths, bizarre weirdness.

243
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 They can turn into any type of animal, and really I didn't see any limitations.

244
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 They can turn into a pail of water if they wanted to.

245
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But 75% of the time when they shapeshift, they become a turkey.

246
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And they're glowing the dark turkey.

247
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Whenever they shapeshift, they'll not just turn into a flea.

248
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 They'll turn into a glow-in-the-dark flea.

249
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So when they turn into a wolf, it's glowing. That's pretty menacing.

250
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 A glow-in-the-dark flea, you wouldn't even notice it, right?

251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Glow-in-the-dark wolf would give you nightmares. Glow-in-the-dark turkey.

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Like, I want to eat that. I would want to eat that.

253
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It just sounded curiosity to see if my poop would glow in the dark, too.

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But anyway, 75% of the time it's glow-in-the-dark turkey.

255
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Because these things can be born into any family at any given time,

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 sometimes they'll go to war with each other.

257
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 They have hunting grounds. They're solitary.

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 They do not have the whole, like, "Oh, witches unite. Let's all hold hands.

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Pray to mumra." None of that stuff.

260
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 They have hunting grounds. If two are in the same city,

261
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 one of them is either leaving or getting murdered by the opposing witch.

262
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Because they have a very, very specialized diet.

263
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Now, they're not just witches, but remember, this is Vampire Week.

264
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 They're vampire witches. They don't eat flesh, like Kate Brayden.

265
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They drink blood.

266
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 However, they have to kill a baby a month to stay alive.

267
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 That's a doomsday clock. That's a curse.

268
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That's an absolute curse.

269
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like, you know, my scenario in the beginning where, like,

270
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "Listat" is like flying through your window.

271
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Some people find that sexy.

272
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I don't know. I might if I'm a vampire.

273
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But I'm not. It's not sexy.

274
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But I haven't eaten a baby a month at all.

275
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And there's no work around to that.

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 If they go a month without eating a baby, they die.

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And you don't want to die.

278
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So they eat babies. That's horrific.

279
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 You know, when angels sitting around on Buffy being like,

280
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 "Oh, I can't. I don't want to drink human blood."

281
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 You're like, "Dude, just drink a little bit of human blood."

282
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Like, it's not going to kill you. It might kill your victim.

283
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 But, you know, just drink the blood of bad guys and stuff like that.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 There's no bad babies. There's no, like, there are no bad boy babies.

285
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Although that is the name of my new band, Bad Boy Babies.

286
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 To do the transformation, it's where they can transform their bodies,

287
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 but to do it, they have this unique ritual.

288
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 First, they have to go into their kitchen and start a fire,

289
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 which is always a bad way to start a ritual, right?

290
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 That is the reason your parents aren't kicking you out of the house

291
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 because you're a hard to handle teenager.

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's because you keep setting fires, but once a month,

293
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 you set a little fire in your kitchen and you walk into it.

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You sit down. You pull your legs off,

295
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and then you turn into a turkey and walk away.

296
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Once you're a turkey, you can shape shift into other stuff,

297
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 but then your legs are just sitting by this fire.

298
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 That makes your legs vulnerable, and sometimes people will try to destroy the legs

299
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 to prevent you from turning back into a human.

300
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But, I mean, that's just bizarre.

301
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 You're walking into a house. You're like, "Hey, has anyone seen Nancy?"

302
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 "Oh, are you kidding me?"

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 You see two legs sitting in the kitchen, the kitchen's on fire.

304
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You're like, "Guys, come on. We've got to do something about this

305
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 unholy creature living under this roof."

306
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 "But she's your daughter! I don't care."

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 "She's a turkey!"

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Okay, fine. You sit down.

309
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 You watch television for a while until you hear the turkey.

310
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You see the glow outside.

311
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I don't know why making fun of this man turkey just ain't a baby.

312
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 The guy would be like, "Oh, my daughter's coming home."

313
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 "Oh, wait, my daughter just ate someone else's daughter."

314
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But anyways, the turkey has this ritual.

315
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Well, it will find a baby in a house, and then it will have to fly.

316
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Oh, yeah, it can fly as a turkey.

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 This turkey can fly around, which, I mean, that's nothing.

318
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's already taken its legs off and glow in the dark.

319
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 I can allow a turkey to fly around.

320
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Turkey has to fly over the house, making the shape of a cross,

321
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 which is weird because normally crosses and vampires don't go well together,

322
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 but this one has to make the sign of the cross.

323
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Then it will sneak into your house.

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It's looking to eat your baby.

325
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 If it can't get into the house, that's a weird way to say that.

326
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 If it can't get into the house, it can turn into the flea or the tick

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and slide underneath your door.

328
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And once it's in your house, you're doomed.

329
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Actually, once it knows you have a baby in your house, you're already doomed.

330
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You can stay up all night long waiting for this thing,

331
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 but once it's in your house, it will release a noxious knockout gas.

332
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 [Exhales]

333
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It'll put everyone in the house to sleep, and then the turkey will walk up to the crib,

334
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 turn back into a human, now the legs are back on,

335
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and will kill your child and then sneak out.

336
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 If you are able to prevent it from getting in the house,

337
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 because it's interesting, even though this story predates the Spaniards,

338
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 it has a connection to Western vampires.

339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Garlic keeps it away.

340
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You can put a steak through its heart, wooden steak through its heart to kill it.

341
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 You have to get pretty close to it, though, obviously, to do that.

342
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Which you could say that's cultural contamination from the West,

343
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 or you could say that those things actually do affect vampiric life forms,

344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 and that's why you can have a culture, an ocean away that has similar things.

345
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But anyways, you can stick a steak through its heart if you get close enough,

346
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 but it also can turn into anything.

347
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 If you're able to keep it out of your house,

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 a lot of times it will then destroy your crops.

349
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It will transform into a wolf and eat your cows,

350
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 or transform into a donkey and step all over your crops,

351
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 which technically you could probably do that as a wolf or even a flying turkey.

352
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 But it will just-- basically it's coming for your kid,

353
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 and it has to eat a kid a month.

354
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And if it can't eat your kid, if you're able to keep it away, it will destroy everything.

355
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Now this thing-- there's a great scene in the original Alien where they're talking about

356
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 the xenomorph they find it has acid for blood,

357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 and one of the characters goes, "It's a hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it."

358
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And that's true.

359
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Something that actually can do more damage as it's dying is--

360
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 that's an amazing defense mechanism.

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 This thing-- this thing gives the xenomorph a run for its money.

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 This thing also has some hilarious ways to kill it, though.

363
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 One of the things I always joke about cryptids where I'm like,

364
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "Oh yeah, you know, and there's this cryptid in Brazil.

365
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Like if you-- if it's coming at you, you don't show your shiny teeth,

366
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 or you lay on the ground, and it pa-- it's just always this weird stuff.

367
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Take your left shoe off and throw it under their right foot, and then--

368
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 this is the perfect example of that.

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 To take out one of these creatures, like to stick it through the heart,

370
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 or to decapitate it, which is another way to kill it,

371
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 you can't do it in combat. You have to freeze it in place.

372
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And once these guys are frozen, if you can freeze them, anything can kill them, technically.

373
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Like if they're frozen, you could shoot them with a shotgun.

374
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 But if they're not frozen, they're coming at you, it's a weird catch.

375
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 You have to decapitate them or stick them with a wooden stake.

376
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 If they're frozen, you can still use those things. They don't become immune to that.

377
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 They're like, "Ah, wood is now my strength."

378
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But once they're frozen, they're actually completely vulnerable.

379
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You can chop them up with a chainsaw if you can get close enough.

380
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Which you could, 'cause they're frozen, but I mean,

381
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 it doesn't still mean you should walk around with chainsaws.

382
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You have to freeze it in place. Here's a couple different ways to do that.

383
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Take a white handkerchief, put a rock in it, tie it, and then throw it at her.

384
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 A hitster shall freeze in place, and then you take your time chopping its head off.

385
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Take your hat off. Woo-woo-woo.

386
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Put it on the ground with the top of the hat touching the ground.

387
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 You take a knife out, you stab the hat.

388
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Freezes are in place. That's just weird.

389
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Those are both weird things that that can...

390
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Whatever part of the legend, like, if you made that up,

391
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 someone would be like, "So, Papa, how do we stop these things?"

392
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And he's like, "Well, little one, you, uh..."

393
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He's looking around the room. He sees a hat. He's like, "You take a hat, and, uh..."

394
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He looks over, sees a knife, and then you take a knife, and then he looks down to the ground,

395
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 and he's like, "Uh..."

396
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So I mean, like, did you just make it up? Or if these things are real,

397
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 how did they figure it out? How many times were they like,

398
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 "Oh, no, she's coming," and they threw their hat on the ground and get murdered.

399
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 The next guy was like, "Oh, no, no, she's coming."

400
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 He takes his hat off the ground and then throws a knife at the hat and gets murdered.

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And then, eventually, over the course of 10,000 years, through human evolution,

402
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 the person evolves to the point where they know, "Oh, if I take my hat off and put a knife through it,"

403
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 then she freezes in place.

404
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Just like vultures learning how to drop turtles.

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Then, this is my favorite one. This is my favorite one to stop this one,

406
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 because it's honestly the most troublesome one.

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 However, if you don't have a handkerchief, you don't have a hat,

408
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 and you're trying to stop one of these things from killing you,

409
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 because they do kill humans as well.

410
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 They just need to kill a baby a month.

411
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They can kill as many people as they want.

412
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 They just have to kill at least one baby a month to survive.

413
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 You may not have a handkerchief. You may not have a hat,

414
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 but you know what I can almost guarantee you having is a pair of pants.

415
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So if you ever see one of these things coming at you,

416
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 what you do is you take your pants off,

417
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 which is not a good defense strategy, right?

418
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You take your pants off.

419
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 You then have to pull while this creature is coming at you, right?

420
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 You take your pants off, which already takes a while.

421
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Take your pants off. You pull one leg through.

422
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So now one leg is inside out.

423
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So now you basically have the two legs going long ways.

424
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And then you throw a matter.

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Throw your jeans at her.

426
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 One leg's normal. The other leg's inside out and it hits her.

427
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 She freezes in place.

428
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 It would honestly be quicker to just go to a hat store

429
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and buy a hat, right?

430
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Because there's no scenario where you're being chased

431
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 by a creature that serves the Dark Lord

432
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 and you're going to have time to take your pants off.

433
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Just taking your pants off alone takes a while.

434
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I think it at least takes me like 30 seconds to take my pants off.

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And that's standing still.

436
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 If I'm being chased, it's going to take more.

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And then usually 30 seconds with my shoes already off,

438
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 if I got to take my shoes off too,

439
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 I'm looking at like a minute and a half.

440
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 You know how fast turkeys fly, dude?

441
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 They don't.

442
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 But I mean, you know how fast vampire witch turkeys fly?

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Faster than a minute and a half.

444
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But here's the thing. You go,

445
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 "Okay, you talking about defense mechanisms.

446
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Take your pants off. Throw it at her.

447
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Throw in handkerchiefs full of rocks and stuff like that.

448
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 That's not a big deal. Here's the problem.

449
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 You throw it at her. You throw the jeans at her.

450
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 You chop her head off. You save your baby.

451
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 You save the people in your house.

452
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Now you become one.

453
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 That's the second way this can happen.

454
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 You can be born one,

455
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and if you kill one,

456
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 you have to eat a baby a month

457
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 until you either can't live with yourself anymore.

458
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Somebody else kills you.

459
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That is a defense mechanism.

460
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I don't think I've ever come across a cryptid.

461
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I don't think I've ever come across that

462
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 outside of fiction, where if you kill the creature,

463
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 you become the creature.

464
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 There actually is a really good movie called Don't Kill It,

465
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 starring Dolph Lundgren. It was dope.

466
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 It felt like it should have been the pilot for a television series.

467
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 You should check it out.

468
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Dead Rabbit recommends Don't Kill It.

469
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But yeah, it was the same thing.

470
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 In that one, if you kill the demon, you get possessed by the demon.

471
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And it was an interesting movie. I liked it.

472
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I watched it when I was trapped in the airport

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 when that massive snowstorm hit.

474
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 But this is...

475
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 I don't want to say this is real life,

476
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 because this is a possibly fictional creature,

477
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 but in the legend, this is real life.

478
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 So if it's sneaking into your house,

479
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 you have to make a judgment call.

480
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 You can try to keep it out of your house.

481
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You can possibly kill your kid.

482
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 But if you kill it, then you simply become one of them yourselves.

483
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Now you are hungering for the blood of the innocent.

484
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And it's like an addiction.

485
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 You can say, "Well, I just won't do it.

486
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I'll just die after that first month,

487
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 but the hunger becomes so intense."

488
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 You'll find yourself setting a little fire in your kitchen

489
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 while the family is asleep.

490
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Taking your legs off.

491
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Transforming into a glowing turkey to find your own feast.

492
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Interesting crypt it all around,

493
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 but it becomes an even more bizarre story

494
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 in the 1950s.

495
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 That locks call estate in central Mexico.

496
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 You had a state official just checking paperwork,

497
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 stamp and stuff, stamp, put it away.

498
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Stamp, put it away.

499
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 This state worker is going through death certificates,

500
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 birth certificates, things like that,

501
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 from villages in his state.

502
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And he starts to notice something on birth certificates.

503
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Now it was on all sorts of birth certificates.

504
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 The older people had this, but it was mostly babies

505
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 were having their cause of death on their birth certificate.

506
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Chupadou pour la bruja.

507
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 What? This must be a typo and he looks at another birth certificate.

508
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Chupadou pour la bruja.

509
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 In English that means sucked by the witch.

510
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 He goes and reports it to his superiors.

511
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 He's like, "Hey, we're getting some weird death certificates

512
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 from a couple villages."

513
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And shows him to them, "What? Sucked by a witch? What's going on?"

514
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 They looked through them and it was mostly babies,

515
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 but there were some adults, some teenagers.

516
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 So they sent state officials out there.

517
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 They sent them out to the villages.

518
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 "Hey, what's going on? We see that you're writing down

519
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 these people are being killed by witches."

520
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Because again, this is a super obscure legend.

521
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Up here, if there's a death certificate that said,

522
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 "Ripped apart by Sasquatch," the county commissioner

523
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 would be like, "What's a Sasquatch?"

524
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 I mean, he wouldn't believe it.

525
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 He wouldn't be like, "Oh, case done. Put it away."

526
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He wouldn't believe it, but he at least know what it was.

527
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 The state officials, they're like,

528
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 "We don't even know what you're talking about.

529
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 There's a witch sucking people out here?"

530
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 And the villagers would tell them about this glowing turkey

531
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 that was flying around, and they basically

532
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 state officials started an investigation.

533
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 What happened was you were finding these babies and these adults.

534
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 These bodies were being found with severe bruising

535
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 and discoloration of the upper body,

536
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and the time of death was usually at night.

537
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 When someone in a corner was taking a look at these bodies,

538
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 they're like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

539
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

540
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 So they put on there.

541
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

542
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

543
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

544
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

545
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

546
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

547
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

548
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

549
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

550
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

551
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

552
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

553
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

554
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

555
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

556
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

557
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

558
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

559
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

560
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

561
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

562
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

563
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising,

564
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 happens at night, probably got attacked by the witch."

565
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

566
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

567
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

568
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

569
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

570
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

571
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

572
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And they were like, "Heavy bruising, happens at night,

574
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 probably got attacked by the witch."

575
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 The police aren't going out there to investigate these deaths,

576
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 but it doesn't mean that the deaths stopped.

577
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 It just means they stopped being reported

578
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 in the way that they were being reported.

579
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It's possible that they just didn't want to have the investigators come out,

580
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 because the townspeople knew how things would play out.

581
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 They keep putting "sucked by a witch."

582
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 They know that the witch is killing them,

583
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 and they keep putting that down.

584
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And some police investigators come out to get the whole story.

585
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 They begin interviewing families.

586
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 They begin pestering witnesses trying to get to the truth.

587
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 The townspeople already know the truth.

588
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 They don't need a police investigation.

589
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 There's a vampire witch there.

590
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 She's been there for a long time.

591
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 The police would eventually find her,

592
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 try to kill her.

593
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 She'd get away.

594
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Maybe she murders them and back up arrives.

595
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Maybe they continue to pursue her until finally they kill her.

596
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And justice is served.

597
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 The townspeople would know what was going to happen next.

598
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And even though their town would be safe,

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 that young police officer who did manage to take this witch down,

600
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 goes back to his hometown, goes back to his old life.

601
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And then a month later, late at night,

602
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 in his house back in the big city,

603
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 he begins to develop a taste for the blood of a child.

604
