1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Did a black car stalk Eastern Europe?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Looking for the organs of little kids?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to Siberia to meet a soldier who disappeared one night while he should have been at his guard post.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Later when he's questioned by the KGB, he tells a bizarre story today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm a walk big gal

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Let's go ahead and hop into Jason Jalopy for our first story. Now our first story is actually a recommendation.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 This recommendation came about a year and a half ago. Like when this show first started off, I got this recommendation.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I don't even know if they still listen to the show, but Mercia, thank you so much for recommending this story.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 We're gonna hop into Jason Jalopy. We're driving out to the Eastern Bloc.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 You know those Warsaw Pact nations? Long ago you had the Eastern European stuff.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 You had Russia took over all that stuff. And then you had the West, which was NATO.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It was really kind of like living in a GI Joe cartoon because he had NATO, which was like the cool good guys.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And then you had the Warsaw Pact hidden behind the Iron Curtain in the Eastern Bloc.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I mean like they really should have made action figures based on that.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Like we would have had much cool. To be fair, the bad guys always had the cooler vehicles. So the Soviets would have had like the Hive Spinner.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And it's like Khrushchev jumping around in like a giant bumblebee that shoots out more bumblebees.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And Americans would just have like tanks. And the GI Joe always had the realistic weapons.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Cobra always had like the crazy things. So you'd have Gorbachev and like a spinning blade that's gonna dig under capitalism.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And then pop up in a bank and unleash all of these red soldiers.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now I'm thinking I should probably actually try inventing that toy line.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But we're not gonna invent a toy line right now. I might after this podcast is over.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We're going to the Eastern Bloc. We're gonna dig underneath the Iron Curtain ourselves.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So get out your official dead rabbit shovels. We're gonna dig under the Iron Curtain.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We're gonna pop up. We're gonna be wearing like big fur hats and big fur coats and stuff like that.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 We're now walking around the night. We'll be in the night.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Because this story went from the 60s to about the 80s. So let's put us around the 1980s.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 We're gonna hop up. We're walking around 1980s. Check out Slovakia.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And we see a black car driving down the street.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Not a big deal. There's lots of cars driving around. Some of them are black. We're not really thinking anything of it.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And another black car drives by. And you're like Jason, are you just gonna keep making car noises?

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Until the right, whatever the right car you're gonna talk about goes by. No, no, no, maybe.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 But no, no, no. Now that you call me out on it, I won't do that.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 We're gonna walk through and we see a bunch of kids playing on the street corner.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And then there's this old grandpa type, like smoking a pipe.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And then there's like an old lady like beating rugs and stuff like a very stereotypical country people.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Like rural people, right? And we're just standing there in our, it's July by the way.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So we take off our fur coats and everything. So we're not totally inconspicuous.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Oh wait, do you want to be? Can you be conspicuous? Because inconspicuous means nobody sees you, right?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But conspicuous, so if you were conspicuous, actually, think about it.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 If you're inconspicuous, that means nobody sees you.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 But if you're conspicuous, does that mean you draw attention? What's in the middle?

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Is there just spicuous? Let's just be spicuous right now. We're not conspicuous, so we don't draw attention,

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 but we're not inconspicuous where we're invisible. We're spicuous right now. We're just normal.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And we see a black Volga, an old-timey Volga car.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The Volga's a car manufacturer style of car that was around back then,

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 but this one looks like it's from the 40s and it's just driving down the road.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And it slows down when it sees the kids. Now we are going to go, that's gross,

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 like there's some big old weirdo in there, right? It's okay to slow down for kids if they're playing in the street.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 You don't want to hit them. If you see a bunch of kids in the street, you're like, "Uh-oh, I don't want to be considered a pervert."

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 You just drive right through them. No, don't do that. You're allowed to slow down for kids if you're going to run over them otherwise.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But if there's some kids playing on the side of the road and you start to slow down, you're probably a pervert, right?

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Now we see this car start to slow down and it stops.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And we see the kids kind of stop, jump open or play in jacks or whatever they did over there.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And something draws their attention to the black Volga.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 They kind of look at each other and then they walk as a group over to the car and we're like, "Uh, this is going to be bad."

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And I go, "It will be, but we can't do anything."

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 They're like, "What?" The back seat of the car door opens up and then the kids get sucked into the car like a vortex.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 "Wooah!"

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Now we can actually look into the back seat. There's nobody there.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 There's nobody there. It's not like the kids got sucked in and now they're sitting in their seatbelts. They're gone.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 We just see the normal back seats of an old school Volga.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "You want to do something?" I put my hand on you. I go, "No, bro. You got to let the events play out."

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 The old man throws down his pipe and begins running over to the Volga.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 No one is going to mess with his neighborhood.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 He walks over to the Volga. He looks into the driver's side window and falls dead in front of us.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Volga drives off. And I turn to you and I go, "Aren't you glad that I didn't let you go over there and assault that driver?"

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And you go, "Jason, I'm mortifying that you brought me to a place where you knew not only children were going to be kidnapped, but an old man would die."

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And I go, "Fair enough, but this myth, this urban legend lasted for 30 years behind the Iron Curtain."

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Czechoslovakia had a very specific variant of it. They had the Black Volga. The Black Volga you'd see in Mongolia,

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 which would be a kind of a dead giveaway because they're like riding horses over there. They got like the steps.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 They're like a bunch of nomads and then there's a black car driving through and they're like, "What?" Throwing spears at it.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But in all these Eastern Black nations, they were seeing this black Volga.

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Now, Volgas were a known car model. People had Volgas. People drove them around. This one was distinctively an older Volga.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 People said, "You saw it and it felt like it was out of place."

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Even if you weren't a knowledgeable person about cars, I know nothing about cars, you would look at it and go,

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 "Something about it would tell you that doesn't belong here."

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Now, the Czechoslovakian variant of it was that it was a black ambulance.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 That it looked like it. And that's pretty ominous because of ambulances, I think, for the most part, unless they're fire rescue ambulances are white.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I know fire rescue ambulances can be red, but a black ambulance makes it a sinister undertone.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 What's interesting is that you have the supernatural side of this myth, where you have the car will drive up,

82
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 the door will open up, the kids get sucked in like it's a portal. Really anybody, but generally the myth or the story was that it was taking the organs.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Which is weird. If you have a vehicle that can distort time and space and teleport matter, I don't think you're like,

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 "Oh yeah, I get $1,000 for this kidney."

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 There's a lot of other stuff you can do with a vehicle that makes people drop dead when they get near it and can consume matter.

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I think you can do more than sell someone's eyeballs on eBay.

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But that was the main thing, was that the kids would get sucked into the back, their organs would be sold.

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Specifically, their blood would be sold to rich Westerners and Arabs.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 The decadent foreigners, to them, were the Arabs and the rich Westerners.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So, and that that, it's funny because of that storyline, it still continues today with stuff like Pizza Gate or Frazzled Rip.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Frazzled Rip, Frazzled Rip, whatever you want to call it.

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 The idea that the elites are eating the blood, the adrenal chrome of kids, that's a whole other thing,

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 but there's this theory that you can torture someone and make them freak out and their blood fills up with adrenal chrome.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 The whole thing, there's a couple of different variations of it, this is one I heard.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You torture someone and they get so afraid their blood gets pumped full of adrenaline,

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 it gets released into their system, it becomes adrenal chrome or it's processed as some sort of drug using the blood of people.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And then the elites eat it, they do it and it makes them feel young or become young or something like that.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And you have to get it injected in your eyeball or something like that, so whenever you see a picture of a celebrity with a black eye,

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 it means they just got done doing adrenal chrome, which I would go, why are they getting their photos taken?

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They're like, "Oh yes, the fresh blood, the fresh blood of the damned. Oh wait, I got a photo shoot.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Yeah, I'll walk outside and get a photo with my eyeball all bruised up."

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Anyways, that conspiracy theory still exists.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 There are people who right now are really believing that all the celebrities aren't really,

104
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I got to go on this little bit, this coronavirus thing.

105
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I'll touch on this later because it's so insane and it's developing still, but here's a tidbit.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 There's a large contingent of people in the conspiracy theory community who believe that all the celebrities aren't in quarantine because of coronavirus.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 They're basically either under arrest because Donald Trump is drained in the swamp.

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Like Tom Hanks is actually in a prison because then there's one photo, you can see a door tag, like you can see a barcode on a door,

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 which people go, that's a door from jail.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Even though it's a normal door with like a normal handle, they think that that handle like leads them into Rikers or something like that.

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And like Madonna is running out of adrenal chrome, that's why she's freaking out.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And in some photos of Ellen's live stream, she doesn't have, she has an ankle bracelet on underneath her sweats, so she's in her house arrest,

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 which why would they be placing these people under house arrest and letting them live stream if they've been devouring the blood of children?

114
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 The whole thing doesn't make sense. The whole thing makes absolutely no sense at all.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But it's funny because this myth from the 1960s is still being believed today that the other consumes our blood.

116
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You can even go as far back as like the blood libel where like the Jews were killing Christians and turning their blood into matzah bread and eating that.

117
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 There's always this idea that the other is consuming our blood, whoever the R is.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And it doesn't matter what time it is, it doesn't matter what era, it's a really weird thing that people believe in all the time.

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Which is fascinating about conspiracy theories because that's the thing, I love conspiracy theories, even though I don't believe in most of them,

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 because you can see these threads fly through it. Why was it that a small village in the Ural Mountains were afraid of the same thing that a YouTuber is afraid of today?

121
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 They may argue because it's true, because the Black Volga was true, that it was devouring the blood and all this stuff,

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and all these Westerners and Arab sheiks were walking around with bruised eyes all the time back then.

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And that's the thing too, when it was the Arabs, it wasn't just like the dude at the falafel stand, it was like rich sheiks, the elite.

124
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So anyway, it's just fascinating to me how this stuff, I think it carries over because it's true, I think it carries over because people are absolutely...

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I actually don't know why, because I'm not super afraid of my blood being drained, but actually that's fascinating because that even goes back to the tales of vampires.

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Like, is it normal for people to have a fear of their blood being drained from their butt?

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 When I say I'm not afraid of it, I don't want it to happen, I'm not lobbying for it, but that's not an innate fear of mine.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But if you go all the way to the old vampire stories, to the Adrenal Chrome stories of today, it's that your blood is being drained by the other.

129
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But see, back then they didn't have stuff like Ellen on YouTube and they couldn't decipher what shirt she was wearing that day.

130
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Means that Joe... No, I'm not making this up. She was wearing a Joe Jonas shirt and she was talking to someone while she was arranging glasses.

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And the shirt had some symbol on it that matched a painting and someone else's back. It's so bizarre, but if you didn't know, breaking news by the way, Ellen's in prison.

132
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And so's Tom Hanks, apparently. This is a massive conspiracy theory that's going on right now.

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And I'll cover it when it's all done. There's a little bit of your preview for that.

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So these conspiracy theories still exist. I feel like I'm a conspiracy theorist folklorist. I like to see how this stuff evolves.

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Back then it was a supernatural car sucking people into it. If you told people, you know Ellen's driving a car while we're all in our houses,

136
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Ellen and Tom Hanks is driving a car around town and anyone who's breaking quarantine gets sucked into the car. You would laugh.

137
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 You would say that's the stupidest thing you've ever heard. But if someone goes, here's some screenshots of this live stream from Ellen and she has a shirt on.

138
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It's always about her shirts. It's always about her shirts. She has a shirt on with a drawing of like a guy with red stuff on his face.

139
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 That's a symbol that she eats people's faces. I guess this has become an Ellen episode now. Why would you wear a shirt of the crime you're in prison for?

140
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Right? Because the conceit is that she's not under house quarantine, that she's currently in house arrest.

141
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Again, you wouldn't put her under house arrest. If someone's eating people's faces, you don't let them be in their mansion.

142
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 But the idea is that she's under house arrest, that President is using this whole thing. This is all fake. This is the conspiracy theory. This is all fake.

143
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 It's to distract us, us homo sapiens. It's to distract us normals from the fact that Donald Trump is cleaning up. He's finally draining the swamp.

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And so Tom Hanks is in prison for eating kids. Ellen DeGeneres is under house arrest for eating kids.

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But she's wearing a shirt that shows her eating a kid and she's just under house arrest for that because you know that's what happens.

146
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And then all these other celebrities are like sending out coded messages and stuff like that. It's just absolutely bizarre.

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But there are a lot of people who believe it. And it's growing every day because I think conspiracy theories grow in the absence of evidence.

148
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And because most of us are confined to our houses and we don't have any proof. I said like in episode 8 or 9 that the key to a perfect conspiracy theory is time,

149
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 plus distance, plus a group we don't trust. If someone starts a conspiracy theory about what's happening in your house right now, you're like,

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 "No, the refrigerator is not talking to me. That's completely ridiculous."

151
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 If you change it to a refrigerator a thousand miles away, 50 years ago, and the U.S. military inventive refrigerator that they could communicate with,

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 some people will believe that because they don't trust the military and they can't prove it. Other people go, "No, that's still pretty stupid."

153
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You can work the conspiracy theory. You can create the conspiracy theory to get into a certain mindset, but time plus distance plus a group you don't already trust,

154
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 that creates the perfect conspiracy theory. People don't, in general, don't trust celebrities. They really don't. People don't trust celebrities.

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They don't trust the elites, which is what celebrities would be. We have a group of people that we can't check in on right now,

156
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 even though they're live streaming, even though you have more access to them now than you have had at any point in the past,

157
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 because literally you're watching them now. With Twitter, with Facebook, with all these things, you can find these celebrities.

158
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You can talk to them. You can interact with them more than you ever could, but they're still considered this other thing.

159
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And then the distance, definitely now that we're all socially isolated, we can't really go anywhere.

160
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So that's this conspiracy theory. I think this is what we're talking about now for the rest of this episode.

161
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So, yeah, it's just a bizarre conspiracy theory that is really taking off.

162
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And people are taking screenshots. There's a picture in some dude's house, some other actor's house, that has a face that has red on it,

163
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 and they go, "Look at this! It's just like Ellen's sweater, dude!" They're communicating with each other.

164
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I mean, I guess maybe. It just seems like a really bad way to communicate.

165
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Why would-- Okay, if I wanted to communicate-- Okay, let's say I have a kid that I need to deliver to Tom Hanks,

166
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 because Tom Hanks is hungry, and Tom Hanks gets arrested, right?

167
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 First off, I'm not then going to post my own YouTube video with weird symbols in the background to just make Tom Hanks more hungry,

168
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 because then that's not helping anyone. What my main thing would be to do is to first get rid of the kid before law enforcement gets me, too.

169
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Let him go. There you go, bye. He's running his street. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm free!"

170
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Black Volga pulls up and I'm like, "Uh-oh. I should get some finishing that story as well, but I can't get sucked in."

171
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Why would you be sending messages back to each other? Why would you be letting everyone else--

172
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Because here's the thing, if a guy on God-like Productions or 4chan or whatever can decipher your symbols, they're not good symbols.

173
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That's a horrible code if anyone can decipher it.

174
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 But, Jason, you have to reveal the code as part of the Illuminati. They got to reveal the code before they do the horrible things because of logic,

175
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 because of the rules we've made up as conspiracy theorists.

176
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It doesn't make sense. I did a whole episode about that, predictive programming.

177
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 You can't-- That's a nonsense thing that's never been proven in anything.

178
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 There's never been a time-- You can't go back to the 1890s and see Hitler references.

179
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You don't see references to Hitler or the Third Riker, any of that stuff, in War of the Worlds.

180
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 In any of the mass media and any of the penny-dreadful novels, you did not see predictive programming telling you what was going to happen about World War II,

181
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 or Korea, or Vietnam. You didn't see it.

182
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The predictive programming theory didn't really even start until 9/11.

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 So this is the rule, and the Illuminati ruled the world since the American Revolution.

184
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Why weren't we seeing these things right after the American Revolution?

185
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Why didn't Tom Sawyer go to a pyramid with an all-CNI in it?

186
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Because it doesn't exist. It's totally made up.

187
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But you have a group of people, again, who are looking at every frame of an Ellen,

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and I don't mean to keep backing on Ellen, but that's the one that's come out the most,

189
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 and I think it's because she's live-streaming. She's putting out so much content.

190
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 People are really-- And why Ellen?

191
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I mean, out of all the people who I would consider the most successful people in the world,

192
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 she's not even in the top thousand.

193
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Why would you-- Her?

194
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Like, seriously, if I was going to put a linchpin on the all-seeing darkness,

195
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 the malevolent power of the Illuminati-- Ellen DeGeneres, really.

196
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Stand-up comedian/failed sitcom star.

197
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Now she has a talk show, which is-- Anyways.

198
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 But see, to a lot of people, though, she's just the elite.

199
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 She's wealthy, and she's connected. That puts her in that bad category.

200
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So the chances of me-- Actually, this is a good point.

201
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The chances of a normal person walking down the street drinking Adrenochrome is almost zero.

202
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 But to Ellen, she's the elite to all of us.

203
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 But then again, I mean, who's Ellen DeGeneres?

204
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Seriously? Ellen De-- Beyonce, maybe?

205
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I'm not saying she does, but if they're pinning it on,

206
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I'm like, "Oh, Beyonce, definitely drinks blood."

207
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 What I'm saying is that the conspiracy theory, if they put it on a bigger celebrity--

208
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I'm not saying I would believe it, but it would be more believable

209
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 than Ellen DeGeneres is drinking human blood.

210
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I mean, if the whole thing's ridiculous.

211
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And not only is she drinking human blood,

212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 she's putting images that prove to us that she's drinking human blood in her livestream.

213
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But she's not telling us that she's drinking human blood.

214
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And the reason why she's in her house isn't because of coronavirus,

215
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 because she's actually arrested a waiting trial in her house for drinking human blood,

216
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 and yet she wears a sweater with a bloody face on it.

217
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Now I'm gonna have to go find a bunch of show notes on this.

218
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Thanks a lot, rant.

219
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But there is a good group of people who-- I wouldn't say good.

220
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 There is a group of people who believe that that's what this is all about.

221
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 The coronavirus is actually a big scam.

222
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And I don't believe that. Staying in your home, social distancing,

223
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 but the coronavirus is a big scam.

224
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So Donald Trump can actually round up all the celebrities without everyone jumping in the way

225
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 and being like, "I'm Ellen DeGeneres." No!

226
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I'm Ellen DeGeneres. No! We're all Ellen De--

227
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 What would we do if the feds arrested Ellen DeGeneres for eating people's faces?

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You'd go, "Oh, that's gross. I hope she's innocent."

229
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And you would wait for trial.

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 No one jumped in front of Harvey Weinstein and goes, "I'm Harvey Weinstein."

231
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 No, I'm-- people are just like, "Okay, yeah, go to jail and get-- have a trial.

232
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That's what we do in this country."

233
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So, but anyways, the coronavirus-- you heard it-- you heard it here first.

234
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 If you're not a total lunatic and haven't spent all your time on the web lately,

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 coronavirus apparently is 100% fake.

236
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 It's just to keep us inside while they are-- this whole global shutdown.

237
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's because they want to arrest Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Hanks, Madonna.

238
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 She's also one of these people. I think Miley Cyrus is one of these-- which I know, that's not true.

239
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And we have all these other, like, world leaders apparently.

240
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So, like, Merkel and stuff like that. I don't know.

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So, this whole thing, the economy taking a big hit, all because they really needed to stop that newest shipment.

242
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 A fresh human blood being shipped across the border and they stopped it.

243
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And then they go, "Okay, step two, shut down the global economy and then we'll eventually arrest Ellen during a live stream."

244
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 It's absolutely bizarre.

245
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 But let's finish up this black vulgar story here real quick.

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 A lot of people believe-- and this kind of goes into this thing as well.

247
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Some people believe that the car was driven by the men in black. It had some UFO connections.

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Some people believe that the car was not driven by anyone.

249
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 They would either see a mist in the car or nothing at all. You just drive down the street.

250
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Some people believe the car was driven by Satan himself.

251
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 By Satan himself.

252
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And I'll bet you anything, if you really looked into it, you would see an evolution.

253
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I bet you that the story of the black vulgar, when it first started off, was inspired by the KGB.

254
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 They drove black vulgas. Not an old-timey one, but black vulgas in general.

255
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Driving down the street, picking up dissidents and people never being a scene again.

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And I bet you if you followed that story from the 1960s, when you would have areas that weren't--

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 they were normal areas. Everything was going fine and you had the KGB start to tighten their grip.

258
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Coming in these areas, taking out people who were speaking up too much. Disappearing.

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And then the myth became more supernatural.

260
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 To the point where first off, the people weren't being dragged into cars.

261
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 They were being sucked into cars. And then the car has no driver.

262
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Like the car is haunted. And then eventually the car is driven by Satan himself.

263
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 He actually is like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum, I have a lot of stuff to do in hell, man. I'm super busy."

264
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 But you know, at the same time, I like to get out. I like to get some of the outdoors.

265
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So he gets in his vulgar and he drives around and he sucks people into it.

266
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Like, he's the king of hell. He's the main adversary to the Almighty God.

267
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I think he has more important things to do than to drive around a single car abducting people.

268
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Like, there's like an upcoming war of good versus evil and he's supposed to lose.

269
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And he knows he's supposed to lose. And yet he's still working really, really hard to get everything done.

270
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But nah, he's gonna take a couple days off for 30 years and drive around abducting children.

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I think it's most likely the myth came from KGB actually taking people.

272
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Now, of course, there are, sickos out there, there is an organ market out there.

273
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 People do get kidnapped for their organs, but it's actually a lot less than people think.

274
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 A lot of times more people sell their organs than they actually get kidnapped for their organs, but it does happen.

275
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I know that there was a thing about ISIS was selling the organs of the people.

276
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And China's gotten in trouble or gotten accused, I don't think they've ever gotten in trouble.

277
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 China's gotten accused of organs as well, prisoners and things like that.

278
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So you do have stuff like that, but it would seem fairly inefficient to drive around a super-natural car.

279
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And what would you do with the organs of kids? Well, I get it, because you know, they're so tiny, you can't really use them much.

280
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I think that really goes into the whole like kids and the blood, because even I think that was the old story with the Jews,

281
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 it was the Christian babies, the Christian kids. This episode was kind of really grim.

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 But throughout time, and even the vampires go back to that, it was always the virgins, it was innocent.

283
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 It's innocent blood. So what we see going forward from the vampire mythos all the way to nowadays.

284
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And again, somebody could say the reason why we have that thread go through history is because it's true, Jason,

285
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 because vampires, that was the elite back then, and then you really had the Jews drinking the blood of the...

286
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I'm waiting to see the emails I get because saying, "Jason, you know that statement.

287
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Everything else you said was hilarious, but that's true. The bloodline."

288
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And then, trust me, I'll get those emails, and then we'll have this path follow through, and then we'll get to...

289
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Here, where we're at now with this Adrena Chrome thing, which as far as I know is...

290
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I know there's like a real company that is trying to take the plasma of...

291
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Young people can donate their plasma, they can inject it in old people,

292
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 and a lot of people who believe in this conspiracy theory go, "Check this link out. Check this link out."

293
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 First off, it's junk science, and I think it's just a way to rip off old people.

294
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 There's no one... And also, let me say this, if this is proof that Adrena Chrome...

295
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Why would there be articles about it in like science wire?

296
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Why would I be able to know about that if this article is part of proving the conspiracy is real?

297
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 One of the people who are getting their daily eyeball injections of Adrena Chrome would be like,

298
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 "Yo, don't write that article. Don't make your company go public.

299
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Just work for it. Why would we know about any of this stuff?"

300
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Anyways, but yeah, so apparently there is a company that takes the plasma out of young people,

301
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and can put it in old people, and they pay the young people, and they really, really highly charge the old people,

302
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 because when you get older, you'll do anything to stay healthy and stay young,

303
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and that, again, is something that has gone throughout history, but that's just because people are afraid of dying.

304
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And I think the more powerful you get, and the older you get, the more likely you'll go to the extremes,

305
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 because you have the ability to do these things.

306
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 A normal guy who's working the potato farm is not like, "Oh, I'm gonna get myself cryogenically frozen.

307
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I'm gonna live forever."

308
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I mean, that might be an interesting thought, but he has more important things to do.

309
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But a guy who's super wealthy, who has the money to actually get himself cryogenically frozen, he'll look into that,

310
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 or getting his brain downloaded into a computer or whatever.

311
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I guess we're gonna wrap this episode up by saying, "I do not believe that Ellen DeGeneres is eating kids,

312
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 and I do believe that the coronavirus is a real thing."

313
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Again, the amount of emails, this is not the episode I expected you to do, but the amount of emails in YouTube comments,

314
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 YouTube comments may be not so much, but I'll probably get a couple.

315
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 They'll be like, "No, no, here, check out this link." And I've checked out the link.

316
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Anyways, the point of the matter is, the coronavirus, I believe, is real.

317
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I think there are some interesting things going on in the background, and I want to explore those after this is all over.

318
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 But overall, the coronavirus is real. You can get it. You can get really sick.

319
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I think the death rate's too high. I think we'll find that it's much, much lower.

320
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 But that doesn't mean it's okay to go out. You can still get sick. I don't want to get too preachy.

321
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And I think that going back to the fun conspiracy stuff, they're going an overdrive.

322
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 We're trying to make sense of the fact that a couple people ate bats 5,000 miles away, and now, like, I can't leave my house.

323
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And I'm concerned about my loved ones, and I'm concerned about myself, but I mean, I'm fine.

324
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And it's hard to wrap our heads around that. It's very much like 9/11.

325
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 You are going about your day, and all of a sudden you have this massive terror attack, and everything kind of changes.

326
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And just like 9/11 spawned a ton of conspiracy theories, this 9/11, the whole 9/11 was an inside job, dude.

327
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Oh, man, that was nothing compared to what's coming out of this. Nothing.

328
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 The conspiracy theories that are going to come out of coronavirus are going to make 9/11 was an inside job look like baby's first conspiracy theory.

329
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And I would say this, 9/11 was an inside job made JFK, that whole conspiracy theory, look quaint.

330
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 That's what this is going to do to 9/11. The stuff--now, obviously Ellen DeGeneres is going to go back on the air, or what if she doesn't, dude?

331
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 What if she just--I retight--we never see him again. What if from now on Tom Hanks is like, "You know, I'm just going to live in Australia, and I'm going to do all my movies via webcam."

332
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It'd be weird. I don't think it's going to happen, but everything will go on, but we're going to see some of the most insane--

333
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 because even back when 9/11 was an inside job, the craziest conspiracy theory back then, there was two of them.

334
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Before 9/11, there was two crazy conspiracy theories. Reptiles are taking over the planet, Project Bluebeam.

335
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Those are the two craziest ones. Bluebeam wasn't very well known, but it was definitely illogical.

336
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And then you have the ongoing conspiracy theory of "into the world."

337
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And depending on what region you're in, what religion you're followed, that will take different paths.

338
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 But we had not many crazy conspiracy theories before 9/11.

339
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I guess the moon landing was fake, but that one's fairly realistic. Flat Earth was very--it was a joke.

340
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Like, the Flat Earth Society had like 200 members in it and stuff like that. It was something that was just kind of a joke.

341
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 People would join it just to get a plaque that they could put on their wall. This is a member of the Flat Earth Society.

342
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You had offshoots like Church of the Subgenius and kind of like weird things. You had doomsday cults, I guess.

343
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But after 9/11, we've seen this massive evolution of conspiracy theories, because first it started off the, you know, planes.

344
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It was an inside job that they knew about it. There's bombs in the buildings, and then it evolved to there's actually space lasers,

345
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 or the Twin Towers never existed in the first place. All sorts of crazy stuff, and that's opened us up to--

346
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 there's no such thing as mountains. There's really the stumps of dead trees. Monkeys don't exist.

347
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 World War II never happened. Nukes don't exist. These are all conspiracy theories we've covered on the show.

348
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And you have a couple hundred to a hundred thousand people believing in these different conspiracy theories.

349
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 All of that changes now. The coronavirus, the conspiracy theories that come out of this are going to make that--

350
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 I don't know what form they're going to take, but I mean, I guess we have a pretty good indicator right now with this adrenochrome thing.

351
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 We're in the middle of it, and the most absurd conspiracy theory possible is already been crafted out of this.

352
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 So where we're going in the next few years, I think we're going to see some very, very interesting conspiracy theories.

353
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 I think this is going to be the third age of crazy conspiracy theories.

354
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 You had them start in the 60s-- the Cold War, you had a bunch of them. Obviously, Kennedy. That was the first age of conspiracy theories.

355
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And then you had the second age, which was 9/11, and now who-- this is going to get bizarre.

356
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 We will save the soldier story for tomorrow, obviously. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address.

357
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You can also hit us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. Twitter is @DeadRabbitRadio.
