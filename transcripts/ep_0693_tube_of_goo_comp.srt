1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 An artist has one shot to make it to the big time.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,280
 And they will meet a young man who encountered a strange entity while he was dreaming.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,360
 And if that wasn't bizarre enough, the entity began to follow him night after night.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,840
 Dream after dream.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:38,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,840
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our newest Patreon supporter,

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,400
 doing all sorts of exercises because that's what his name sounds like.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 It's bulk.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 Squat thrust.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,120
 He's thrust in his way into Dead Rabbit Command.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
 Bulk, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,920
 Just make sure you're spreading the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,600
 Tell your friends, talk about it online.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,320
 That is how you can also help out the show.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,400
 Bulk, squat thrust.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,760
 Go ahead, stop thrusting in our faces.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,400
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're gonna leave behind

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,800
 Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,800
 We are headed out to 8 Mile Detroit.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
 So I've watched 8 Mile.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120
 It should make sense while we're headed here.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,280
 I was watching 8 Mile.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,000
 Remember that movie with Eminem?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
 I watched it last night.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,840
 That movie does not hold up well.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,080
 It really doesn't.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,680
 This is a movie review podcast because that'd be a pretty generic review.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,000
 It doesn't hold up well.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,080
 Eminem himself is cool, but the movie is, it does not age well.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
 It really doesn't.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 It's super chaotic.

33
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,160
 There's real no narrative structure.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,160
 Everything's just kind of given to Eminem.

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,320
 There's a scene where they're about to get evicted from their home until his mom wins

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,000
 bingo and you're like, "Okay, I guess that's the end of that storyline?"

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,640
 Everything just kind of happens to him and everyone tells Eminem, or sorry, B-Rabbit,

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,240
 how good he is the whole time.

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
 He's like, "Nah, I'm not that good.

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
 I'm not..."

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,800
 It was such a bizarre movie.

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,160
 But when you look at Eminem, I really like Eminem.

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,080
 When you look at Eminem, you see he was in that trajectory.

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,880
 Remember he was such a raw talent when he came out.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 He was in your face.

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,200
 He was making a bunch of homophobic slurs, a bunch of stuff against women, specific women,

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 his mother, his girlfriend.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
 It was really raw.

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,760
 And as a rap fan, that was normal.

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,640
 But for the overall population, they're like, "Oh my God, this is super shocking.

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,040
 We can't believe this is going on."

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
 And that's what made him so popular.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
 I think his skill is what kept him popular, but he had to get in people's faces to be

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,680
 noticed in the first place.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,080
 That happens to a lot of artists.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
 So sometimes you can start off really edgy.

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,760
 When you look at early stuff like Stephen King, where they're having child orgies and

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,840
 it, he doesn't do that in his later novels.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
 He doesn't do that when he's super established, when he's cranking out novels.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,880
 In his early work, you're more shocking.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,040
 That's just how artistry works.

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,440
 And then you start to kind of temper your emotions.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,680
 You kind of realize you probably shouldn't go that far in your stories.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,160
 And Eminem is the same way.

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,960
 I think all artists are the same way.

66
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
 Let's take a look.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
 Let's drive past Eight Mile.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
 We're saying goodbye to Cheddar Bob.

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
 One of the worst characters.

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,360
 I swear that if you have not seen, it has five stars on Amazon Prime.

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,240
 If you have not seen Eight Mile lately, rewatch it.

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,120
 It's terrible.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,720
 It's a terrible, terrible movie.

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
 It has some great actors.

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 Anthony Mackie.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,200
 Isn't it Falcon?

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
 Is Papa Doc?

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
 It's crazy.

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,040
 But again, this is not a movie review podcast, but it's so bad.

80
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's embarrassingly bad.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
 But anyways, we're going to keep driving past Eight Mile.

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,560
 This isn't, that's a segway.

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,760
 I was having Bulk's Squat Thrust Drive as a pass there just as a segway.

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,640
 Because we're going to meet another artist.

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,800
 Bulk, keep on driving past Eight Mile.

86
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,680
 We're headed out to New York City.

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 And a guy just like Eminem.

88
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,920
 And again, all artists kind of go through this phase.

89
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,120
 We're going to meet this guy named Tom Otternis.

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,360
 Today, he's one of America's most prolific sculptors.

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,040
 He's taken pieces of, he's taken pieces of matter and removing it until like a little,

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,520
 a little person appears.

93
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,160
 If you didn't know what sculpting was, that's what it is.

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 You're like taking notes.

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,680
 You're like, oh, totally going to pass my art test.

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,200
 Eight Mile equals sucks.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,680
 After remove matter until something appears.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
 He's known for this big art exhibit called Life Underground.

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
 It's in the New York subway system.

100
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,920
 Between 14th Street and 8th Avenue subway stations, there's a hundred little bronze cast

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
 sculptures.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,200
 They're kind of, some of them are kind of hidden.

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
 Some of them are on plain sight.

104
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,680
 There's one apparently of like a little guy climbing a turnstile to kind of like put a

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
 coin in.

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,760
 There's just these little whimsical statues that you see when you're walking through the

107
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 subway.

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 You're getting mugged.

109
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 You're like, oh, look at the whimsy over there.

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
 Beautiful, right?

111
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,960
 And nowadays, he's commanding $500, $750,000 for his art.

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,200
 Very, very Tom Otternis is a high demand sculptor.

113
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,280
 Sometimes he does big public works.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 He'll get contract.

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
 Recently he had a contract with like the city of San Francisco.

116
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,920
 And then people will pay him six figures to come and make personal art for them.

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,760
 Well, let's go back to the year 1978.

118
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,560
 If Tom Otternis is listening to this podcast, he's like, oh no, really?

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
 That's what you're going to talk about in my career?

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,040
 In 1978, Tom Otternis was in his Eminem phase.

121
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,280
 Where he's like, yo, I got one shot.

122
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,600
 I got one shot to do this.

123
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,200
 So I got to get the ball rolling.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,240
 Now he was kind of an established artist at the time, but you're still trying to make

125
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,160
 a name for yourself.

126
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,000
 1978, he became part of this thing called punk art, which sounds dope, right?

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,880
 Which would encapsulate stuff like Stephen King, stuff like Eminem.

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,000
 Breaking the boundaries of what should be.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,240
 I mean, when you think of horror novels before Stephen King, it was stuff like Dracula.

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,600
 And then you have Stephen King really shaking up the game.

131
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,920
 And that's not fair.

132
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,760
 Richard Matheson, there was a lot of horror authors in between there.

133
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
 But you have this punk art movement.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,000
 Tom Otternis in 1978 made a short film called Rats in Chinatown.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,080
 Where he filmed rats crawling all over a Chinese deli.

136
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,280
 Now I know grammatically, it may sound like there was a building that held the Chinese

137
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,120
 deli and the rats were climbing on top of it.

138
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
 Uh-uh-uh.

139
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 Apparently it's inside the Chinese deli.

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
 That would be fine, right?

141
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
 I guess that would still be pretty gross.

142
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
 If you're like, "Hey, let's go into that deli."

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,120
 There's a bunch of rats on the roof and the cook's like, "They're not inside.

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,880
 They're only swarming the building itself."

145
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,440
 But inside, it's totally clean.

146
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,640
 It would still be disgusting, but it's like rats crawling inside a Chinese deli.

147
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,240
 Which actually, now think about it, there was such a thing as a Chinese deli.

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,120
 I thought a deli was where you made sandwiches.

149
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,360
 I guess I'm really like hung up on the words.

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,080
 The fact is there's rats.

151
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,280
 There's rats where you want to eat.

152
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,720
 That's the main point.

153
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
 I'm not the film critic and I'm like, "Hmm, where is this Chinese deli?

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,000
 I want to know if they serve roast beef."

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
 No, the fact is he's trying to eat and there's rats everywhere.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,520
 Tom also used to be an amateur boxer, so he made a short film of a bunch of his fights

157
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
 and he was showing that as an art exhibit.

158
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
 That's not really an art exhibit.

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,960
 That's just sports center, right?

160
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,200
 But he'd have this art exhibit.

161
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 He's like, "Hey, look at me.

162
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
 You think you can take me?"

163
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,440
 He's all beating up the people who are coming in.

164
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
 "Ah, this is the worst art show ever."

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
 They'd be wrong.

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,400
 My made-up art show is not the worst art show ever.

167
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:04,240
 Because Tom Otternis back in 1978 had another short film for an art exhibit that he made.

168
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
 Now remember, he was establishing his name as an artist back then.

169
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,200
 Since then, life underground, this massive artwork project for the city of New York, he's

170
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,360
 gotten six-figure salaries for his art.

171
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
 He's gotten city contracts since 1978.

172
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
 In 1978, Tom came up with an idea for this punk art movement.

173
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,840
 He was going to make a movie.

174
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,200
 I guess he was living in Colorado at the time or visiting Colorado at the time.

175
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
 I couldn't really nail that down.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,280
 But in Colorado, feel free to skip ahead five minutes if you're a sensitive person or someone

177
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,320
 who's very prone to anger.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,640
 In 1978, Tom was in Colorado.

179
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,400
 He went to a dog shelter.

180
00:08:50,400 --> 00:09:01,360
 He adopted a dog, brought it home, leashed it to a fence pole, and then filmed himself

181
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,200
 shooting it until it died.

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,680
 He then took that movie of him killing a dog.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,080
 It's called Shot Dog Film.

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,360
 His art exhibit was showing him shooting a dog that he just adopted from a shelter.

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 Nobody knew what it was.

186
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,520
 People were coming into this art exhibit.

187
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
 They walked into this room.

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,840
 They saw a dog getting shot to death.

189
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,920
 They're like, "Oh, dude, this is horrible."

190
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,040
 As they were leaving, he had a photographer with this big...

191
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,760
 I mean, that's not trolley enough, right?

192
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,480
 That's inhumane.

193
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,320
 As people were leaving the art exhibit, he hired a photographer with a big, giant flash

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,680
 bulb on his camera to take a picture of them.

195
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,600
 The shocked look on their faces after they just saw a dog get killed.

196
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
 Then a bright light in your face.

197
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
 Then that was the art.

198
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
 He was ambushing the audience.

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,480
 He saw this as a revolutionary act.

200
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,880
 He's assaulting the audience.

201
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,080
 People were absolutely shocked by this.

202
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,760
 People were outraged, actually, but because it was this underground art movement, this

203
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,480
 punk art movement, it wasn't this big thing.

204
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,080
 You expected to get a level of punk, but GG Allen wasn't ripping dogs in half, right?

205
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,440
 GG Allen was throwing his poop at people and stuff like that.

206
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,560
 He wasn't hurting animals, so this was too much even for the punk community.

207
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,000
 But you really didn't see much of an outrage in the mainstream until a year or two later

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
 later.

209
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,320
 There was this Manhattan cable TV, I assume it was like access television or something

210
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
 like that.

211
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,680
 Somebody somehow, everyone has denied that they had any part in this, but somebody apparently

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,880
 made a documentary about shot dog film and in the documentary itself shows him shooting

213
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,120
 the dog over and over again.

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
 They keep playing.

215
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,720
 Someone took this footage, someone took this documentary and broadcasted on Manhattan

216
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,160
 cable television.

217
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,860
 That was still before life underground.

218
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,220
 That was still before his career took off.

219
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,200
 People knew that he killed this dog.

220
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,760
 The New York Times was like, "Yeah, people try to make a big deal about the fact that

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 he..."

222
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,000
 I'm paraphrasing obviously, but the New York Times was like, "Yeah, you know, he shot a

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,480
 dog, but let bygones be bygones."

224
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,960
 That was early in his career.

225
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,400
 That was kind of the tactic that the media was taking towards Tom Autorness.

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,800
 So even after shooting this dog on camera, that is when his career blew up.

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,320
 That's when he starts to get these big six-figure contracts.

228
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,280
 More enlightened people, more normal human beings tried extraditing him to Colorado to

229
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,440
 be prosecuted for this crime.

230
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,000
 The problem is, is back then, I'm sure it's over now, but back then, that was a misdemeanor.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
 To shoot a dog is a misdemeanor.

232
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,680
 So they're like, "Can you really extradite someone for a misdemeanor?"

233
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,720
 And he had friends in high places at this point.

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
 He had friends in the art community.

235
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 "Oh, it's just art.

236
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
 Why are you guys so upset?"

237
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,840
 So in 2008, 30 years later, he finally issued an apology.

238
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,000
 In 2011, people were protesting about it.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,640
 He actually got like a two...

240
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,320
 He got this big contract for the city of San Francisco.

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,200
 Now it's more well-known in the art community.

242
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,520
 People were protesting it.

243
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 But even then, the city of San Francisco just...

244
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,960
 He was signed up for two projects.

245
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,640
 They just canceled one of them.

246
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,000
 So people are still embracing Tom Otterness.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
 Fascinating, really.

248
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,480
 And it's gross.

249
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,800
 And if you want any proof of like this weird Luciferian agenda, right, you have to wonder

250
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,280
 about people who support somebody who shot a dog on camera, who know that that happened,

251
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,600
 who shot a dog on camera and continue to give him tons of money for his art.

252
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 You can talk all day long about all this other stuff, about these numerology theories and

253
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
 you found these codes and stuff like that.

254
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,240
 This story, I'm surprised, isn't more well-known.

255
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,720
 Because this, to me, is grosser than anything Marina Abramovich did, where she's writing

256
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,040
 like her spirit cooking handbook.

257
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,240
 Talking about like drinking semen and milk.

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,880
 Like, it's just a weird fetish thing.

259
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 This is...

260
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,760
 And I did a segment on Marina Abramovich.

261
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
 I'll put that in the show notes.

262
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,080
 I thought that was pretty interesting, but she's never done this.

263
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,680
 And she's getting canceled from Microsoft ads.

264
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,840
 You want to talk about weirdo stuff where someone sacrifices a dog in the name of art

265
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
 and ends up becoming famous and wealthy.

266
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,520
 And to this day, even though it's out, people are still running cover for him.

267
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,720
 Take a look at this story.

268
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 Take a look at this story.

269
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,680
 I randomly came across this story.

270
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
 I was looking...

271
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,960
 I go to this website every day.

272
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,040
 It's one of my daily websites called Crazy Facts.

273
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,960
 I've gotten a ton of stuff from there.

274
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,680
 I got a ton of stuff from there.

275
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,520
 And I just hit random fact, random fact over and over and over again.

276
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,960
 It gives me that little dopamine hit when I'm learning something new.

277
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
 And this popped up.

278
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,240
 It was just random that I came across it.

279
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,680
 So, creepy, creepy story, sacrificing animals for success.

280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,800
 Bulk squat thrust.

281
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,480
 Let's leave this grossness behind.

282
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

283
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,360
 We are leaving behind San Francisco.

284
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,040
 We are headed out to a small town in the middle of America.

285
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,000
 [imitates car noises]

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
 I found this story online.

287
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,080
 We don't have a location for it.

288
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,640
 That's why Bulk Squat Thrust is currently trying to find anywhere to land.

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,680
 We're running low on fuel.

290
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
 But I found this story.

291
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,360
 It's written by a user known as Syntax Variant.

292
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,400
 I'm not going to call him by his Tron name.

293
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,440
 The rest of the segment, let's call him Max.

294
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,480
 And if that's his real name, it's just a stab in the dark.

295
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,520
 And the first part of this is a dream.

296
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,160
 And I know, I like the other 7 billion people on this planet hate when people talk about

297
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
 their dreams.

298
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
 I don't know what it is.

299
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,040
 I don't know if there's some sort of psychological thing going on.

300
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,560
 But nobody likes to hear about other people's dreams.

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,080
 But you know what I mean?

302
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,200
 Like when someone says, "Dude, check out this dream I have."

303
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,640
 You're automatically automatically shut off your brain and you hope that they don't notice.

304
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,000
 It's super bizarre, isn't it?

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 We don't like hearing about other people's dreams.

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,640
 And not only that, the most aggravating, I'm surprised it still even exists, the most

307
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,960
 aggravating ending to a movie.

308
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,520
 It was all a dream.

309
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,480
 I wonder if psychologists have ever looked into that.

310
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,600
 I wonder if someone's ever done a study.

311
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
 Why do people hate hearing about other people's dreams?

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
 Because it's not just me.

313
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
 Everyone, everyone hates it.

314
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,480
 So we're starting, as I set that up, let me tell you about this guy's dream.

315
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,720
 It's interesting.

316
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
 And I'm not going to spend too much time in the dream world.

317
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,240
 Especially when Max describes it as a "fleshy and eldricked place."

318
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,920
 And he says, I mean, not that I'm against fleshyness.

319
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,360
 But he starts off this thing.

320
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,560
 He goes, "The dream was a mix between scorn and hermeneus mora's plane."

321
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,080
 I had to look those up.

322
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,840
 I'm not native to the fleshy and eldricked plane.

323
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,560
 Scorn, I had a vague idea of, is a video game that took place in hell.

324
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,400
 Her mayas mora's plane, she's an elder scrolls character.

325
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,880
 Some sort of goblin or dragon or wave or something like that.

326
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,160
 She's a bunch of ones and zeros in the form of a goddess I'm assuming, because she has

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 her own plane.

328
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,440
 He's dreaming he's in a video game-esque world, or like an eldrick place.

329
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,160
 Max is walking through this fleshy place.

330
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,360
 He's like, "Reminds me of Toejaminer all stage two."

331
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,440
 He's walking through this fleshy place and he sees something out of the corner of his

332
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,000
 eye.

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,920
 It was a tube of semi-fluidic goo.

334
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,440
 It was a floating around.

335
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
 It was metallic black.

336
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,000
 I mean this guy credit at least.

337
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,200
 His dream is pretty kickass.

338
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,040
 A metallic black tube of semi-fluidic substance.

339
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,120
 Sometimes it's floating behind him.

340
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,840
 Sometimes it's crawling on the wall.

341
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,800
 We imagine it gets bored of floating.

342
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,000
 No one would ever get bored of floating, but this guy's like, "I'm gonna do the wall thing

343
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 now."

344
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,120
 They're crawling on the fleshy wall.

345
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,840
 Max turns around and this his party tells him, "Yeah, I'm like a super intuitive guy.

346
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,320
 Like I like to ask questions."

347
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,480
 When I'm in a fleshy and eldrick place, I wonder, "Whose flesh is this?

348
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,520
 Is this Pamela Anderson's flesh?"

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,840
 He turns around and because he's so inquisitive, he lets us know how inquisitive he is, he

350
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,000
 turns around and he looks at the tube and he goes, "Why are you following me?"

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,680
 He's not scared of it, right?

352
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,480
 I was wondering why this tube of goo is following him.

353
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
 The goo says it was visiting this place too.

354
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,640
 I didn't read all those brochures.

355
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,800
 Flesh Lovers Journal, he thought it was actually a porn magazine.

356
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,040
 Instead, it was a tourist guide for all these other dimensions.

357
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,720
 The tube of goo goes, "I'm new around here too."

358
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,360
 And actually, I'm surprised you're not afraid of me.

359
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,760
 Normally, when you humans see a tube of goo, you either run away from us or try to eat

360
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 us.

361
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,200
 That's when Max is like, "No, you don't get it.

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,920
 I'm not like the mother of humans.

363
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,720
 I actually am super curious.

364
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,760
 I love to learn new information."

365
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,280
 The tube of goo goes, "Well, I'm new here and you're new here.

366
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
 It's kind of interesting.

367
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,520
 Maybe we should hang out for a bit."

368
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,600
 He said that the tube of goo sounded like a woman in her 30s.

369
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 Super specific.

370
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,480
 I don't think I could tell the difference between a woman talking on the phone who's

371
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,560
 27 and I'm like, "Hmm, this woman has to be at least 38, 39."

372
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
 But this guy can do it.

373
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
 This guy has a good ear.

374
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 And so they're talking.

375
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,480
 "Come to this realm often?"

376
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,440
 And Max goes, "Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about the realm you're from?"

377
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,840
 And the tube of goo says, "It would be much easier."

378
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,080
 Apparently, it turns into the leprechaun when you ask it a question.

379
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,000
 It would be much easier if I showed you where I was from.

380
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,440
 How would you like to come to my realm?"

381
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
 And Max goes, "Well, nothing seems to be going on here.

382
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 It's just endless, endless walls of flesh.

383
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 So yeah, I'm sure your place is an upgrade."

384
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,000
 So then the tube of goo teleports him.

385
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Don't worry.

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Don't worry.

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
 I know your eyes are glazed over.

388
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,080
 Your eyes are glazed over with black goo.

389
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,720
 You're like, "Stop telling the story.

390
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
 It's possessingly..."

391
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 The dream ends soon.

392
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,240
 Does that not do a whole segment on this dude's dream?

393
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,840
 So hold on.

394
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 Have faith in me.

395
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,960
 If you've listened to the show this long, you should have faith in me.

396
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:11,560
 The tube of goo teleports him to a world that Max can only describe as abstract.

397
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,560
 It's just like, I don't know, melting people and clocks falling off of branches and gravity

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
 is upside down.

399
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,640
 It just doesn't make sense.

400
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
 But there's also a castle.

401
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,880
 There's all this stuff out of all this abstract stuff.

402
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,080
 There's like a fairy tale castle sitting there and the tube of goo goes, "That's where I

403
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
 live, dude."

404
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,880
 And so they're like swirling around and he's leading Max through this adventure.

405
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,680
 I imagine like the landscape of Sharkboy and Lava Girl.

406
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,320
 The tube goes, "Listen, tell you what.

407
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,520
 I've shown you my place."

408
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,720
 How would you like to know even more about everything?

409
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,000
 And Max is like, "Why wouldn't you want to know?

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
 He's a curious cat, right?

411
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
 He wants to know everything."

412
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,760
 And the tube of goo goes, "Let me come inside you."

413
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,280
 The tube of goo did not actually say that.

414
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,400
 That should be a warning sign if a tube of goo ever says that to you.

415
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,840
 A tube of goo says, "Let me come inside of you."

416
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,160
 And I will show you everything.

417
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
 I'll give you all these knowledge.

418
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
 I'll give you these special abilities.

419
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,000
 If you ever wanted to climb along a wall, that's me.

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I do that.

421
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,880
 But I'm going to have to merge with you.

422
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,920
 And Max says, "Sure."

423
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,560
 And at that point, the tube of goo goes inside of his body and then he begins to notice that

424
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,040
 the tube of goo is accessing his memories from the waking world.

425
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,680
 Like he can feel this thing actually absorbing real world information outside of the dream.

426
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
 And he starts to wake up.

427
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,560
 Like his body is almost going into this motion where it's trying to get him out of this unconscious

428
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,360
 mess that he's gotten himself into.

429
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,240
 And here's the tube of goo say, "I need to merge with your subconscious.

430
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,240
 I need to find it.

431
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
 I need to find it quickly because if I merge with it, I'll stay alive."

432
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 And Max wakes up.

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,120
 And he's totally well rested.

434
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,480
 He's like, "Oh, another calm dream for me.

435
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,000
 Max, the biggest weirdo in the world."

436
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
 That dream doesn't even face him.

437
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,280
 He's like, "That's not even the crazy stream.

438
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,200
 What happens is this tube of goo goes in him.

439
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 So the dream's over."

440
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
 He goes about his day.

441
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,320
 Everything's fine.

442
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,040
 And then he does what all humans do.

443
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,320
 He goes back to sleep and has another dream, wakes up, goes back to sleep, wakes up.

444
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,000
 You know the process of human biology.

445
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
 But he starts to notice a pattern.

446
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 He'll be having a dream, a totally unrelated dream, not involving fleshy, long hallways.

447
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 He's just sitting at school.

448
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,080
 He's sitting at flesh high, his school that he's going to.

449
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,720
 And he'd be sitting at school and he'd see the tube of goo out of the corner of his eye.

450
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,360
 He's like trying to cheat off it.

451
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,560
 He's trying to cheat off it.

452
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
 The tube of goo is just wearing its underwear.

453
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,600
 It's like, "Oh, I'm so embarrassed."

454
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
 Then he wakes up.

455
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 It's like, "What?

456
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 That was weird."

457
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
 He goes about his life.

458
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
 He has another dream.

459
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,600
 He's walking through a meadow, flying a kite.

460
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,440
 He looks out of the corner of his eye.

461
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
 There's tube of goo.

462
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,800
 The tube of goo just sitting in the grass.

463
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,640
 He starts to see this tube of goo in other dreams.

464
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,000
 So at first he just starts seeing it in a few dreams.

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,280
 And now he's seeing it in dream after dream after dream.

466
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,080
 Tub of goo just floating around him.

467
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,040
 Now he's starting to see it in real life.

468
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
 He's really at school.

469
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,960
 He's really at flesh high.

470
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,840
 And the tube of goo is sitting on the desk next to him.

471
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,720
 Max is reporting that he is seeing this thing in real life.

472
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,960
 Now he's out on a date.

473
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
 He meets a pretty young girl.

474
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,480
 "Hey baby, you want to do a double date?"

475
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
 The girl's like, "What?

476
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,440
 It's just the two of us."

477
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
 He's like, "No."

478
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,760
 He's so emotionally in over to a floating tube of goo.

479
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,080
 Don't you have your own tube of goo?

480
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,920
 Let me tell you all about Elder Scrolls.

481
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,640
 Let me tell you about Elder Scrolls.

482
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 He'll start having dreams too.

483
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
 She runs away.

484
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,120
 He's seeing this tube of goo in real life.

485
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,120
 It's moved out of the dream into other dreams.

486
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
 Now he can see it all the time.

487
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,600
 He says that it's actually attached himself to his optical nerves.

488
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,080
 And it goes, "Don't worry."

489
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,240
 Now apparently it's Heath Ledger.

490
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,400
 Don't worry.

491
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,680
 I can see out of your eyeballs, but don't worry, I'm not going to possess you.

492
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
 Somebody stop me.

493
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,360
 He's doing all the impressions.

494
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,760
 So this thing is apparently able to do a full body possession, but it doesn't want to.

495
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,800
 He just wants to see what he sees and make it so visible to him.

496
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,440
 It has full access to all of his memories.

497
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,440
 And he says he's actually talked to his therapist about this.

498
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,720
 Which is interesting because the therapist doesn't know to make heads or tails of it.

499
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,800
 According to him, this was the quote, "I've told my therapist about this and she couldn't

500
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,280
 give me a concrete answer."

501
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,160
 And then I like to imagine the quote continues and then I saw the tube of goo's therapist

502
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
 and it said, "Everything's okay.

503
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,000
 Everything's A-okay.

504
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,560
 The tube of goo therapist agrees the tube of goo should be in your eyeballs."

505
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,080
 To wrap all this up, there's another detail because of course there has to be another

506
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,240
 detail.

507
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,320
 He says that he feels like a father-daughter relationship with this thing.

508
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 He's feminized it.

509
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,080
 It does sound like a monotone 30-year-old woman and it's a tube of goo and he brought

510
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
 it into the world.

511
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,880
 So he feels like he's a father and it's a daughter.

512
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,480
 It's his child.

513
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,400
 And it has a feminine voice.

514
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,240
 It's a floating tube of goo.

515
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
 He's banged it.

516
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,920
 He admits that he's had sex with this thing or gotten sexual with it a couple times.

517
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,120
 I don't know how you have sex with the hallucination.

518
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,600
 I've never tried it.

519
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
 I've never tried it.

520
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,120
 I don't know.

521
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,400
 If it's looking out of your eyeball, I mean you guys can both watch a sexy movie together,

522
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,000
 but he's imagining it floating around and he's walking around with a boner or something.

523
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,040
 He's just bumping into the wall or is he just doing air?

524
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,840
 Is he doing bulk squat thrust in the air?

525
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 Nice callback, right?

526
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,240
 Good thing you're the Patreon.

527
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,560
 And then what?

528
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,840
 And then he just imagines the tube of goo just being like, "Just get it over with.

529
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,120
 Just get it over with."

530
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,240
 And then I'm just going to go to sleep.

531
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,000
 I don't understand how you have sex with the hallucination.

532
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
 At that point it's kind of a tulpa.

533
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,080
 He does say that he's summoned tulpas before.

534
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,720
 But yeah, he's banging this thing that he admits he thinks of as a daughter because it sounds

535
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
 like a 30-year-old woman.

536
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,800
 I keep saying this guy is young.

537
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,080
 He might be 60 years old, so he assumes 30-year-old women are young enough to be skits.

538
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
 Who knows?

539
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,320
 But the point is, the point, let's wrap this up.

540
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,360
 A man has a dream about a tube of flesh.

541
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,320
 It comes inside of him.

542
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,920
 All of a sudden he can see it in other dreams.

543
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,080
 Now he can see it in the real world, so of course he starts banging it and calls it his

544
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
 daughter.

545
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,160
 He's seeing a therapist as well.

546
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
 So that's good.

547
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,680
 All this stuff that's working, I'm never anti-therapy.

548
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,400
 And I'm not joking about that.

549
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,560
 You should go see a therapist if you need to see one.

550
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,840
 If you're having lie, what do they call it, open eye hallucinations, it's probably a

551
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,000
 good idea to see a therapist.

552
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,040
 But let's put on our conspiracy cap here to wrap this up.

553
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,720
 This kid, obviously, if we were looking in the world of the paranormal and it's not some

554
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:50,160
 sort of mental issue, this guy went to another realm in his subconscious and invoked something.

555
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,960
 And that's really the big thing they always talk about when you're talking about demons,

556
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,720
 when you're talking about paranormal activity, you never want to invite it in.

557
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,800
 That's exactly what it did.

558
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,880
 It asked for permission, he invited it into his body and brought it into the real world.

559
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,440
 And now he's, I mean you could say paying the consequence for it.

560
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,720
 He is having sex regularly with a floating tube of goo.

561
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,840
 Again, it's very gross that he thinks of it as his child.

562
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,160
 If it, just don't think, I can't even unbox that.

563
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,360
 The point is, is that, let's go back to the paranormal thing, because that's less distressing

564
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
 to me.

565
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,000
 The point is, is that, you had this dream and he saw this tube of goo and it flew inside

566
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,960
 of him and now it has the option of possessing him and it's choosing not to.

567
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,600
 It appeared in this very demonic way, this very fleshy, eldritch realm and it looks monstrous

568
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,200
 and it's floating around.

569
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,640
 And maybe that's what he's into.

570
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,840
 Maybe he does subscribe to that Flesh World magazine.

571
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,280
 He's into banging tubes of goo.

572
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,640
 But wouldn't it make more sense, and this is where the creepiness comes into, that if

573
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,880
 something wanted to get to you, it doesn't appear in your dreams as some mid-boss from

574
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,680
 a video game.

575
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,680
 But it appears as a loved one.

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,640
 Someone you've always wanted to have by your side, but you've never been able to get them.

577
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,000
 Someone who you cherish.

578
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,720
 They appear to you in a dream.

579
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,280
 You're so glad to be with them.

580
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:26,760
 You're so glad to feel that warmth, that love in a totally normal location, not covered

581
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,400
 in goo.

582
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,520
 It's a sunny day and you're with someone you really care about and you're holding their

583
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,240
 hand, you're walking with them.

584
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,880
 And they turn to you and they go, "I love the time we're spending together, but you're

585
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,280
 gonna wake up soon.

586
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,600
 Just hold my hand.

587
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
 Don't let go.

588
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,560
 Will you do that?

589
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:56,960
 Will you hold on to me until your eyes open and you're awake again?"

590
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
 And of course you will.

591
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,160
 You love them.

592
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,000
 You realize that this is a dream and in the real world you don't have this relationship

593
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,360
 with them.

594
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,480
 So you hold them close, you hold them tight.

595
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,960
 You hold them until you wake up, alone in your bed.

596
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,800
 See nothing but the memory of being next to them.

597
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:31,760
 But that was simply a disguise for something dark and cold, crafted by eternal loneliness

598
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,920
 and despair.

599
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:42,880
 Not all possessions start with a demon crawling out of the darkness or a Ouija board event

600
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
 at 3 AM.

601
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:53,440
 What if the most successful demonic possessions are the ones you don't even know happened?

602
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,920
 So when you begin seeing a shadowy figure standing next to you at the supermarket or

603
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,400
 a glimmer of a shape in your rear view mirror as you're driving down the highway or right

604
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:13,960
 before you shut off your light when you go to bed, you see movement in the farthest corner

605
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,120
 of your room.

606
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,960
 You think it's just a trick of the light, your eyes are tired, you are just imagining

607
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
 something.

608
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,480
 But no.

609
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,480
 You are seeing the physical representation of something you invited into your body.

610
00:31:36,480 --> 00:32:05,600
 It disguised itself as a loved one, but instead it will soon become your greatest enemy.

611
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:21,640
 So when you're in the dark, you're seeing the physical representation of something you

612
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:42,920
 invited into your body.

613
00:32:42,920 --> 00:33:00,360
 So when you're in the dark, you're seeing the physical representation of something you

614
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,720
