00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 An urban legend featuring one of America's greatest fast food icons.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at a mysterious hole in Bulgaria.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Does this cavernous tunnel actually lead us to the first human being today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 You guys are having a great day too, but they're jackhammering outside of this apartment right now.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm staying at my mom's house on vacation and I don't know if it's coming across on the recording.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It looks like it is based on the sound waves, but we're just gonna have to go with it

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 because I have a family event tonight. I can't record an episode later tonight, so we're just gonna have to do this.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It sounds too bad I'll delete it, but let's go ahead and get started here.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 The first story I want to talk about is... it's funny because I thought about breaking it up into two segments

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 and I was like, "No, you can't even talk about it all."

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So the first story we're gonna talk about, hop on board the Carpenter Copter.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 No jackhammer is allowed. Leave those. Leave it.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Construction worker who's listening to this podcast, put it down.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're gonna hop on board the Carpenter Copter. We are going to a random KFC somewhere in America.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 The year, well the decade is the 60s. We're in the 1960s. We're sitting in the KFC.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Now there had been a story going around among employees at Kentucky Fried Chickens that

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 there's been a man dressed up in a Colonel Sanders suit.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 An old man in a Colonel Sanders suit has been stopping by Kentucky Fried Chickens and flipping out.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And you know, you got all these teenagers working at these Kentucky Fried Chickens and they're like,

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 "I don't know if that's true," but it had been going through the grapevine that a man had been dressed up as Colonel Sanders.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 For people who don't know who Colonel Sanders is, he's an old man, he wears a white...

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Colonel Sanders is actually like the actual human being, is quite fascinating guy.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I had to do a bunch of research on him for this segment.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 He started, he like started work at the age of 13. He lied about his age to get into the military.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 One of those type of guys. He ended up like, he got a job at a train company, beat a guy up on the train,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 got fired from a train company, decided to get his law degree, gets his law degree, fights his own clients.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Gets kicked out, gets disbarred from being a lawyer.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Couldn't find more information on that. It's fascinating as that segment sounds.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He had all of these failure, like he'd have this success and then a failure.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 His success and a failure all throughout his life.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 He finally started working at a gas station that had a restaurant attached to it.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 He started making chicken and it was super popular.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And what happened was he started to open up other businesses and then he thought,

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 you know what, I'm going to be smart about this. I'm going to sell my, I'm going to franchise my idea.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And I'm going to make four cents per piece of chicken that's sold.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So his gravy recipe, his chicken recipe, his corn cob recipe, all of that stuff.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He began to franchise out, made tons of money doing it.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And then sold the company for like $2 million or something like that later on.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Oh, oh, and actually I should say this part of the reason why he succeeded in business was because

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 one of his employees got murdered by a rival restaurant.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 There was, he had a shoe, him and an employee had a shootout with a rival restaurant and their employee.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And the owner of the other restaurant shot Colonel Sanders employees.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Totally true story. And he died.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So his rival went to prison and then Colonel Sanders, and he's not a real Colonel.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It's like a Kentucky Colonel, which is like an honorary thing, but his rival goes to prison.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So then he dominated the local food area.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 The, like he dominated the local food market and then people had nowhere to go in the area, but for his chicken and it just kind of blew up from there.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So murder, intrigue, failure and success. The whole story of Colonel Sanders is there.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But anyways, he sold the company and he always had that trademark white suit, little goatee and stuff like that.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He started later in life. He wouldn't even leave the house without that suit.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And you had to address his Colonel, by the way.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 So everyone kind of knows what Colonel Sanders looked like.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 You can just look at the silhouette or the icon and go, oh, that's Colonel Sanders, right?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But there was a man dressed up in a Colonel Sanders suit in the 60s and the 70s, walking into Kentucky Fried Chicken and just being like,

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I'd like a two piece of the chicken and some gravy and a corn on the cob, please. Thank you, ma'am.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And then he would get his meal and he'd walk down and he'd sit at his table and he would take a bite of chicken and be like, just crap.

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 This is crap. And I'm actually churching it up because he was cussing nonstop.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 He's like, this is garbage, man. Flipping the throne, the gravy.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 He's like, this is like eating wallpaper. This is disgusting.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And he would just tear ass through the Kentucky Fried Chicken, knocking over all their stuff and he would leave.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And the kids who worked there would be like, what in the world just happened? How is this, who was that guy?

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And then across town a couple days later, a couple weeks later, a guy in a Colonel Sanders suit will walk into a Kentucky Fried Chicken.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I'd like a two piece of chicken wings, ma'am, and my accent changed a bit, but that's because I'm so hungry.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Some gravy, please. And they're like, he'd sit down, he started eating it.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Do the same thing. Flip out. Cuss everyone out in the store, storm out.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 People started saying, hey man, you gotta be on the lookout for this guy dressed up as Colonel Sanders.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It gets to corporate office and they go, oh no, no, no, we're totally aware of that dude.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 He's actually the Colonel Sanders. Colonel Sanders, after he sold the company, years later they started changing the recipes to his stuff.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 The food that he'd labored over so long for, the food that got an employee of his shot.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 In front of him, he said they started using tap water for the gravy. The gravy was the pride.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He used to say the gravy was so good you could eat it with no chicken, you just spoon it in your mouth.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And then they started making all these cost cutting things.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So he would go into basically his own restaurant that had pictures of himself on the restaurant and say the food was trash.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And throw people and then storm out. So they couldn't really kick him out. It would be really bad for the brand.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But it was known within the company that if a guy came in in a Colonel Sanders suit, started just destroying the place.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Just let it be because it's the real Colonel Sanders and it's not worth the publicity to find out that the man who invented your restaurant hates it now.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But you know what, actually, here we go. I have another Colonel Sanders story that involves a ghost.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Oh, is it a ghost? Maybe a ghost. We're going to save that for tomorrow. We're actually going to do a two parter on Colonel Sanders.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 We're starting off with the Colonel Sanders urban legend. Was Colonel Sanders destroying KFC restaurants in the 60s and 70s? That's true.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Tomorrow you will find out about the curse of Colonel Sanders.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And I will say this, since I investigated the curse of Colonel Sanders every single night, I get a mysterious Google update on my phone.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 But we'll talk about that tomorrow. Two parter on Colonel Sanders. I bet you didn't expect that when you turned on dead rabbit radio.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Let's move on to our next story. Now our next story is actually a request.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It was a request from Corpse Glitch via Gmail. Now Corpse Glitch, I'm still going through my emails.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 If you sent me a request like months ago, it's still in the docket. So don't think, oh, sometimes the request turned around is super fast.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Sometimes it takes a little bit while. It really depends on what time of day you catch me.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 But okay, and I'm interrupting here real quick. This is recorded the next day. This story was actually recommended by another person as well.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I want to make sure everyone gets the credit.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 The story was also recommended by the real guy, the best guy on YouTube, both him and Corpse Glitch recommended the story.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And I get so many recommendations. Sometimes things get lost in the shuffle, but I wanted to make sure that I wanted to make sure the real guy, the best guy got credit as well.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So we're jumping back into the story. I'm not going to mention him again, because like I said, I recorded the entire episode and I mentioned Corpse Glitch,

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 but I wanted to make sure that the real guy, the best guy got credit as well.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Okay, on with the episode. Corpse Glitch sent me this request via Gmail. So thank you Corpse Glitch.

96
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So the topic is this. We're going to be looking at, and I'm going to mispronounce this and you're sorry guys, the Sorry China Hole.

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So let's hop it back on board the Carbentercopter. We got some KFC to go. We got the big buck. I haven't eaten KFC for so long.

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I do like their gravy though, and I've never had his traditional gravy, so I'm wondering how good that stuff was.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But like gravy mashed potatoes, and their chicken's good, but I prefer like chicken strips.

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So we got a bunch of chicken strips. Oh dude, honey barbecue chicken strips, bro. We got honey barbecue chicken strips, and we're flying around.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Now my fingers are all greasy and the controls, to be fair, I don't have my pilot's license.

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I guess I should have told you that 263 episodes ago, but we're flying around on the Carbentercopter.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Fingers are sticky, but they're finger licking good. I'm actually licking the controls of the helicopter.

104
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 You're like Jason, just fly to the next story. So that's a plane. Now they're hammering outside of my apartment. That's beautiful.

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 We're flying over to Sorry China Hole. Now Sorry China Hole is a little interesting place.

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's interesting whether or not the other stuff is true. The history of the hole itself is fascinating.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So Sorry China Hole, we land in the middle of Bulgaria.

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 We jump off the Carbentercopter, and we are in Sorry China, which is a village in western Bulgaria.

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 What happens is, you know what's funny is that, okay, so let me just tell you the story and then we'll start dissecting it.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Because sometimes when I take notes, I don't realize the flaws in the story, but then once I start talking about it, I'm like, what? That is what makes it.

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Sorry China Hole is in western Bulgaria. It's by the village of, sorry China.

112
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 So what happened was back in 1990, the Ministry of Defense for Bulgaria said, we want to excavate, we believe that in this hill or piece of ground, piece of earth, there is the lost treasure of King Samuel.

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Samuel, Samuel. So King Samuel was a huge, great Bulgarian warlord. Which I can mean. Like what do they have? Two of them?

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Anyways, I mean, it's not like they've made, not like Bulgaria made their mark on the history of Europe. How many warlords did Bulgaria have?

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Anyways, they had them in Count Dracula. Right, I don't know if I have any subscribers in Bulgaria, and if I do, I apologize.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 But if I don't, we can all laugh at their country. But if I do, I apologize.

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 So anyways, King Samuel was this great Bulgarian warlord, and he did all bunch of stuff. He was conquering stuff and da da da da da.

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So anyways, that stuff's not that interesting, because in 1014, he was crushed. He was destroyed at the battle of Clydeon.

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Now it's funny, because this story I'm about to tell you, I heard as a kid and it absolutely terrified me. And I'm going to tell you, 100% true, I'm going to tell you this story, it's going to terrify you too.

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So King Samuel was fighting some more powerful enemy, and he was successful a couple times, but as wars go on, you're going to be suffered a defeat here and there.

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Anyways, the battle of Clydeon, it was this totally, I read all about it, but I'm not going to bore you with the details.

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 A bunch of people stabbed each other, a bunch of catapults and stuff like that. I don't know if they had catapults, but anyways, it was a medieval warfare, which is cool.

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 This isn't a medieval warfare podcast, so I'm going to spare you all the details.

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The detail I'm going to tell you is the scary part. So his soldiers lose the battle, and 15,000 of his men are captured.

125
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So they're like, "I give up, I give up stronger enemy from any other country around Bulgaria that could have been Estonia, for all I know."

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 But anyways, the point is, Bulgaria loses, they surrender, 15,000 men are captured, right?

127
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 This rival country, they take their 15,000 soldiers and they put them in groups of 100. My dad told me the story as a kid.

128
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They took 15,000 troops, they divide them up into groups of 100, and they would go into this group and they would take one guy out and stab him in one eyeball.

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Oh my eye, oh my god, I am so unlucky. How did I get picked one out of 100 to get my eye stabbed down?

130
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 But as you were sitting there holding, I should have made you pick a number between one and 100.

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 As you're sitting there holding your one eye that's just been stabbed down, you notice that the 99 other people in your group are having both eyes stabbed out.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Just stabbing eyeballs. And what it was was, the enemy general said, "One guy with one eye can lead the other 99 guys back home."

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So I'm gonna blind 99 people and I'm gonna leave one person with one eye and I'm gonna do that, what is that?

134
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 1,500 times, because there was 15,000 soldiers total and then they got to like do this daisy chain.

135
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Now, their home was over a mountain range. It wasn't like a mile walk back to the kingdom.

136
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 You had one guy with one eye leading 99 guys with no eyes over mountain ranges and you just had masses of people.

137
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So if you happen to stop holding the hand of the person in front of you, you're kind of boned.

138
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And if you're the middle of that chain, the 49 people behind you are also boned. There's no way they're making home.

139
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 They end up, the remnants of the army, whoever actually makes it over, gets back to the kingdom and King Samuel sees it and he's so freaked out by what happened to these men, he has a heart attack and he dies.

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And that was the end of the great Bulgarian warlord, King Samuel.

141
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 But the myth, so I find that story very fascinating and terrifying as well, but have a happy night's sleep in tonight.

142
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 The myth is that he had some gold or some treasure, I guess to be more specific.

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 He had some treasure buried in, sorry, China. He had some gold, he had some steam, he had some treasure buried in sorry, China.

144
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And so the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense said, "Let's find that treasure," which made me think that their Ministry of Defense needed something to do on a Tuesday.

145
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Because that's really not what the Ministry of Defense should be up to. They shouldn't be on Goonies style treasure hunts.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 They should be, you know, like administering defense for their country.

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 But they weren't, they were all doing the truffle shuffle and they went down to this place to dig up this gold.

148
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So they started that in 1990. In 1992, two years later, they said, "Yeah, there's nothing down there. Total waste of money."

149
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 They started excavating with equipment, but eventually they, the excavators couldn't go any deeper.

150
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So you had soldiers using pickaxes and shovels.

151
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And after two years, they said, "That's not worth it. We're not going to find any gold. We've been doing it for two years. Nothing down here."

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So they came back up and they sealed the hole shut with concrete. And that was it.

153
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Now, I think that part of the story is true. Could be all made up, but let's assume that part of the story is true at least.

154
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So that's the end of the story of Sorry China. Or is it?

155
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Because this is where we start to get into the myth of this. And this is really what Corpse Glitch was getting at.

156
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And nobody cares about a bunch of military people digging a hole and then quitting. This is the conspiracy theory.

157
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They end up making the hole 590 feet long. Okay? It's a long hole.

158
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Apparently, the Ministry of Defense had actually had three remote viewers also working on the project,

159
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 which again sounds like something stupid a government would do because remote viewing is, for the most part, a waste of time and money.

160
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I believe there are some people out there who can do it, but I don't...

161
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The chances of you rounding up three of them is highly unlikely.

162
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I'll do an episode on remote viewing in the future. It's one of those things that I'm like, "Yeah, it probably could work."

163
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But there's probably no more than five people on the planet who could do it at any given time.

164
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So I don't believe... I think probably maybe one of them was real and the other two were just pretending.

165
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They're like, "Uh, I see... I see dirt and I see a dark hole in your future."

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And they're like, "Whoa, man, you're amazing." He's like, "I see... I see a rock in front of you."

167
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And they're like, "Well, yeah, I was digging and there was a rock there. Who would have known except for a remote viewer?"

168
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Anyway, so they're digging this tunnel and apparently they come across a long... a tunnel they didn't dig.

169
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So they're digging one tunnel and it breaks into another tunnel that's a long spiral-shaped tunnel.

170
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So I don't know if it's like a spiral staircase going down or if the tunnel itself is spirally.

171
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Again, the details... It's weird. There's a lot of specifics, but there's no... not a lot of details.

172
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Like, what does a spiral-shaped tunnel mean?

173
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 They continue down this tunnel and they find... they find unknown lettering.

174
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They find a language that they don't understand written on a stone slab.

175
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And they're like, "That's weird. Let's keep on digging, though. That's not a warning sign. Let's keep on digging."

176
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 No photos of the slab, by the way. Spoiler alert. There's no photos of that. They keep digging.

177
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 They find a giant new slab. That one was the old slab.

178
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 That was just an old rectangular slab with alien language on it.

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 They find another slab and this one was in the shape of like a concave lens.

180
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Okay? And it has a picture of a... what's described as a giant human on it.

181
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Now, based on just a picture drawn on a wall, I don't know if you could figure out whether or not it was a giant human

182
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 or a regular sized human. They don't have anyone for scale.

183
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 They just see a giant picture of a human, but the story is that it was supposed to be a giant beyond this concave lens slab.

184
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 This one, they move out of the way. They get a couple of brawny guards, military people, whatever, and they're like,

185
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 [Maniacal Scream]

187
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And they move it out of the way, right? And at that moment, they are hit with a bright light.

188
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 [Maniacal Scream]

189
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 I shouldn't have moved that slab with that giant human. Ah, the alien warning must have said giant light behind this thing.

190
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I should have said that when I talked about the slab, but the reason why is that nobody knows what it says.

191
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 A lot of people are putting their own things on what supposedly was in this hole.

192
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Anyways, so they move the giant slab, they get hit with a big beam of light.

193
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 They see a tunnel now. Now they see like another clear tunnel that they can walk down.

194
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And one of the guys goes, "Oh, clear sailing, right? We can walk down this tunnel."

195
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 He walks down the tunnel and he's pushed back by an invisible force.

196
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So he tries to walk down the tunnel again. He's pushed back by an invisible force.

197
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 He's like, "Third time to charm, right? He's looking back at the other military guys."

198
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 They're like, "Don't do it, bro. Don't do it."

199
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 He walks again down the tunnel, pushed back by an invisible force.

200
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So at this point, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense calls up Baba Vagna.

201
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Now, Baba Vagna is a probably a pretty famous name for people who follow paranormal stuff.

202
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And on YouTube, Mircea actually requested that I do a story on Baba Vagna.

203
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Now, I'm familiar with Baba Vagna. The name pops up quite often in paranormal research.

204
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I'm going to do a brief overview on her. She was a Bulgarian mystic clairvoyant soothsayer.

205
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 She could see in the future. She was a healer, things like that.

206
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 She's actually really controversial in the paranormal world because we see a lot of prophecies attributed to her,

207
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 but she wrote nothing down. So people say she predicted 9/11.

208
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 She predicted the Kursk submarine, that Russian submarine that sank to the ground.

209
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 She predicted all this stuff. She never wrote anything down.

210
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And her family members have actually said she never predicted 9/11.

211
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 She never predicted World War III.

212
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 A lot of the prophecies we see come from Baba Vagna are fake.

213
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And since she didn't write anything down, it can never be cross-roofed.

214
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So she was really a psychic. She was a personal psychic.

215
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 You would come to her, she would tell you something.

216
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But when you see stuff online saying she predicted this, she predicted that, no she didn't.

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 People would come visit her, she would talk to them, stuff like that,

218
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 but she wrote nothing down. She made no predictions like Nostradamus where she was saying,

219
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 "This is what's going to happen a thousand years from now," and all that stuff.

220
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So it's really hard to take anything credible that she says,

221
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 but she's such a recognizable name that she gets put into lore all the time.

222
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And she pops up in this story.

223
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Apparently, the Bulgarian Minister of Defense went to Baba Vagna and said,

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 "This is what happened. We walked past the slab.

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It had this stuff on it saying that there's some sort of biological entity in here

226
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 that is bad for us that will kill humanity."

227
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 We moved to Concave Slab, got hit with a beam of light,

228
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 tried to walk down the hallway, got, you know, repelled, and she goes,

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 "Yeah, I can see in the future. I knew all that stuff was going to happen before you even did it."

230
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Okay? Don't waste my time. Don't waste your time. Don't waste my time.

231
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Very, very important psychic.

232
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And I saw the future and I knew you were going to waste my time.

233
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So this conversation I already had in my head.

234
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 You piss me off. Shut up. Okay? She puts her finger on their lips.

235
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I'm going to tell you what's down that tunnel.

236
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Down that tunnel is a skeleton.

237
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 A giant skeleton. And they're like,

238
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 "Well, that explains the giant picture."

239
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And she's like, "Please just shut up for a second. Don't interrupt me."

240
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 That giant skeleton is the first human, the proto-human.

241
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 She turns around now. She has this huge PowerPoint display ready for the generals in the military defense.

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 She goes, "Lookit, slide number one. This is the proto-human. This is the first human.

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 It's neither man nor woman. It's both and neither.

244
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And it exists in this cave system. And listen to me. You cannot disturb this.

245
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 It actually could be the end of humanity if you do."

246
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 She shuts off her laser pointer and they're like, "Fascinating."

247
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And she goes, "I knew you'd say that."

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Now, there's actually a story out there that she gave even more detail about this proto-human.

249
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 That she had another slide ready in her PowerPoint. She goes, "Click."

250
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 The proto-human is actually from another planet. You see? Another planet.

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You see, what is in the proto-human is actually the DNA that was used to create the human race.

252
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 That's why it's both man nor woman. So it's both human and alien.

253
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It's the beginning of everything and it proves that we originated from another planet.

254
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And it's being guarded by those sorts of forces. Aliens, UFOs, things like that.

255
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So don't open up this tunnel anymore. Don't try to get down there.

256
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 It will end badly for you and possibly all of us.

257
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 So I've seen the most common version of the story is Baba Vagna just saying,

258
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 "It's a skeleton that's both man and woman. Now leave."

259
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And then there's versions that are more detailed where she's basically like,

260
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 "No, it's from an alien planet."

261
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 But anyways, either way, the Ministry of Defense leaves Baba Vagna's hut

262
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and they're like, "Okay, we're not going to do that anymore."

263
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And actually one of the remote viewers supposedly quit after hearing this information,

264
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 which again lends credence to my theory that only one of them was real,

265
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 the other two people just wanted to paycheck.

266
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So after that whole story, the Ministry of Defense seals the hole with concrete and disappears.

267
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And one more according to legend. This is a quote from Wikipedia.

268
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'm going to read it in full because it says a lot about the topic we're covering.

269
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 "The findings of a 2007 BTV... BTV is Bulgarian television."

270
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I don't know why I find that hilarious.

271
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 There's MTV, that's cool. BTV?

272
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Anyways, quote, "The findings of a 2007 BTV documentary on the Sorry China project

273
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 revealed that most of the military documents surrounding the event

274
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 had disappeared from government archives or had since been destroyed."

275
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Citation needed.

276
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And that sums up the whole story.

277
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 The whole story should basically have every article should end with citation needed.

278
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 We're really going off a lot of rumors with this story.

279
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 There is an addition to the story, so the tunnel ended in 1992, the digging ended in 1992.

280
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 In 1993, apparently, a group of students from the University of Sofia go there.

281
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Sofia, that's a local university.

282
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 They see UFOs, they see poldergeist, weird combination.

283
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 They see a pumpkin-shaped light floating around and to cap it all off.

284
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Tell me if this isn't spooky, tell me if this doesn't send chills up your spine.

285
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 The researchers start a campfire one night, they leave it unattended.

286
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 They leave the campfire unattended for four minutes, apparently.

287
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Camp catches on fire. Camp site catches on fire.

288
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And the article I got that from was saying, "Isn't it weird that the camp caught on fire

289
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 but none of the trees around it caught on fire?

290
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Could it possibly be the aliens warding them off?"

291
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 No, it's just not knowing how to use a fire.

292
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 It's not knowing how, it's not knowing basic fire safety.

293
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 If aliens are responsible because you don't know how to, that you shouldn't leave a fire unattended,

294
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 don't leave fires unattended in the wilderness.

295
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Don't do that. That's not aliens.

296
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But anyway, so this is called...

297
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 This story is known as, this location is known as Bulgaria's Area 51.

298
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Come on, it's a hole in the ground covered in concrete.

299
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 If that's your Area 51, if that's your most notable place as far as paranormal goes as a hole in the ground,

300
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 that may not even be there, it may just be a patch of concrete.

301
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Oh, Bulgaria. I don't know what to do with you guys.

302
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I'm sure you guys are a decent country, but come on, it's a hole in the ground, Area 51.

303
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 But despite all of that, despite all of my misgivings about the story,

304
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I think it's interesting to think that some people went digging for gold

305
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and instead reached an impassable hallway that may have contained the first human protected behind it.

306
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 But what's even more interesting is if they never got the inkling that there was any treasure down there,

307
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 they never got a hint from a remote viewer that there was something down there,

308
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 they never would have went down there in the first place.

309
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And that story of that skeleton would have never been revealed to the world,

310
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 because no one would have ever had a reason to start digging in the first place.

311
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 It makes you wonder how many other lost chambers could be right beneath our feet right now.

312
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Wouldn't we walk about our daily lives?

313
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But do these caves also have some sort of defense system?

314
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They were never supposed to be discovered in the first place,

315
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 but if they were, there were fail safes set up.

316
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 First, things that would warn you from going further,

317
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 and then things that would actively repel you from going forward.

318
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But like any fail safe, they too can fail.

319
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And it makes me wonder, what if no one went digging for this treasure?

320
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 That this skeleton protected by all of these measures just sat there in the dark.

321
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But then an earthquake comes and splits the earth open.

322
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 No one saw the tablet, no one was repelled by the force.

323
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Just one day, the people of Sarichina fall ill.

324
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 A disease begins to spread across the country of Bulgaria.

325
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Within weeks it's ravaged Europe.

326
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Within months, humanity has fallen.

327
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I don't know how many earthquakes happen in Bulgaria.

328
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I don't know how many hidden chambers with deadly secrets exist under the planet's surface.

329
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But all it takes is a combination of one bad natural event.

330
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 One hidden time bomb.

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And these stories are no longer myths or mysteries.

332
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 These stories are the end of humanity.

333
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 There could be ticking time bombs all over right underneath our feet.

334
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And it's only a matter of time until one of these cursed objects gets loose.

335
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
