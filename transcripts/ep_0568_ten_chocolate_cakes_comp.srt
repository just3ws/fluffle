1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
 A mystery in Florida may go deeper than we think.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,040
 And then we travel to a quaint little house in Bracknell, England.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,880
 When some people showed up to do repairs and no one answered the door, they feared the

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
 worst.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,000
 What they ended up finding inside was straight up weird.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you guys have a really fun week.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 As you can see for Fan Art Friday this week, I've chosen to put a meme, the very first

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio meme ever made.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 It was made by Trapper Jamboree and they posted it on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 In case you can't read it, in case you're driving, try to sleep.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's a picture from Insidious of that demon poking its head out from behind that dude

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 and it says, "When you're listening to Jason Carpenter try to pronounce your name and he

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 accidentally summons an ancient demon."

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So thank you so much Trapper Jamboree.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Gotta say I never thought I'd be memed in any way shape or form.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So that's awesome, really, really appreciate it.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Let's also give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Hoshi.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Everyone give a round of applause for Hoshi running in, doing somersaults and stuff like

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 that's wrestling me.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Dude, dude.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Hoshi is going to be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Hoshi, I'm going to look over at you.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I toss you the keys of the Jason Jalopy.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We are headed out to the Conspiracy Theory iceberg and along the way we're going to stop

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 at Brevard County, Florida.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Hoshi is going to drive us on out to Florida.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's a cool road trip.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We're listening to a bunch of hit songs for any spirits and just having fun.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Taking photos of ourselves in the Grand Canyon and Mount Rushmore even though those are

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 totally out of the way.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We eventually get to Florida.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We're in Brevard County, Florida.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I want to give a shout out to that weirdo on Twitter, aka Jack for putting together the

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Conspiracy Theory list.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He sent me the link so I could share it with you, but I lost the link.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So if you're listening to this Jack, if you can send me that link again, I can start putting

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 in the show notes.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But I go through the list every once in a while.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It makes it so much easier to compile.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I always want to give a shout out to Jack when I am able to pull something off of this

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 because we're in Conspiracy iceberg County right now.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 The year is 1982.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 When we're walking around Brevard County, we're dressed up as construction workers.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 We got on our little hard hats.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 We're dressed up like village people construction workers.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So we just have like a denim jacket, no sleeves.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We're not getting any work done.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're just posing.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 There actually is a whole work crew there so we can continue to pose.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 They're moving like machines and stuff, the driving.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 They're not actually pushing them.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Driving machines, giant bulldozers.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And then there's like a crane.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I guess there's a crane there.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 That's the chain, janglin.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And then there's a backhoe.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I actually don't know what a backhoe is, but I think it's the one with the claw, right?

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So there's this guy working the levers and he's doing all this stuff.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And then the giant claw thing is like, he's hoping to get a stuffed animal.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He's like, oh man, he's accidentally picking up construction workers instead.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 He's like, I don't want you.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The big claw thing, he's going into the mud.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I guess I should have said they're currently at like this kind of wetland kind of a bog.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 They're going to build a structure over it.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 So they're just fooling around.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's just like, hey, what are you doing today?

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Oh, we're going to take the backhoe out, destroy environments.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 The backhoe is coming in, goes into the mud and the dude pulls it up and he looks and he's like, oh wait.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And inside of this bucket full of mud and sticks and reeds and stuff like that are a couple human skulls.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He's like, okay.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 First he's like, he's looking for construction workers.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's counting their heads.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He's like, okay, I worked with 10 people.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I see 10 heads.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I didn't kill these guys.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Secondly, hey boss, come look at this.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Check out these skulls I found.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 So of course they shut down the work site.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Cops come in, they investigate it and they're looking at the skulls and they go, these skulls don't look fresh.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Actually to be fair, I don't think the police made that determination.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 One of them was like, oh, I made you to paleontology.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 The police investigated and they go, well, these aren't, at some point in the investigation, they find out these aren't fresh.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So then a bunch of like anthropologist dudes show up and they're like looking around poking it with tweezers.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And they realize that these skulls are actually between 8 to 9,000 years old.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Peek your interest there.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Or peat your interest.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Because this isn't peat something in a bog.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Isn't it like moss or something?

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Anyways, through their investigation, they end up uncovering 168 nearly perfectly preserved bodies in this bog.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Now there's a little asterisk and even by saying nearly preserved, you have the bog people of Europe where they would bury people by throwing them in the bog or kill them by throwing them in the bog.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Or people are just taking a nap, they're like, no Larry, you're napping on the bog.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 They're constantly finding bodies and bogs over in Europe.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And those guys will have like eyebrows and all their clothes on and stuff like that.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They're waking up.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 They've been dead for thousands of years or hundreds of years depending on the bog.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But they're really well preserved.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 These guys, they aren't super well preserved.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 They don't have all their flesh, but they were able to pull brain matter out of some of these guys.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They found the skeletons almost intact.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And that was an unusual thing.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 When they were talking about how well preserved they were, you'd have brain tissue in some of them,

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 but the skeletons would look like someone just got all their skin melted off and just fell down.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Like Mars attacks or something like that.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And that's normally not the case.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 There's like one bunch of scavengers.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 The way they had these bodies pinned down, they had like sticks making a triangle so the body couldn't rise above the triangle.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And the thing was, was that it got to the, I guess the soil wasn't any good to dig in.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I guess that was just the easiest way to drop bodies in the bog instead of digging holes everywhere.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Scientists were able to determine there were some families that used this bog for multiple generations.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So they're starting to piece this story together.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 They go, they're most likely Native Americans.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And some of the stories that you'll read about this, they try to spin it like, oh, their DNA was very, very rare.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And I was like, oh, that's cool.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yeah, it's very, very rare compared to the rest of the world, but it's like 20% of Native Americans have this DNA.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So I guess it sounds like I'm trying to flex on Native American DNA.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I'm not doing that.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I'm saying is some of the stories try to spin it off that it's a little more like Atlantean or Vikings or something like that.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 That's just not the case.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Like pretty common among indigenous people in America.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But you had, so they go, okay, so we have this tribe.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We don't know who it is.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 We have no idea who these people were.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Their culture is completely died out.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 There's no one we can ask about this.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 But we're going to have to assume they settled in this area for a long time because multiple generations of one family doing DNA testing.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 We can show that people were here long enough to bury their grandmas, their maws, their, what's the next thing, kids, grandkids.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You know what I mean?

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Not at all at the same time, but like the kids are burying their parents and then their kids are burying them.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And you know, you know how death works and generations work.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But then you started to notice some really interesting things.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 One, not a lot of them died of violence.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 There weren't a lot of cracked skulls.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 There were a couple.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But a lot of the people were dying of natural causes.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They found one woman, her stomach was intact and so was the food inside of it.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So they were able to cut her stomach open.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 They're like, "Eh, I wonder what they ate back then.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They're all eaten out of the stomach."

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They cut the stomach open.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 They found her last meal.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 They found like berries and stuff like that.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Nightshade, it might have been what killed her.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 But they found all these berries and stuff like that.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And the scientists were saying it looks like she was sick with something

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 and she was trying to cure herself with native medicine and it didn't work.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But you know, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You might not want to add nightshade to your medicine next time.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Another interesting thing they found was they found a skeleton with spinal bifida.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And that's where your spine kind of fuses together, your vertebrae.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's bad.

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The first time I ever heard about it was on Shallow Howl.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That dude was walking around and he had spinal bifida.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I guess the actor has spinal bifida in real life.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But it was supposed to be a contrast to Shallow Howl and how shallow he was.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And then you had spinal bifida boy.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I don't remember his name.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 But he was like this super cool guy and he was like a millionaire

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 and he had all these awesome friends and stuff like that.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And the point was he didn't care about anything.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He wasn't an anarchist, but he didn't let his limitations throttle his...

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I thought it was a really cool character.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And again, I'm watching him and I was like, "Whoa, what's that?"

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Someone's like, "Oh, that guy has spinal bifida."

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But yeah, he's like, "Oh, I don't care.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I'm going to go out and be successful in real life.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 He's an actor."

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So there's that.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I mean, like he's definitely not letting it get in his way.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But here we have Vectoriality back away from a romantic comedy.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Vectoriality.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 They found a skeleton of a boy who had spinal bifida.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 It's a genetic disease.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 People can get it.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 All different cultures, all different time periods in world history.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But this boy was 15 years old.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the scientists were like, "This is really weird."

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Because from what we know of most indigenous cultures,

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 if you have such a crippling illness, sorry, bro.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Like if it's a gatherer culture, 9,000 years ago,

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I mean, people are still just picking berries.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And they're like, "Hmm, I see that wheat growing over there.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Can I make that wheat grow over here?"

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And they're like, "Leave that question to the shamans."

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Like, I don't even think they're really doing agriculture

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 in most parts of the world at this point.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But you know what I mean?

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Normally indigenous cultures will say, "Hey, tough luck, dude.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Sorry."

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And you're not even going to make it past one years old.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But this dude was 15.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 They have found another skeleton that had a foot missing

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 that they could tell was removed long before they died.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 This was all healed up.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And they go, "That's another weird indicator."

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Because normally if you suffered a grievous injury like that,

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 they're like, "Pfft, you saw what we did to the guy with spinal bifida, man.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 You know, that's just the way things go."

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So this tribe seemed to have a really caring community.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And nobody knows who they are.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Nobody will ever really know who they are.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 They existed in Brevard County, Florida.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They stopped building the shopping mall, by the way.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Now it's a protected area.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But that is on the conspiracy theory.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I spent a minute going, "Jay, so that's an interesting story.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 A lost tribe of people."

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 It's not interesting in the sense that they have a genetic code

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 that's never been seen before on the planet Earth, or da-da-da-da-da.

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 But it's interesting for another reason that almost seems glossed over.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I actually read three articles on this, and it wasn't until I got to the third one

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 that I saw any hints of this.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And I think this is why it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Again, that story is interesting in and of itself.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But is a conspiracy iceberg interesting?

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Listen to this.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 They're digging up the bog.

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Scientists are going through taking the little brushes, cleaning off schools,

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 cataloging everything.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Some of the bodies were buried with toys.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I'm sure there are like thrown footballs around.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 They're like, "Come on, man, that's a 9,000-year-old football.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Give me a chance."

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And the supervisor grabs it and he's running away with it.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Yet all this stuff going on, the bodies were discovered in 1982.

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They only dug up half of the site.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 They dug up 168 bodies and quit.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 100% just said, "We're done digging this site up."

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So it's a protected area, and they know there's more bodies in there.

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So why did they stop digging this site up?

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The official answer is they said, "Here's the thing.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 This is an amazing find, but we're limited to the DNA technology we have in 1983-1984."

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We are going to preserve half of this site.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 We're not going to let anyone into it.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 We're going to get our two beefiest scientists to stand outside day and night.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Nobody can dig in this second patch of mud where we know there's more bodies at

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 for 50 or maybe 100 years.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Scientists kind of packed everything up and went home.

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And you're like, "Wait, that doesn't make sense.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Why 50 to 100 years?"

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And they go, "DNA technology, like we were explaining before, before you made the joke

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 about the scientists, DNA technology isn't that advanced, but in 50 to 100 years.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I mean, who knows?

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 You could be able to maybe clone these people and say that.

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 He's not a science fiction author.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But he goes, "Advances in DNA technology you'll be able to do so much more.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So we don't want to dig these bodies up anymore.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Good day, sir."

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And they left.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So that's the official answer.

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And Spiracy caps for a second.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So they find the bodies in 1982.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They're digging them up in 1983 and 1984.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 They exhum half of the bog and then they find something else.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Something that puzzles the scientists.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Something that rattles the scientists.

262
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 They're looking at it.

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 They cannot place what they're looking at in history.

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 The scientists get together and they go, "You know what?

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 The world's not ready for this.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 We can't exhum any more of these bodies."

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 "What excuse will you give them, boss?"

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 "Well, we'll make up something about DNA and no one will touch the other half of the bog for 50 or 100 years.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Maybe then the world will be ready for what's lying in the bog of Brevard County."

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 That was a weird story.

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And like I said, I had to read three articles and it was just an offhand comment at the end.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They go, "Yeah, they just stopped half of it still there."

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I was like, "What?"

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I was like, "That is interesting. Why would you stop?"

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That'd be like someone finding a triceratops and they dust off two of the horns and they're like,

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 "Okay, I'm sure there's another horn in there, but I'm sure a scientist is 50 years from now."

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Since when did scientists wanted to share stuff?

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Dude, they always wanted to get those Nobel Prizes and that $500,000 of geek money.

279
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Hoshi, calling that carbon helicopter, we are headed out to Bracknell, England.

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And as we're flying out to Bracknell, we notice Hoshi is not really looking where he's going.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 He's just kind of moving his head all along.

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 The helicopter, he's able to keep it steady, but he's looking all along.

283
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We're like, "Hoshi, what's going on?"

284
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And he turns and he's wearing lead sunglasses.

285
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Now, our first thought is, should we?

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Should we have those?

287
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 But then we quickly realized he's making a joke.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Take him off, dude, so you can actually see where you're going.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 He's making a joke about the lead mask case.

290
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, I'm going to go over this real quick, because I think a lot of you guys know it.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 It's a very, very famous weird mystery.

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Back in August 20th, 1966 in Brazil, two men are found dead.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 They're wearing formal wear and they're wearing lead masks.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's funny. I always thought they were wearing like the man in the iron mask,

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 like full on giant helmet.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Now, apparently they just had metal sunglasses on.

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And they're both dead. They're just laying there.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Some kids found them. They're flying kites or something like that.

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 That's going to ruin your day.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 The kids keep flying their kite. They're like, "Oh, they went so good this day.

301
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Those bodies aren't going anywhere."

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 After a couple of hours when they get the cops, the cops find the bodies

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and they find a note lying between them.

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And it says 1630, meaning time, 1630 be of the specific location.

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 1830, in jest capsules.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 After the effect, protect metals, await signal mask.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So whatever that means. I mean, I guess you can kind of put it together.

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 It's also possible that I copied and pasted it wrong.

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 But you guys get the point, whether or not I copied and pasted it wrong.

310
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We don't know how they died. What happened was they were taken to the corner

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 and the corner was like, this is not a joke.

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The corner was super busy that week.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So we didn't get around to figuring out why these two people dressed in formal wear,

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 wearing lead sunglasses and mysteriously died.

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And by the time he was like, "Oh yeah, I forgot. I gotta go do that thing.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I gotta go solve that mystery. I gotta go do my job."

317
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 The organs were decayed so much they couldn't figure it out.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 The main believable theory is they poisoned themselves, but why?

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And then you have questions of, was this some sort of colt activity?

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Were they tricked into killing themselves?

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Were they part of some UFO colt?

322
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 A lot of those stories get pulled up from time to time.

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 There was a friend of the dudes who said that they were scientific spiritualists

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 and they believed by ingesting a massive amount of drugs they could pierce the veil

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 they could see the other side.

326
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The idea was that the image was going to be so blinding that they had to wear lead sunglasses.

327
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It kind of defeats the purpose to summon an ancient being and you can't see it.

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's just some little wimpy ghost.

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 He's like, "Yeah, I got eight arms and if you look at me, you'll turn to dust."

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, who's down for pancakes?

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 What? Should I take my mask off and see if this isn't like an imp?

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 No, no, no, dude, he said we turned to dust.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Hehehehehe, more pancakes for me.

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Anyways, normally when it's telling on Dead Rav Radio, you guys have all heard that story.

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But what I found with the help of a few others is a story even more bizarre.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 How she landed this carbonicopter were in Bracknell, England.

337
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I gotta give a shout out to two Reddit users, KeepItCosmic and SwanRonson2018.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I have never heard of this story before.

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Both of them, we're posting it online and it's crazy.

340
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Keep that lead mask story in mind because we're going to kind of go down the same path.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 So who should go ahead and land us here at this little house in Bracknell, England?

342
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's January 15th, 2020.

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 This just happened. This mystery is just beginning.

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 These workers need to do some repairs at this house.

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Oi mate, let us in. We gotta repair some stuff.

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 No answer.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 No answer. So eventually they go out and they get the landlord.

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 The landlord is the one who sent them there to do the repairs in the first place.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So imagine this house looks pretty shabby from the outside.

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And so the landlord comes down, actually brings the police with them.

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The people living at this house weren't in the best of health.

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 You had June Corfield. She was 80 years old.

353
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And then Steven Corfield, her 60-year-old son who had been blind his entire life.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 So when someone's not answering the door, just in general,

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 they're not home or they're taking a nap.

356
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But when they're super old, you're going to bring the cops with you, right?

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 They bring in a locksmith as well. It's a whole party down here.

358
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It's a block party at this point.

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Open the door and the first thing they see is kind of what everyone expected.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Two bodies.

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 They're unfortunate, but that's kind of what they thought.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 They're both sitting in two separate chairs, mother and son facing each other.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Steven is wearing a shirt, shoes and socks, and his pants are down around his ankles.

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I mean, fine, you can dress like that.

365
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 You might not want to dress like that in front of your mom, especially in front of your dead mom,

366
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 but he's dressed like that.

367
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So when they're processing the crime scene, they find in Steven's pocket,

368
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 and they found a thousand pounds in his pocket.

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So the cops are like, "Hey, look it, I found 900 pounds in his pocket."

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 June, the mother, she didn't have any pants on.

371
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 At least Steven had the politeness to wear him around his ankles, even though they don't do any job.

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 She has no pants on whatsoever.

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 All she has on is a shirt and one sock.

374
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 These two bodies are just sitting across from each other.

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And the cops are looking at each other and they're realizing very quickly they're in a really, really spooky house.

376
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 There was two bedrooms in the house, as you would expect.

377
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 A mother and a son have two bedrooms, but only one bed.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And it was a double.

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 The cops are like, "You can process this room."

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "No, no, no, you process it."

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Locking them inside until he gets all the evidence.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So you have to assume the mother and the son were the very least sleeping in the same bed.

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 The fact that they were partially clothed makes you think other things.

384
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But that's not even the weirdest part of this story.

385
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 The other bedroom had a refrigerator in it.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Oh, it's like a man cave. Keep a couple of Budweiser's in there.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It was unplugged.

388
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 The refrigerator was moved out of the kitchen and put in the quote-unquote "spare bedroom."

389
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 They could have used it. They could have had two beds.

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Also in that room were three unplugged television sets.

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Just sitting there.

392
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 As the police are moving through this house, they realize there's no light.

393
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And not in the sense that someone's flicking the switch and there's no electricity.

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Every single light bulb had been removed from its socket.

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And every single device in the house that could be plugged in was unplugged.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Someone had even gone so far to shut off the fuse box.

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Even though the house had access to electricity, it was completely cut off from the grid.

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 They had no heater, nothing to cook with.

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 They had no toilet paper anywhere in the house.

400
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Just two bodies.

401
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 A bunch of electronics kind of scattered around the house, all unplugged.

402
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Every single light bulb missing from the socket.

403
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 The police are trying to figure stuff out.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And the first thing they think of is murder suicide.

405
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 One of them must have killed the other one and then killed themselves.

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 They start doing autopsies and everything like that.

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It looks like she died of pneumonia and coronary heart disease.

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 There is no clue as to why Stephen died. None.

409
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 They said when they were doing the autopsy they found a small tumor in his head,

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 but the coroner goes, "This is not what killed him."

411
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Like, yeah, he wasn't going to have a fun next couple of years.

412
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But this is not what killed him.

413
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 We have no idea how he died.

414
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 They found a newspaper in the living room that was dated December 19th or sometime in December,

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 so they believe that people were still alive at that time.

416
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But they were never even able to accurately tell how long those bodies had been dead.

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 The theory they started to develop was he was blind, he needed his mom for everything,

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 and his mom died, so he just kind of sat there until he died.

419
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 That's really the theory they're going with now.

420
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 I also find the fact that even if someone, especially someone who's been blind since birth,

421
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 that they're that disabled, that's a little insulting.

422
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I actually have a friend who's blind.

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 She's legally blind. She's not completely blind, but she can't drive a car and she needs a little stick.

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 She has one of those, so she can take her.

425
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So if she lifts weights, I would find it odd to think someone who is 6 years old and blind the whole time

426
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 would just sit there and die and be like, "Well, I guess my mom said I'm just going to sit here until I start smelling like her."

427
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I find that kind of insulting.

428
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 He could have at the very least known where the door is and walked out and just been like, "Hey guys, help me."

429
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I don't know how funny it might have lived in the middle of the forest,

430
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 but still, I know much of Cartoon Foxes show up and they nitch you a sweater and then they lead you to help.

431
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Find that a little insulting that he could just not see so much that he died.

432
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I mean, that's basically what they're saying.

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 There's two big puzzling elements on top of everything else with all of these light bulbs being removed.

434
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 In the kitchen, they found 10 cartons of long-life milk, which I don't even know existed.

435
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It actually can last for six months. There's a different way to pasteurize it.

436
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It's milk with a shelf life of six months.

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 They found 10 cartons of long-life milk and 10 chocolate cakes sitting in the kitchen.

438
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 So it didn't starve to death.

439
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And that's such a bizarre number to have too.

440
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 That's a little excessive, right?

441
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I mean, I wish I had 10 chocolate cakes, but it's just weird.

442
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I mean, if you have two or three, how many chocolate cakes do you have at your house?

443
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 How many chocolate cakes have you had at your house at any given time?

444
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Now, I don't think they were like made from cake boss.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I don't think they were actually giant like Duncan Hines cakes.

446
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But still, I don't also think they were cupcakes.

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Somewhere between a cupcake and a wedding cake. That's what they had 10 of.

448
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 So that's kind of a weird detail.

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And then you have this going back to the lead mass case.

450
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 These two bodies are sitting in this house with 10 chocolate cakes.

451
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Like I found nine chocolate cakes, Captain. You got all these chocolate cakes.

452
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You got all this milk. You got everything unplugged.

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You have all the light bulbs removed. You have the circuit breaker thrown.

454
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And in between these two bodies is a note.

455
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 One investigator said it wasn't written like a note, like a suicide note or anything like that.

456
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It was almost like a list.

457
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 They wrote a bunch of stuff out, crossed some of it out.

458
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And the things they made out was digital radio bush.

459
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I'm like what? I'll save that for my band name later.

460
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And they had a phrase that said "China Dab".

461
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Now the police believe that that part of the message related to in between both of these corpses,

462
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 they each had a bush dab radio.

463
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Each of them also had a bottle of water at their feet.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Hers was empty. Stephen still had a little bit of liquid in it, which they tested.

465
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It wasn't a toxin.

466
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So they think the phrase digital radio bush in China Dab is in relation to that.

467
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 These are just FM radios. They're not any sort of communication device.

468
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 They are, but they're just one-way communication devices.

469
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 But could it have been a shopping list saying hey let's go get these things?

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Let's go buy these two radios?

471
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But also on the list was this.

472
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Check water, check electric, and put memo at the top of stairs.

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Do not come in.

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Why would you put a note at the top of the stairs saying do not come in?

475
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 By that point you're already in the house.

476
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Is it possible that they wanted to die? This is gross, but is it possible they wanted to die in bed together

477
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 and just let their body slowly rot away and like flies and worms and stuff are showing up?

478
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And they didn't want anyone to bug the bodies possibly?

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 It's just another layer of the puzzle. What does that note mean?

480
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 We can understand when people say check water, check electric, maybe they're going to go on a trip.

481
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They want to have that stuff shut off so you know, a bunch of burglars don't break in and turn on all your water faucets.

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's possible that they had planned to die and they figured if we shut off the water and we shut off the electric

483
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 a lot of times bodies are found because unpaid bills.

484
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Your electric's going on for a while, people show up at your house.

485
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They show up at your house with a big old buff scientist from the last story that like oh yeah, we've got a new job

486
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 beating up old people for electric money.

487
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 You would think that the note do not come in would be outside the house though.

488
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Just let us rot in peace. Or IP.

489
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

490
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 You could also say this is a list of some sort of ritual which we've covered a couple times on this show.

491
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Preparation for something.

492
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Even if they were planning on dying peacefully in bed, why would they go through the trouble of unplugging and moving the fridge?

493
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Removing all the electronics, carrying the TVs.

494
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Now they think about it, how does an 80 year old woman and a blind guy carry three television sets in a fridge?

495
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 How does that work?

496
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Now that's even more puzzling.

497
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Not saying blind people can't carry television sets.

498
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Even if he's not blind, even a six year old man's going to have a hard time moving a fridge.

499
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 This is my take on it. This is my conspiracy cap take on it.

500
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 They were doing some sort of ritual.

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 They were trying to invoke something.

502
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And to do this ritual they needed to fulfill a couple things.

503
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Which isn't unheard of in rituals.

504
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You have no electricity in your area, because that can interfere with the spirits.

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Water.

506
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Running water can interfere with spirits.

507
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Maybe they were so desperate to find some way out of their current situation.

508
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 That they turned to the dark arts.

509
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And in the course of trying to touch just a piece of this wicked force in the world.

510
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 A mother and her son did the unthinkable.

511
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That was part of the ritual.

512
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 They were making that list to prepare that ritual.

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And the final rule of it was, do not enter the upstairs.

514
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 That will be the domain of what you have summoned.

515
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But it went wrong. It went terribly wrong.

516
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And a demonic attack won't show up on any sort of medical results.

517
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 As she was sitting there being attacked by this creature that they attempted to control.

518
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It took her life, but to a coroner it looked like natural causes.

519
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And the son sat there alone in this house.

520
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 He could have gotten up. He could have gotten help.

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 But every time he tried to move, something held him in that chair.

522
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 He was forced to sit there until he died.

523
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 By the time the police showed up, it was just two bodies slowly decaying in a house.

524
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 There would be no proof of any of this, this story that I just made up.

525
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 There would be no proof of any of that.

526
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 They would just come in and see this and try to analyze the crime scene as best as they could.

527
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 A house full of nothing.

528
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 A house that was devoid of almost any proof anyone had ever lived there.

529
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 A house with no toilet paper in it.

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But ten cartons of milk and ten chocolate cakes.

531
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And it may be one of those mysteries that you shouldn't investigate.

532
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 One of those mysteries you shouldn't want to solve.

533
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 It may take you down roads that lead you to dark thoughts and dark actions.

534
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 If you let this story infest in your brain, you may be wondering day and night,

535
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 what could have happened to them?

536
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Until the point that you are so obsessed with this case, you want to find the ritual they may have performed.

537
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It's a lot of fun being a paranormal investigator.

538
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But when you find yourself furiously unscrewing light bulbs and scribbling a note at 4 a.m.

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 before patiently sitting in a chair, it stops being fun.

540
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You've gone from being a paranormal investigator to just another story that we'll cover on Dead Rabbit Radio.

541
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
