1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Did Benjamin Franklin's ghost try to build a new god?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at the World War II mystery, the ghost blimp of San Francisco.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,400
 Hundreds of witnesses watched the event, but to this day the military still cannot explain what happened today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,900
 [Music]

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,800
 Hey everyone, that was kind of formal. Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,300
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,700
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,200
 So for this first story we're gonna go way back in time to the magical era of the mid-1800s.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,200
 Everyone's favorite era and it's funny because the mid-1800s had this weird combination of like,

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,500
 people still were super superstitious, but they also had civilization budding up against everything.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,100
 Mechanization, technology, all of that stuff.

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,000
 It really was kind of the maker breakpoint for humanity and belief systems.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,300
 So we're going back to the mid-1800s.

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,700
 [Making sounds]

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,300
 That's us walking in a time warp.

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,200
 [Swoosh]

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,100
 And you go, "Jason, what state are we in?" And I go, "I don't know. I didn't put that in my notes."

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,400
 But so we're somewhere in the United States, most likely the East Coast.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,800
 So anyway, we're standing there in a field, apparently, couple houses.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,700
 A dude comes out and he's like, "Hey guys, what are you doing here?"

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,900
 And we're like, "That's, that's, you're standing quite like the modern man."

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, you know whatever. My name's John Murray Spear."

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
 And we're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool. You're not a serial killer, are you?

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,300
 Because you're using your middle name." And he's like, "That's a serial killer. Oh, never mind."

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,500
 So, John Murray Spear was a minister turned spiritualist.

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,200
 Now, as a minister, he actually, you gotta give him credit because he put his money where his mouth is,

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,500
 or was, because he's dead now, but he believed he was anti-slavery.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,600
 So that's a good belief to have.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,500
 But one day when he was preaching that at a church, his parishioners didn't agree with him

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,600
 and they beat him down to basically to the point of being an invalid for like two weeks.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,400
 But it didn't deter him. He's like, "I know what's right. I'm gonna do what's right."

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,000
 And to be fair, we were not put, our time traveling mission was after the slavery beating.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,100
 We weren't present for that. We wouldn't have done something to help him.

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,600
 But post-slavery beating were back in time.

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,200
 Now, in this time period, spiritualism was starting to take off.

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,600
 And that was kind of this weird, that was kind of this weird point in American history

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,400
 where talking to the dead became the big fad.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,700
 It started off with these two sisters. I think they were the Fox sisters.

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,200
 Out on the East Coast, they said that they could communicate with the spirits by knocking.

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,100
 And it became, and it's funny, it was really the start of the boob hill.

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
 I've talked about that on past episodes.

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,400
 You want to get a woman's attention, tell her you're into ghosts in the supernatural

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
 because all women like that stuff.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,800
 The girls said they could communicate to the dead through this knocking thing.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,000
 And it became like high society where they're like, "If you're hosting a party,

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
 why don't you have like a ghost party?"

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
 Like everyone was doing this stuff. It was super, super popular.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
 And John Murray Spear was like, "Yeah, I'm a Christian minister and all that stuff,

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
 but this sounds like more up my alley."

50
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 Like I really want to get on this ghost talking to train.

51
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,500
 So in 1853, that was the MX.

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,300
 Now it's 1853 and John Murray Spear is completely on board with this spiritualism stuff.

53
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,100
 It would have been awesome to go back in time to go to like some old, timey, fancy dinner party.

54
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,800
 And halfway through it, the hostess comes out and she's like,

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
 "Hey, we're just going to knock on stuff for the next 20 minutes.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,100
 We're going to turn all the... Do they have lights back then?

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,700
 We're going to snuff all the candles and we're just going to knock on tables for a while."

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,500
 I can just imagine a bunch of rich people sitting around having nothing better to do

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,100
 than to have the candles snuffed out knocking on stuff.

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,700
 John Murray Spear aside for a second, if I was back in time and I was invited to one of these fancy dinner parties

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,100
 where rich people try talking to ghosts, I would most likely start mucking about.

62
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,700
 I don't fake ghost stuff. I have some part of my rule.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
 But again, you couldn't...

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,600
 Could you resist if you're hanging out with Mrs. Hoitenthoit and she has her...

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
 You know, all of her forks are special. Like, here's your seashell fork.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Here's your lettuce fork. That's a tomato fork. All that stuff.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,300
 You would just be too tempted to start messing with stuff.

68
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,100
 If she's trying to talk to a ghost, she'd be knocking on the wall.

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,200
 I'd be lighting little fires. I mean, I'm not a... I'm not a...

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,700
 Like pyromaniac. I'd basically be Dennis the Menace of the 1800s.

71
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,100
 It's specifically only spiritual events for the rich.

72
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,500
 I guess that's kind of a limited Dennis the Menace-esque genre.

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,100
 But that's what I would do. I couldn't help myself.

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,000
 If I was hanging out with a bunch of street urchins and they're like,

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,300
 "I want to know if me mom still loves me. Can we knock? Can we knock to see if my mom is still around?"

76
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
 I'd be like, "Yeah, a little street urchin." And dust them off a bit.

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,300
 Yeah, let's see if we can legitimately contact your mom.

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,700
 But if I was at a fancy dinner party and they're like, "We want to know who is the best dressed here."

79
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
 I would totally be like knocking for that hot chick.

80
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,700
 Plus, again, I'm just going to be hitting on chicks in the dark all the time.

81
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,500
 Because again, the boob hill, every girl there is going to be totally turned on.

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,400
 I... okay.

83
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,200
 Despite my Dennis the Menace-slash-predator-esque behavior at these dinner parties,

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
 I'm just trying to set the tone.

85
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,800
 So this is the era John Murray Spear lived in.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 Minus me and my horrible, horrible instincts.

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,900
 But it was in vogue. Everyone was doing this stuff.

88
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,300
 And John Murray Spear jumps fully on board.

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,500
 But his intentions were far more grandiose than impressing people at a dinner party.

90
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,400
 No, he thought that he could actually talk to the greatest minds of the past.

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,100
 Which is a noble goal. Which is a noble goal. I'll give him that.

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,600
 So what happens is, he's like, "I'm going to try to contact the smarty pants of the past."

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,500
 And he does. According to him, he does.

94
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,300
 "When not only does he find the people in the past are more than willing to help us in the present,

95
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,500
 or his present, our future, wait, his future, our past, his future, wait.

96
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,800
 His present, our past."

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,900
 This is what I'm talking about.

98
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,500
 So, not only were they willing to help the people of his present,

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,400
 present of our past, but whatever, these dudes are going to help.

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,600
 So he contacts this group and they just, these ghosts, these ghosts show up and they're like,

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,400
 "Waring?" And they're all like, blue outlines and stuff. I don't know.

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,100
 They didn't have color back then. Everything was in black and white.

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:01,300
 And Benjamin Franklin pops through this portal and he goes, "John Murray's spare, I am Benjamin Franklin."

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,300
 And of course you'd be like, "You're obviously Benjamin Franklin. You're holding a kite."

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
 And he's like, "Yes, this is my ghost kite."

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,500
 And I am the leader of a group called the Association of Electric Sizers.

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,200
 And you're like, "Whoa, okay. What's that?" He's like, "We are the ghosts who try to make electricity,

108
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,600
 not like, shoot it out of our hands, like the emperor from Return of the Jedi."

109
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,500
 And John Murray's spare is like, "What's that?" And he's like, "Don't worry.

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
 You'll know when you die and you live in the future too."

111
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,600
 He goes, "We want to bring humanity to a higher level.

112
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,500
 We're here to give you ideas for technology."

113
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 John Murray's spare is like, "That's great. So there's like an association. Who else is with you?"

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 And Benjamin Franklin goes, "What about my friend Thomas Jefferson?"

115
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,700
 [imitates sound]

116
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,500
 Peers out of the portal. "Whoa, Thomas Jefferson! I know you. You just died like 20 years ago because we're in the past."

117
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,300
 Thomas Jefferson's like, "Yep."

118
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,300
 And then Benjamin Franklin goes, "Also we have John Quincy Adams."

119
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500
 [imitates sound]

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,600
 And John Murray's spare would be like, "What does John Quincy Adams have to do with electricity?"

121
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,900
 "Yeah, just forget about it."

122
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,500
 Then we have Benjamin Rush.

123
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 John Murray's spare is like, "Who the hell's that?"

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 You got Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and Benjamin Rush.

125
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 I had to look up Benjamin Rush.

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 He was the guy who signed the Declaration of Independence.

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 There was a bunch of people who signed the Declaration of Independence.

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 As far as I could tell, still nothing to do with electricity.

129
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 And then the last guy to jump out of the portal was John Murray.

130
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 The person John Murray's spare is named after.

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 A little egotistical.

132
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 And he was a minister.

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 Again, nothing to do with electricity.

134
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 John Murray's spare is a little underwhelming as the list goes down the line.

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 John Murray's spare is like, "Oh, hey, your name's John Murray. That's cool to know."

136
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 The electricizers also had other groups.

137
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 One of the groups was...

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 So here's your choices.

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 You can summon the ghosts of the dead, the greatest minds possible.

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 You can get a badass group named the electricizers.

141
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 You can get the elementizers.

142
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 It's pretty cool.

143
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 Teach me stuff about elements.

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 Teach me stuff about, you know, like gold and maybe a little alchemy.

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 You're like, "Okay, what else?"

146
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 Summon up.

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 You get the governmentizers.

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 It's kind of boring.

149
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 They just show up and lecture you.

150
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
 It's like civics class, but taught by ghosts.

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 And at that class, I could see John Quincy Adams or like...

152
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 Abraham Lincoln wasn't dead yet, so he wouldn't be a part of any of these groups.

153
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 But you can get some people.

154
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 But if, like, let's say even the ghosts knew you were totally lame, they're like,

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 "Oh, man, I don't want to talk to this guy.

156
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
 Just send him to one of these two groups.

157
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 These two groups are completely useless.

158
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 They're a bunch of ghosts nobody hangs out with."

159
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 You could summon up the healthfulizers.

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 They just teach you about health.

161
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 Pro tip.

162
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 You shouldn't get tips about living healthy from dead people.

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 Like, if you're already a ghost, you probably don't know about how to live a healthy life.

164
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 Just a little tip.

165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 And then the other one was the agriculturalizers.

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 They just teach you how stuff grows.

167
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 Like, I'm sure back then that was far more important,

168
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 because I'm not growing wheat, and back then everyone was growing wheat,

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 so you may actually want to talk to a ghost of like Johnny Appleseed or something.

170
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 I don't even think he was dead at this point, but you know what I mean?

171
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 Like, it just, it's, I would be, I would be so upset if I finally was able to summon a cadre of the dead.

172
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 And they're like, "Let us teach you about how nitrogen and soil."

173
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 I'll be like, "God damn it, dude."

174
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 Anyways, so, back to the electricizers though, because those are the important ones.

175
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 They tell John Murray Spear, "Listen, you're on a mission.

176
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 We are here. We're going to teach humanity the power of technology."

177
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 And more than that, you are going to build, no, you, John Murray Spear,

178
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 are going to give birth to the new God that will usher mankind into utopia.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 So, the electricizers gave him the plans, and I'm doing air quotes around that,

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 for a device known as the new motive power.

181
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 And the reason why I say plans and air quotes is because each session,

182
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 he would basically get the vision for a different piece and have to assemble it as he went along.

183
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 It was super intuitive.

184
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 He would basically go into these trances and talk to these people.

185
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 Now, it should be fully noted right now that the fact that he was actually talking to Benjamin Franklin and this group,

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 he probably wasn't.

187
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 He probably was either making it up or imagining it.

188
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,500
 It's possible he was talking to a ghost, but the thing is, is that the fact that one of the ghosts was the person

189
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 he was named after is a little delusional.

190
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 The fact that he was the one chosen to create this thing called the new motive power,

191
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 it was also known as, this is the list, this was the marketing list,

192
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 the new motive power, the physical savior, heaven's last gift to man, new creation,

193
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:00,500
 great spiritual revelation of the age, philosopher's stone, art of all arts, science of all sciences, the new Messiah.

194
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 I mean, most people talk to Charlie Charlie on a piece of paper and a pencil.

195
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 This guy's believing that he's ushering in the last great age of man.

196
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 And so it probably was either a scam or a delusion of grandeur.

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 But he does go about trying to create the new motive power.

198
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 Now he doesn't have a ton of money, but they can create a small version of the model.

199
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 At this point he does get a smallish group of followers.

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 And so they build this model, they raise $2,000, and the full size adult model of the new motive power

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 is going to cost $20,000, but they figure, well, this is the baby size.

202
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 You have to give birth to a baby, then it grows to an adult.

203
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 Like this is basically the way that a human would develop.

204
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 So he's putting it together piece by piece, and people have, there's been a few disc...

205
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 No, there's no photographs of it.

206
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 No, I don't believe there's any drawings of it from the time period.

207
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 But it was basically like a giant mechanical device that sat on a desk, and it had like a pendulum in it,

208
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 and they plugged it all in, there's no plugs, but I mean, they hook it all up, and then they had this woman called the new Mary.

209
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 It was a full ritual.

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 They brought in this woman called the new Mary, and to this point nobody knows who that woman was.

211
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 But so they give the device all set up, and they're like, this is what...

212
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 You can see Benjamin Franklin in the background, like giving him a thumbs up, and John Murray Spears like, thank you, thank you.

213
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 And the woman then, the new Mary, laid in front of it, legs spread open, and simulated childbirth for hours.

214
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 She's like, "Ugh, brrrrrrr!"

215
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 "Ugh, uugh!"

216
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 And there's just this machine sitting in front of her, and Benjamin Franklin's ghost is like, yeah, keep pushing, baby.

217
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 Yeah, do it. Do it!

218
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 And John Murray Spears looking over at him, like, what's going on, Ben?

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 Anyway, so after two hours the woman gets up, and then she begins caressing it like you would a baby.

220
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 And there was a slight movement in the machine, and John Murray Spears is like, that's it.

221
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 It's been given life through this creation of both technology and this woman acting like a mom.

222
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 It's been given life. And then, just when mankind was on the cusp, the precipice of having its true God, its true mechanical God,

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 the art of all art, the science of all sciences, a mob rushed into the building and smashed it to bits.

224
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 Well, that's what John Murray Spears, the most likely explanation that historians say is that it did move a little bit,

225
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 and then some more time passed, a couple days, a couple weeks, and it was just a piece of metal and wood sitting on a desk.

226
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 And John Murray Spears realized that it just didn't work, and that it was all just kind of a waste of time and money,

227
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 and they locked it up in a closet or threw it into a swamp.

228
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 That's the most likely, there's been no proof that a mob destroyed the machine.

229
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 That was the story that was going around at the time, but there's actually no proof of that.

230
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 The only thing we know is that it was built and then it went missing.

231
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
 And before you go into the conspiracy thing, like maybe it's missing because it got big and started walking around the city.

232
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 No, John Murray Spears after that just became, he never really mentioned it again and just ended up becoming an author.

233
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
 Yeah, that's the story of the new mode of power. Quite anti-climatic, I know.

234
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 It would have been much more interesting if on the verge of life, the ignorant masses of America smashed it to bits.

235
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 We smashed it good with our clubs. But that's not what happened.

236
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 It just was a piece of junk that was put together poorly and John Murray Spears was probably just daydreaming the whole thing,

237
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 or he wasn't following the direction, giving the benefit of the doubt, he wasn't following the directions correctly, and it didn't work.

238
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 You know, it's really one of those things that if I was just hanging out and I started getting messages from ghosts,

239
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 Benjamin Franklin's ghost, Optimus Prime's ghost, whatever, and they started telling me to build something or to do something,

240
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 I wouldn't do it because, one, I think I was crazy.

241
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 And then, two, I think, well, you're a ghost, you do it.

242
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 If you're so powerful that you can float around and appear in my living room and transcend space and time, you do it.

243
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 I'm not gonna do it because if I do it, I'm gonna be a lunatic, I'm probably gonna be locked up or I'll be in the history books.

244
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,500
 I'll have a Wikipedia page about some stupid machine I built or I guess it works and I change humanity forever,

245
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 but you do it, man. You're the ghost. Go possess somebody. Go possess like a homeless person.

246
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 That's a little cold, but I don't know why they're more prone to possession.

247
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 Go possess somebody. Have them build it. I'm not building it.

248
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 I got a podcast to record, dude. What if a ghost told me to record this podcast and then I forgot?

249
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 Kind of weird. Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on to our next story.

250
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 Our next story, our last story, is the story of the ghost blimp.

251
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 I actually just found out about the ghost blimp a couple days ago.

252
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Really bizarre story. And when you first, it's a sensational title.

253
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 So you're like, oh, you know, they probably saw like a cloud on the sky and the navy was like, oh, what's that?

254
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 And then it disappeared and they're like, let's put that in history books forever for people to ponder.

255
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 This is legitimate mystery. To this day, they still don't know what happened.

256
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 So now we're in 1942. It's World War II. We're in San Francisco.

257
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 People are like, ah, Japanese may bomb us at any point.

258
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 They did attack the coast a couple times. They attacked down in LA.

259
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 Before the Battle of LA, the submarines were launching shells.

260
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 Japanese submarines were launching shells at an oil refinery.

261
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 We had a submarine appear off the coast up here in Portland.

262
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 So there was that threat. So it's August 16th, 1942.

263
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 And you got these two young men, they're blimp pilots.

264
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 You know what? Okay, you know what? It's funny because you think about this.

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 It's 1942. All the dudes are wearing their little uniforms and all the hot chicks and those dresses

266
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 that made them look super thin that kind of flared out.

267
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 You got that, I guess that's more like disco music, but you know what I mean?

268
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 You got that "In the Mood" song. That's okay, whatever.

269
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 It's not ragtime, but it's like that. It's like crappier jazz music playing all the time.

270
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 Big band, whatever. So you have these hot chicks, you have these young men and their uniforms,

271
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 and they're at a bar and the girls are like, "Ooh, look at them. Look at them.

272
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 Hot servicemen and the servicemen are like, "Yeah, we're in the Air Force."

273
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 And the girls are like, "Ooh, do you fly?" And they're like, "Yeah, we fly.

274
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 Me and my buddy here, we fly." They're like, "Ooh, can we go on a flight with you?"

275
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

276
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 The blimp, the blimp going 10 miles an hour over the city. The two women completely bored.

277
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 How? I get it. I get it.

278
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 I think most people join the military for one of two reasons.

279
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
 To serve their country or to pick up chicks. And those are both noble reasons.

280
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 But you join the Air Force, you want to fly a Mustang.

281
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,500
 You're blowing stuff up. Not a blimp.

282
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 Not the slowest air vehicle ever made.

283
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 The only thing slower than a blimp is a kite.

284
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 And to be fair, kites can make better turns. You're in a blimp.

285
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Like, yes, you're in the Air Force. You got a snazzy uniform.

286
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 [blows air]

287
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 This new model, we can travel at the speed of wind.

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 Oh my God, that's amazing. Will it hold up? Yeah, it'll hold up, gentlemen.

289
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 Just be careful where your seat belts.

290
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 So anyways, I like to say flying a blimp is better than nothing, but I don't know if that's true.

291
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 So these two dudes are flying around in a blimp in San Francisco.

292
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 And they see oil on the surface of the water out in the bay.

293
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 And they go, "That might be a sub. That might actually be a Japanese sub hiding under water."

294
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,500
 Now apparently that happened back then. For whatever reason, subs would either have to leak oil out,

295
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 or would sometimes accidentally leak oil out. It wasn't too for sure on the research.

296
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 It seems like that kind of defeats the purpose of being underwater if oil shoots to the surface.

297
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 But anyways, so this blimp goes over the oil. And there was multiple witnesses to this.

298
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 Two men are on the blimp. It's a crew of two.

299
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 And they radio in a headquarters, "Hey, we see oil on the water. We're going to go see if there's a sub down there."

300
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 So the blimp... [blows air]

301
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 Goes out there, and they're talking. They're like, "Man, I wonder why those girls...

302
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 I wonder why those girls left so quickly last night." They're like, "I don't know. They're on the blimp. It's totally awesome."

303
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 We flew around San Francisco and it only took three days to get from one end to the other.

304
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 But anyways, so it lowers itself to 30 feet above the water. So that's super, super close.

305
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 Now there was a navy ship out in the bay, and there was a fishing boat in the bay.

306
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 And the people on the navy ship were looking because they're thinking they might be a sub there,

307
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 and we have to be ready for something. The witnesses on the fishing boat,

308
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 one of them broke out their binoculars and was watching the whole event just because it's a sightseeing.

309
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 This is a military blimp, and you see it hovering over a point near you,

310
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 and then it goes to 30 feet above the water. And the guy's watching with the binoculars,

311
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 so people are watching from the ship. And then the blimp throws out ballast, which allows it to rise again,

312
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 and it flies away. People are like, "Oh, okay." They just saw it lower, sit there for a while,

313
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 and then drop the ballast and fly up. So a short time later, the blimp floats by the water,

314
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 floats by the Golden Gate Bridge. And again, hundreds of witnesses.

315
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 You've got people driving down the road, you've got people in the city,

316
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 you've got people on the other side of the bridge in Marin County watching this blimp fly by.

317
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 It then raises itself to 2,000 feet, which is actually getting dangerously high for a blimp.

318
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 And it should have kicked in a safety mechanism to start to lower it.

319
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Now, obviously, a normal person isn't going to be like, "Whoa, look at how high that is.

320
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,500
 That's actually quite dangerous." But when people were describing the event to the Navy later on,

321
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 they were saying how high it was, and the Navy officers would be like, "Hmm, that's kind of weird.

322
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 It shouldn't go that high." And at this point, it started to look bent or damaged.

323
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 The blimp didn't look normal. It wasn't a big ole inflated blimp.

324
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,500
 It just started to -- people started to notice some deformation in the blimp itself.

325
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,500
 But it's still just kind of flying by. Now, people at this point, you know, again, it's a sight.

326
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 People are used to seeing stuff like that in the area, but it's still weird,

327
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 because this blimp is kind of flying in areas where it normally wouldn't.

328
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 People are breaking out of the binoculars. There are people in the blimp, in the cabin.

329
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,500
 It's flying by. Three hours later, it comes by this beach in San Francisco.

330
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 It's way off course of where it should be at this point.

331
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 And it hasn't had any radio contact since it said, "We think there's a submarine underwater."

332
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 We're investigating this oil spill. Complete radio silence.

333
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 Blimp's flying by. Now, it comes down. And people are just sitting on the beach chilling.

334
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 It crashes into the beach, and at that point, a bunch of stuff is knocked off,

335
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 one of them being a depth charge, which they used to drop on some Marines.

336
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 It's knocked off the blimp and rolls into the beach, and enough weight is knocked off the blimp

337
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 that it actually gets airborne again and starts flying into the city.

338
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 Now, at this point, everyone's freaking out. There's basically a live bomb on the beach.

339
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 There's this blimp flying dangerously closer to the city.

340
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 People are making phone calls on their old timey phones, saying,

341
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 "Hey, there's something really bad's going on with this blimp."

342
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 It begins then basically crashing into buildings and then finally smashing into the ground.

343
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 The entire blimp...

344
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 [blimp noises]

345
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 deflates. Actually made that noise, I'm assuming. And it just sat there.

346
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 Now, at this point, the rescue crews go out to the blimp.

347
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 Now, I don't know what they filled blimps with back then.

348
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 I don't even know what they filled blimps with now.

349
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 But of course, I'm sure they were afraid of fires or really bad smells or whatever.

350
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 So the firemen get out there, the police officers get out there,

351
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 and they're like, "Clear the area, clear the area. We have to save the crew."

352
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 They go and the cabin door of the blimp is open, and it's completely empty.

353
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 Everyone scratches their head at the same time.

354
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 [blimp noises]

355
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 So, obviously, the military had investigated this.

356
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 And one of the theories was...

357
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 One of the theories of the, like, media.

358
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 One of the...

359
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 I was reading an article the other day, and they're like,

360
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 "This man answered the riddle of the ghost blimp with one sentence."

361
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 And it was on, like, HuffPo or BuzzFeed or some other website.

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 And it was like...

363
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 The guy posted on Reddit about the mystery of the ghost blimp,

364
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 I think they fell out.

365
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 And the article was like, "See? How easy it's to solve this."

366
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 But see, so that was kind of the media's attitude towards it.

367
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 That it must have just been either they both fell out or one guy fell out and that was it.

368
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 But the military, to this day, have never really been able to figure out what happened.

369
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 Because this is the thing.

370
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 The safety bar to the door that leads outside and to your plummeting death, if you're in the air,

371
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 was unlatched and the door was open.

372
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,500
 Two of the three life jackets were missing, but it was required for you, if you were in a blimp,

373
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 to wear a life jacket, just in case.

374
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 Again, hard to pick up chicks when you're flying around in a blimp going 10 miles an hour

375
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 and you're wearing a giant life vest.

376
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 But so you'd think, well, maybe they fell out.

377
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 Maybe they were wearing their life vests, the door pops open, they fall out.

378
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 But there was other interesting clues.

379
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 One of them, their hat was sitting on the control panel.

380
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 So you think that if the thing shifted too much, everything in the place would have shifted.

381
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 So if it shifted and knocked them both out, why would the hat be sitting there?

382
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 Two, nobody saw the people with binoculars who saw it hover over the water, over the oil.

383
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 Nobody saw anyone fall out of it.

384
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 It raised the ballast and floated away.

385
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 When it was flying by the Golden Gate Bridge, people said there were people in it.

386
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 So if they fell out, it happened sometime between after the Golden Gate Bridge

387
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 and before it crashed into the beach.

388
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 But what would have caused them to fall out of it?

389
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
 If they had bailed out, they could have radioed in.

390
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 Like if one of the theories was that one guy jumped out and the other guy jumped out to save him

391
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 but didn't radio it in.

392
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 And I get it, sometimes people make dumb decisions, but that's pretty stupid.

393
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 A guy falls out of the blimp and you go, "I'll save you!" and you jump out of the blimp too.

394
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 One of the theories is that they were captured by the Japanese,

395
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
 but that doesn't make sense because nobody saw that either.

396
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 The official military report says, "No fire, no submersion, no misconduct, and no missile struck the L-8,"

397
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 which was the designation of the blimp.

398
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 The careful analysis of the evidence indicates no reason for voluntary abandonment of the airship.

399
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,500
 The board therefore believes the abandonment was involuntary.

400
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 Maybe they fell out, maybe they were taken out, maybe they were abducted by aliens,

401
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 or maybe they simply just disappeared.

402
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 Them falling out, nobody witnessed that.

403
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 Them being captured by the Japanese, they had a briefcase of secret codes in the blimp that was still there.

404
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 So if they were abducted, it's most likely that that briefcase would go missing.

405
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 Them being abducted by aliens as fanciful as that is and completely against...

406
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 Occam's razor is that one fell out and the other one jumped, but they both fell out at the same time.

407
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,500
 But you think that that is something that the military could have said, this was an accident we think they fell out.

408
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 Because to this day they still say 100% unknown, undetermined.

409
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 They don't know what happened.

410
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 Alien abduction, they just disappeared.

411
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 Like, "Nyeeeww."

412
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 I don't know, I don't know.

413
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,500
 It's still, again, if it was something that it was flying through the fog and then it came out of the fog

414
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 and people were falling out of it, then you say, "Yeah, they fell out of it."

415
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 But there were so many witnesses watching it for so long and nobody saw anything fall out of it

416
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 and people saw people in it even after the Japanese submarine part.

417
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
 It really makes you think, where did these guys go?

418
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 Time portal?

419
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 Shifted to another reality?

420
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
 Alien abduction?

421
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 Yes, they're all fantastical explanations.

422
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 But when you run out of, they fell out.

423
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
 When even the military is not taking that as an answer.

424
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 And saying, you know, it was a horrible accident, we're retraining our people on how to deal with this stuff,

425
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 we're reinforcing the doors or anything like that.

426
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 They're just like, "We don't know what it is."

427
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 Because obviously if stuff mechanically fails, the military doesn't want that to keep happening.

428
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 If they go, "Hey, we think these guys fell out, so we're gonna reconfigure all of our blimps."

429
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 So to prevent that from ever happening again.

430
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 But they're like, "We don't know."

431
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 What happened to the crew of the ghost blimp?

432
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 To be fair, it wasn't called the ghost blimp when it was flying around.

433
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
 I wouldn't get on that blimp.

434
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 But interestingly enough, that blimp actually ended up becoming a Goodyear blimp

435
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500
 and flew in service for another 30 years with no other major accident.

436
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 So who knows?

437
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 Interesting story.

438
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 I always like it when I kind of stumble across something new I've never heard of,

439
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 and it just instantly intrigues me.

440
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 So that's it.

441
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 That is the story of L8 and the ghost blimp.

442
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,500
 So let's read this down actually like a conspiracy theory,

443
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 because I've had to read a ton of articles like this lately.

444
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 The blimp was called L8, which technically is late,

445
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 as in late to live longer.

446
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 Or L8, as in the L stands for life, and the 8 stands for 8,

447
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 like it's the life eater, possibly?

448
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 No, none of that works, does it?

449
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 I gotta stop reading all the--

450
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 We've got an episode coming up where it's all nonsense like that,

451
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 where each number means something.

452
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 I've been reading it too much.

453
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 So a quick little thing here.

454
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 I was editing the episode.

455
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 I have a really sensitive mic.

456
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 I'm using a Neumann TLM 103, and it's a condenser mic.

457
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 It picks up a lot of stuff.

458
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 Now there have been times in the past where I've been recording episodes,

459
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 and it's picked up weird noises.

460
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 And for the mo-- I'd say every single time when I'm editing it,

461
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 and I hear a weird noise in the background, I can identify it.

462
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 It's usually a car driving by a block away.

463
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 Late at night, sometimes people come roaring through in their cars.

464
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 The mic's that sensitive.

465
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 But when I was editing this episode, at a certain point,

466
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,500
 my heater had kicked on, and I got up to shut off my heater.

467
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 And I walk away from the mic, and you can hear me kind of moving through the room.

468
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 My heater's probably about 8, 10 feet away.

469
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 What is that in centimeters?

470
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 Like 5 centimeters?

471
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 I get up and I walk over there, and I shut my heater off.

472
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 And then when I'm editing the episode, I pick up a weird noise.

473
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 Now, obviously, the skeptic in me is thinking that

474
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 it's either the mic vibrating as I'm walking,

475
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 or my $1,300 mic is attached to a $10,

476
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 if that, more like a $5 folding chair,

477
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 and a $20 boom mic stand.

478
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 I have this super expensive microphone, and it's hooked up to--

479
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 and it's hooked up to bits and pieces I got on eBay.

480
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 I'm not trying to flex on you guys and saying how expensive my microphone is.

481
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
 I'm just trying to explain the sensitivity of the mic

482
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 versus the other equipment that's holding it together.

483
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 So it could have been a vibration.

484
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 It could have been anything.

485
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 I'm gonna play the clip in full so you can hear me walk away

486
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
 and then I'm gonna isolate the particular noise that is odd.

487
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 I've played it at various speeds.

488
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 I can't figure it out.

489
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 So here you guys go.

490
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 Just be careful where your seatbelts--

491
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 so anyways--

492
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
 [coughing]

493
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
 Let me go shut my heater off.

494
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 [sneezes]

495
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
 [sneezes]

496
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 I like to say flying a blimp is better than nothing,

497
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
 but I don't know.

498
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 Okay, so that was the full clip for context.

499
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 Some of you may have picked it up in the middle there.

500
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 I'm gonna go ahead and play it a few times back,

501
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 the little noise isolated in the middle.

502
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 I'll play it for you right now.

503
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 [coughing]

504
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 [coughing]

505
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 [coughing]

506
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 [coughing]

507
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 [coughing]

508
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 [coughing]

509
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 [coughing]

510
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 [coughing]

511
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 [coughing]

512
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 [coughing]

513
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
 [coughing]

514
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 [coughing]

515
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
 [coughing]

516
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 [coughing]

517
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 [coughing]

518
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 [coughing]

519
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 [coughing]

520
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Now, obviously, I think you can hear how sensitive the mic is.

521
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 You can actually hear my feet--

522
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 you can hear like my big, giant feet hitting the ground.

523
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 You can hear the "moo" as I'm walking,

524
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
 definitely when I'm playing it back to back.

525
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 But that weird noise,

526
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
 which is most likely some sort of vibration from the microphone,

527
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 from me walking back and forth.

528
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
 However, I've never heard it before.

529
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 It doesn't sound like anything,

530
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 but it does sound like something's talking.

531
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 Do I think I captured an EVP?

532
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 No.

533
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 But I do think it's interesting.

534
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 You're like, "Why'd you waste my time then?"

535
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 I do think it's interesting because it's definitely an anomaly,

536
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 and I think it can kind of explain how EVPs are made.

537
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 I mean, I guess there's a slight chance that I captured an EVP.

538
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,500
 I have talked about my apartment being haunted before,

539
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 but I've been doing this show for 130 episodes,

540
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 never picked up anything like that.

541
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 So, who knows?

542
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
 But I think it's more likely that it's vibration costs for me

543
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 walking from one point of the room to the other.

544
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 And I think that a lot of EVPs could also be chalked up

545
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 to normal noises in a house

546
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 that then our human brain is trying to assign some sort of pattern to.

547
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 Well, I hope you enjoyed the episode,

548
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 and I'm just going to play the outro right now

549
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 that I recorded earlier.

550
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 Have a great night, guys.
