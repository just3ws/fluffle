1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 The Mandela effect can often be explained by people simply misremembering details they were barely aware of in the first place.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 So what happens when two groups of super nerds begin to duke it out over whether or not Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise was constantly caressing his favorite crystal?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Now we take a look at a bizarre phenomenon that may have massive repercussions for the future of paranormal research.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Is it possible that all of the ghosts that haunt the world, whether it be in a lonely graveyard, a spooky house, or your bathroom,

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 is it possible that all of these ghosts are disappearing from planet Earth?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 First off, let's go ahead and introduce one of our newest patron supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Everyone, get up and give this guy a round of applause. It's Jeff, my name. Wooo!

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Come on in. I don't know if that's actually his handle or he typed it in wrong, but...

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Jeff, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Don't worry, just help spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot. You have no idea how much that helps.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Or maybe you do, and you are promoting the show, and in that case, thank you.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Jeff, let's go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. Get ready to blast off.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We are leaving behind the gravity of Earth. We are headed all the way out to the final frontier.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And Jeff flies us all the way up to the Star Trek universe.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Long time listeners of Dead Rabbit Radio know I'm a huge Trekkie. It's actually one of those things that I'm super embarrassed about.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I don't tell people that. I mentioned it maybe 400 episodes into the show. It was too late. You were already a listener of mine.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You couldn't hold your head in shame. I've been a Trekkie for a long time, really next generation, when it was originally on the air.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I was watching it week to week back then, and I watched it all the way up to Enterprise.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 That was the end of my Trek experience, but I was reading the books and all that stuff. Action figures. I love it.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I love the Star Trek universe. But I wouldn't call my... even though I'll use the term Trekkie, I'm not a Star Trek super fan.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Yes, I read every episode of the show and collect the toys and read the books, but that's still... I would still be considered a pleb by the people who really, really love the show Star Trek.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So when I came across this conspiracy theory fairly recently, it's been around for a couple years, but I hadn't heard of it before.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I kind of had to default to the super fans, because even though I've watched all the episodes of this show, I couldn't tell you whether or not this was true.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 What we're looking at here is one of the most interesting examples of the Mandela effect, because this is something that people obsessively know about.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 This is something that you have super fans about.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I 100% believe that the Berenstein Bears, that was the name of the book when I was growing up, and now it is the Berenstein Bears.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I know for a fact that was not the name of the book.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 But when you talk about stuff like Luke, "I am your father," I go, "Oh, that's just because the parody Saturday Night Live would make that line, and that line became more famous."

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 C-3PO has a silver leg now in the movies, and people go, "No, I just remember him being all yellow."

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I go, "Well, most of us are most familiar with C-3PO from The Toy."

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I think The Toy was all yellow.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Again, even though I like Star Wars and stuff like that, and I liked Fruit of the Loom underwear, I wasn't so invested in those brands that when people --

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 and especially the Nelson Mandela thing, I still don't know if he's dead now, right?

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But it's like when people go, "Oh, did you know Nelson Mandela died now?"

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And I thought he died years ago, and I was like, "I vaguely aware of when world leaders die."

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So most Mandela effects, Fruit Loops versus Fruit Loops, I don't know cereal that well.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And so I've always kind of just been like, "Maybe you're misremembering."

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But the Baron Stain Bears I know for a fact -- these are my favorite books.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 My favorite books involve me, the Family of Bears.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I know for a fact that that has changed.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But most of them I go, "Huh, maybe I have Fruit of the Loom cornucopia.

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Maybe I have, again, a vague regulation of that."

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But this Star Trek thing is interesting, though, because there's no one who is a hardcore fan of Fruit of the Loom underwear.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And even though you go, there's a lot of Star Wars fans, I can still -- I know why those lines got messed up,

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 just like "Life is like a box of chocolates" is easier and makes more sense than if you said "Life was like a box of chocolates."

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 He's saying, "My mama used to say, 'Life was like a box of chocolates.'

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Grammatically in the film, it was correct for Forrest Gump to say that,

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 but when you're repeating it to someone, it doesn't make sense to say, 'Life was like a box of chocolates.'

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You're like, 'What are you about to shoot me? Is my life over?'

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 So I get why there's those grammatical mistakes.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But this is super interesting, this Mandela effect, because you're having nerds duke it out.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And I want to give a shout out to -- there's a Discord server called the 8th Tower.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And it is a Discord server dedicated to the research of the paranormal and all of that stuff.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And I came across that on this. I wanted to give them a shout out.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 If you're looking for a Discord server that is really into cool paranormal topics, check them out.

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Check out the 8th Tower.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So that's where I found out about the story.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 So what is going on is back in 2017, a company called Roddenberry Entertainment,

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Gene Roddenberry is the creative Star Trek, a group called Roddenberry Entertainment,

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 started to sell an official replica of the Star Trek Next Generation Picard Desk Crystal.

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And this is the description for the world famous Picard Desk Crystal.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 "One of the most iconic props associated with Captain Jean-Luc Picard, his desk crystal,

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 appears prominently in no fewer than 78 episodes of Star Trek the Next Generation.

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Often in his hands during the iconic speeches on moral and ethical issues

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 that are so fundamental to the character of Star Trek's most rumative Captain."

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 I can guarantee there's people listening to me read that, that did a double take,

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 paused the podcast and went to go look this up.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And even though I would be considered a casual among hardcore Star Trek fans,

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I had no idea what they were talking about.

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Based on that, you would think it was as iconic as Captain Benjamin Sisko's baseball.

76
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 He had a baseball on his desk that he was constantly kind of tossing back and forth,

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 and he was coming up with stuff to think of.

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And what's so interesting was that was a piece of his personality.

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He was so tied to Earth.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 He was one of the few Captains who, even though he was in space, his heart was on Earth.

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Which was really interesting character trait, and the fact that he was the one who clinged the most to the past,

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 even though it hurt his soul, because he knew about the racism that came from Earth.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 The evils of the Earth and what Starfleet had come to represent and Federation had come to represent.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Fascinating character trait.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And I'm thinking if this Picard crystal is real, if he also was kind of like tossing this crystal back and forth,

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 playing catch, playing catch with Wesley Crusher with it, it kind of makes the baseball derivative.

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It kind of makes them go, "Well, you know, Picard had that crystal, so let's give Benjamin Sisko a baseball."

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 So it didn't make any sense to me when I was reading.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I don't remember him walking around with a crystal or having a crystal on his desk,

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 but there are video compilations of this crystal on his desk.

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And it's not a tiny little thing, right? It's about the size of your hand.

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Assuming you have normal sized hands. Sorry, Sasquatch.

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's pretty big. They were selling it for $100. It looks like it's all sold out at this point,

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 because it was from an alternate dimension. Of course, it was from a Mandela Effect world.

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 They were selling it for $100. It was a limited run, but there are videos of him holding it.

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And this caused a huge schism in the Star Trek community, because you had a lot of people go,

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 "Oh, yeah, I remember he was holding that crystal in certain episodes."

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 He did it sometimes, occasionally, in seasons one and two, but by season three,

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 he was manhandling that thing constantly. And yeah, he would sit there and he would kind of stroke it

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 as he was trying to come to a decision. Whenever he had some weighty choice to make,

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 he would be sitting there fidgeting with his crystal.

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But it was never explicitly mentioned, and it never played a plot in any storyline,

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 but I do remember that crystal in Star Trek The Next Generation.

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And then you have other people saying, "Not only do I not remember that crystal,"

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 even though they're looking at footage of this, right?

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 There's a couple compilation videos going around and screenshots,

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and nobody's arguing that these are fake,

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 but they're saying, "Not only do I not remember him ever stroking a crystal

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 when trying to come to a decision," it ruins his character.

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Quite a few people, because all of the links in the show notes are going to be to YouTube videos

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and to Reddit threads and to-- there's a forum dedicated to

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Alternate History Mandela Effect type of things. It's called Alternate Memories.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And there's also-- it was interesting, the Trek forum, the forum trekbbs.com,

114
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 was the one where people were like, "Oh, yeah, no, I totally remember that."

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 They're just sitting on his desk or he'd pick it up.

116
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 The one that was for that people would go to to only talk about Star Trek stuff,

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 they were the ones who'd be like, "Yeah, I totally remember that."

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And if you go to the Star Trek Wiki, Memory Alpha, I've spent-- I spent many an hour on there,

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 they also talk about the crystal. It's actually just in a page of crystals.

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 They're like, "One day, Odo turned into a crystal on this episode."

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And dilithium crystals are this. It was just kind of like a link page

122
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 and it mentioned Jean-Luc Picard's crystal that he held when he was ruminating over these decisions.

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But then you have other trekies who say, "This does not exist.

124
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I never noticed this in any Trek episode before."

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And not only do I not remember it, it ruins his character.

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 He was a man who was constantly making these decisions.

127
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And if he was like, "Oh, wait, before I figure out how we deal with the Tholians,

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 if anyone knows where my crystal's at, I need to rub it for good luck."

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 They're like, "It turns him into kind of a fidgety personality."

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Because even when he made a decision that he didn't necessarily agree with,

131
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 when he was going to go ahead and go and follow what the Federation was telling him to do

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 or to follow the Prime Directive, he still made it with assurity.

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Right, he'd tell Data, "No, you can't interfere with the issues on that planet.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 You can't. It's against the Prime Directive."

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He didn't then pick up a crystal and stroke it and go, "Was that the right decision?"

136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 So there's a war among the nerds, and I speak very highly of Star Trek nerds.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I am one of the nerds of the Star Trek universe because some of them say this did not exist.

138
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 This might be one of the most divisive Mandela effects yet.

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Because again, people who say, "No, no, no, it's not Berenstein.

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's Berenstain, and it's spelt like that, S-T-A-I-N."

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They just go, "Or not. I don't care. I don't really have anything invested in it.

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Maybe you misremembered it, whatever."

143
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 People who fight over when Nelson Mandela died, they just go, "I don't remember."

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But this one, people love this show so much.

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Star Trek, the next generation, is Ultimate Comfy Show, right?

146
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I used to form my white noise when I would sleep, and a lot of times when I'm doing research too,

147
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I'll just have something in the background. Sometimes it'll be the hum of the engine from the Enterprise D,

148
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 or the bridge sounds. There's YouTube video, I'll put it in the show notes because I know some of you guys are going to want to hear it.

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's eight hours of bridge noises from Star Trek, the next generation.

150
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It's just like normal operation. It's not like, "Ruddle or it, Ruddle or it, pew, pew!"

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Borgs assimilating people. That happens like seven hours into the video.

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 When you're deep asleep, you will be assimilated.

153
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 It's just droning. You hear, "Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew."

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And every show, often you hear footsteps, you'll hear a turbo lift open. It's dope, right?

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I know a lot of you guys are like, "Jason, you're really nerdy now about this."

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 At least go back to the Crystal thing, quit getting the Star Trek boner.

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So we have, this is rare when you have two groups of dedicated Superfans who are fighting over the Mandela Effect.

158
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 There's no Superfans fighting over how Fruit Loops is spelled, or how Looney Tunes is spelled.

159
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 There are people who say, "I remember this show. I remember every detail."

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And I do not remember 78 episodes with Picard having a Crystal in it.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But because people are Superfans, you can... The people who say, "No, the Crystal's real," they'll list the episodes.

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And if you watch the episodes now, apparently, I haven't had time to watch all these episodes for the research, the Crystal's in them.

163
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So weird. So, yeah, as of now, again, this thing, the Crystal went on sale...

164
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 That's when it came to people's attention. The Crystal went on sale from Roddenberry Entertainment in 2017.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And people were like, "What piece of garbage are you trying to sell? There is no Picard desk Crystal."

166
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And then people started to look into it and they go, "What? This is in the show."

167
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Sitting on his desk, he's holding it. At one point, Riker, apparently, is holding it on the bridge of the Enterprise.

168
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And it's funny, when I first came across this, I thought this is some sort of April Fool's joke,

169
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 or this is some sort of marketing gimmick, like someone invented something ridiculous,

170
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 and then said, "Let's say it was in Star Trek and Photoshopping into all of this stuff."

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And the more I researched it, I was like, "No, that doesn't appear. What's happened?"

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 You would have had to infiltrate all of these highly secure fandoms, all this highly secure Star Trek stuff, to pull it off.

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Maybe, right? You could do that. It's not like Memory Alpha is actually a computer somewhere in the Alpha Quadrant.

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It is just a website hosted on GoDaddy. But yeah, super weird.

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And then, as I'm researching this, and this is 8th Tower, there was a user on 8th Tower who really got into this.

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 I don't know what their name was. It was characters in a different language.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 He said he was posting this stuff about Picard's Crystal, and then he clipped out a YouTube comment.

178
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I thought this was really interesting. Talking again about the Mandela Effect, there is someone on YouTube

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 who goes by the name Jeffrey Adams. It might be the same Jeff who's the Patreon for this episode.

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Jeffrey Adams left a comment in one of these videos about the Mandela Effect and Picard's Crystal.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Jeffrey Adams says, "You know, this is talking about Mandela Effect. Here's a weird story.

182
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I heard a friend of mine was reading a copy of the Mothman book when it was first published.

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 That was what they actually said. I'm assuming they were talking about THE Mothman book, the Mothman prophecies,

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 and saying when first published would have placed the story around 1975.

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So my friend was reading a copy of THE Mothman book when it was first published, and one day she came home from work,

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and there were three men in black suits standing outside of her house."

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 She's walking--obviously you'd be curious about this, right? You'd be walking up there and you see these men

188
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 who obviously look like government officials. They're holding her copy of THE Mothman prophecies,

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 and they ask her, "Did you read this?" She says, "Yes."

190
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They begin asking her a few other questions, and then one of the men hands her a new copy of THE Mothman prophecies with a different cover.

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And they say, "We're gonna keep your copy. Here's a new copy of THE Mothman prophecies."

192
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And they left. And when she gets inside, she's reading the copy of THE Mothman prophecies that these men gave her,

193
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and there was information missing. She said it was a different book. It wasn't so completely different,

194
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 but apparently there was information missing and some chapters had changed.

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Now is that story true? It's from a YouTube comment, right? It may or may not be true.

196
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 When you talk about the world of the paranormal, a lot of it is firsthand or secondhand information.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 That's just the nature of the beast. But an interesting story, if true, right? An interesting story.

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And that could explain how some of these Mandela artifacts do disappear.

199
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Fascinating story, and again, people don't really fight over Fruit of the Loom,

200
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 or what the name of this television show was or whatever, but super fans are going to war.

201
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They are in conflict with each other.

202
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 This crystal never ever existed, and if it did, it ruins Picard's character.

203
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And I think if this crystal did exist, it does make Benjamin Sisko's baseball derivative.

204
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Like, it kind of make--it kind of cheapens it.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 If--you know what I mean? It's fascinating. It's super weird.

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I love it. I love this conspiracy theory. I'll--any excuse. I can talk about Star Trek. I'm down.

207
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 If you remember the crystal, check out some of the videos. Check out some of the videos. See what people are saying.

208
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 It's just a weird thing that's going on.

209
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Super fans, people who obsess over every detail of the show, are fighting over whether or not this crystal exists.

210
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And by all accounts, it looks like it does.

211
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Jeff, my name--I'm going to go ahead and attach you to the keys of the carbonic copter.

212
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You go ahead and fly back down to Earth. I got some time to spend in the holodeck.

213
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 *SPLAT*

214
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 While I am experiencing a lesson in logic from T-Pole, go ahead and take the rest of the crew down to Earth.

215
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Specifically, fire of that carbonic copter, we're headed out to the United Kingdom.

216
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 *DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUM

217
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 *SPLAT*

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 *SPLAT*

219
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 *SPLAT*

220
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Now, Dr. Paul Lee, he's written books about ghosts and things like that.

221
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Recently, he was interviewed by the Daily Star. It's a British tabloid.

222
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's a lot of cli--and not necessarily clickbait. It's just the weirdest stories.

223
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And they don't necessarily make things up, but they exaggerate a lot.

224
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 A lot of doomsday stuff. Like, Nostradamus predicted that this Tuesday the world's going to end.

225
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So, just to let you know where this is coming from, and while Dr. Paul is talking about his app,

226
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 which he's getting the word out about this thing he's developed,

227
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 he makes this comment that could have radical implications for the world of paranormal research,

228
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and makes his--this is what I find so weird about it--makes his app useless.

229
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So, I don't know if he's trying to spread the word that his app exists,

230
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 but if he--if he is, he's doing a bad job at it, because what he's saying is basically saying this app

231
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 will become useless very shortly. Fascinating. Which makes me think that he believes this is a real problem.

232
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I don't think that he is just trying to get press. If he is, he's doing a bad job at it.

233
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I think he might be trying to warn us that there is something really serious going on in the world of the paranormal.

234
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 What Dr. Paul is saying is to keep his app updated, he will constantly be calling and emailing people who own haunted houses.

235
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Because he puts it in the app saying this house on Sheffield is haunted.

236
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's haunted by a ghost that kicks kittens as they're walking down the stairs.

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 He has to stay in contact with the owners of these locations to see if the activity is still there.

238
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Maybe there's new activity, right? And for locations that aren't private property,

239
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 he would try to talk to people who had experienced hauntings there and get their feedback for the app.

240
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 But he goes, "Since January 2020, he's noticed that haunted places in England are experiencing less activity."

241
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 He says he's been sending out these letters and making these phone calls, and since January 2020, he's gotten 800 replies back.

242
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And many of them are saying there's no ghost activity here anymore.

243
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 In fact, there hasn't been ghost activity here in a while.

244
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 If he's inputting the information from books and accounts of people that he's getting from articles,

245
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 and then he's contacting these people to get updates, they're saying nothing's happening.

246
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It used to be haunted, we used to get these reports, but now, nope, nothing.

247
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And he says this even includes famous haunted places in England.

248
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It's not just a house that might have changed hands.

249
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Like, one owner says that the house is haunted, the house gets sold, someone else comes in and doesn't have any issues with it.

250
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's not just stuff like that. He says that there are famous haunted places in the UK that are no longer haunted.

251
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And this poses a super interesting question for paranormal researchers.

252
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 What is happening to the ghosts?

253
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Because we can extrapolate this. Again, this is not a skeptic.

254
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 This is someone who believes in ghosts who makes money off of the existence of ghosts and has launched an app that directs you to go to various haunted locations.

255
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 If there are no ghosts, his career is, it affects his bottom line.

256
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And it's so interesting.

257
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I would have figured someone who came up with a UK ghost app would have gone into the Daily Star and said ghost sightings are up 400%.

258
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 The Daily Star would have ran that headline and he could have been like, yeah, using my app now there's 400% more ghosts, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

259
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And the Daily Star would have ran that headline and he could have been like, "Yeah, using my app now there's 400% more ghosts."

260
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 No, he's saying they're disappearing.

261
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And I think we could probably extrapolate that out.

262
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It may be disappearing all over.

263
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 He's the first person to find out because he was doing a mass checkup on ghost sightings in UK.

264
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And no one's really doing that.

265
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 If this theory is true, if there are less ghosts now, if these famously haunted places are no longer haunted,

266
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 and these places, these famously haunted places also make their money, or a portion of their money, from ghost chores and from ghost souvenirs.

267
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So they also have a vested interest in lying.

268
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And that's what makes this story honestly a little concerning because now we have two groups of people, places that are famously haunted, historically haunted,

269
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 and a paranormal researcher both saying there's less ghost activity than there was in the previous years.

270
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Why?

271
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So there's a couple different theories that are presented.

272
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 There's been a couple articles written about this since this discovery by Dr. Lee has come out.

273
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So what could be the reason, right?

274
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 What could be the reason that paranormal activity, specifically ghost, ghostly activity is disappearing?

275
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Well, it's interesting.

276
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 So if you read in this article from MysteriousUniverse.org, these are the different reasons what could be causing this.

277
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I mean, again, we don't know.

278
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 We don't even know what causes ghosts in the first place.

279
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Other than, you know, we think that it's spirits of people who have passed on, but there's all even sorts of theories like that, that it's time displacement,

280
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 that it's a recording that you can't actually interact with.

281
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 You're just watching an event appearing over and over and over again like a VHS tape.

282
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 You can't interfere with the actual event.

283
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Who knows, right?

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 There's a lot of questions about what ghosts are.

285
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 But looking at the possible theories that what could be causing this, if Dr. Lee's theory is true,

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 and again, I find it very interesting that a man who's trying to promote his ghost app is saying there's less ghosts to find.

287
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Let's take a look at a couple of these different theories.

288
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 One is that what happened was there was an artificial boom in ghostly activity.

289
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 That a lot of these places were never really haunted to begin with.

290
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And this is so fascinating.

291
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 In the early 2000s to probably about the mid-2000s, I don't know how many of these shows still exist, but there was a lot of these ghost hunter shows out.

292
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 You had ghost hunters, you had paranormal state, you had the one that Zach Baggins did, he might still do it.

293
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 You had all of these reality shows come out and they were a hungry for content.

294
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 So they would go to these places that may have been slightly spooky, run down insane asylum, which is just as spooky as a well-maintained insane asylum.

295
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But graveyards and cemeteries and all of these historical places and they say, "Oh my God, this place is haunted. Look out, cameraman, look out!"

296
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Start shaking, start shaking, the camera camera man starts shaking.

297
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 "Oh no, run, run!"

298
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And all this stuff.

299
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 So you had an artificial boom out of these 800 places that he's writing these letters to.

300
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 A good chunk of them may have not have been haunted at all.

301
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They were basically spooky sets that these ghost hunter shows went to.

302
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That's really fascinating theory.

303
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I know it's not one that a lot of ghost enthusiasts want to know.

304
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 A lot of you people who love the dead want to hear, but it is something to take into account.

305
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 It absolutely is something to take into account and fascinating theory.

306
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The other one is also a scientific theory.

307
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And that's the fact that you have a lot of amateur ghost hunters going out there with equipment that they don't know how to use.

308
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 People bringing out spirit boxes, people bringing out those temperature meters or thermometers.

309
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 You basically are sticking the thermometer in a ghost butt.

310
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 You have all this stuff.

311
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 So you have some amateurs, which I do.

312
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I love ghost hunting and I promote ghost hunting and I think everyone should do it.

313
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 It's really, really fun.

314
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 But you should know how to use your equipment.

315
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And it's possible that people were going into these locations and they were picking up all of these rings.

316
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Oh no, the temperature just dropped 20 degrees.

317
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 They don't understand that they're walking right by an open window or underneath an air conditioner vent or something like that.

318
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 And so that place is marked as haunted.

319
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And it was actually considered haunted or called haunted by people who were measuring the activity in the wrong way.

320
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 They're bringing in a medium who's not an actual medium, who's a fraudster and they go, "Oh, this place is haunted."

321
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 It gets marked down as a haunted location.

322
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And then when you contact that place a couple years later, they go, "Oh no, we haven't seen any ghosts here."

323
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Because it was never haunted to begin with.

324
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Or maybe there was just a creepy feeling and someone called in a ghost reality show.

325
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 They go back to that one or called in some local ghost hunters and they quote, unquote, "verify that it was haunted" and it wasn't.

326
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 So that's an interesting theory.

327
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Both of those go with the skeptical side.

328
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 It could have been artificially inflated numbers to begin with.

329
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Fascinating.

330
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Then we have a third theory, which is something that we've talked about a lot on this show.

331
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And I think all ghost hunters kind of have to talk about it.

332
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Why don't we see the ghost of cavemen?

333
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And the idea has always been that ghost energy dissipates over a matter of time.

334
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 That's always been the answer to that.

335
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 It's never actually been proven.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 But otherwise, how come we don't see ghosts of cavemen?

337
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Really, if you think about it, ghosts that we see today tend to be from the Elizabethan era forward.

338
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So recently dead people going all the way back to women in big frilly dresses walking down a hallway with no head.

339
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 But that seems to be a hard stop around there.

340
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We never hear people about, "Yeah, dude, I went to Egypt.

341
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I saw King Tut and he was doing that little Egyptian stance.

342
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 It's super spooky and kind of funny at the same time."

343
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Byzantine era ghosts running around with their spears through the desert.

344
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Like that normally doesn't get reported.

345
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I don't know if any ghost hunters are in the middle of the Gobi Desert, but there may be some.

346
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 We don't see ghosts going super far back.

347
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 We don't see ghosts from those time periods or any other.

348
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 So it could be that's always kind of been accepted in the paranormal world and accepted answer that ghost have an energy that dissipates over time.

349
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I think the only caveat you could find to that is we do see ghosts of Native American spirits.

350
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And you could argue that those are pre-colonialism.

351
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You could argue that those spirits existed before the conquistadors or before the pilgrims, the Europeans came.

352
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 But we don't know. We don't know the time period of the ghost of Native Americans we see.

353
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 But I think just based on everything else that's going on in the world, it probably is ghost of Native Americans from the same time period of Elizabethan era.

354
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 1700s, 1600s, stuff like that.

355
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 What?

356
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Newsflash, people die every day.

357
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 So even if we were losing the ghosts of yesteryear, it should constantly be refreshed with new ghosts.

358
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 One theory that I have that could be causing that is that this is very troubling too.

359
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Is that the phenomenon we know as ghosts may be disappearing.

360
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Like the energy that actually allows ghosts to manifest on Earth may be the whole energy grid itself that allows ghosts to exist on this planet may be disappearing.

361
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 The phenomenon of ghosts may soon go the way of their corporeal body.

362
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So think about it this way.

363
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Since the beginning of time till about the 1800s, it was just accepted scientific fact or religious principle that a human could shape shift into an animal.

364
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Every single culture on the planet had a variation of humans shape shifting into animals.

365
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 That's gone.

366
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 That is completely gone from the world.

367
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 If you told someone, I think there's a ghost in my house.

368
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 There are a lot of people, some people don't believe in ghosts and they'll be like, "Oh, whatever buddy.

369
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 As they're getting possessed as they're floating there.

370
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Like, I don't know what you're talking about.

371
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.

372
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 You're like, "You're hovering, you're hovering."

373
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 You're not even sitting in a chair anymore.

374
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 If you told someone you had a ghost in your house, you'd have a lot of people believe you.

375
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 If you told someone that you were walking home and you saw a guy walk out of subway and he gets then eating his foot long and then he looks both ways and then he morphs into a rat and crawls into the sewer.

376
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 No one's going to believe that.

377
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Nobody's going to believe that.

378
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 If you told someone that you knew a guy who meditated all day long and you went to this retreat to become part of his group, they'd be very concerned that you joined a cult and you're like, "No, no, no, no, no."

379
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And then, like on the third day, I don't know why he didn't do this on the first two days of the retreat.

380
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 He wanted to save the best for last.

381
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 On the third day, he turned into a raven in front of all of us and he flew away and he goes, "No refunds, no refunds."

382
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 He flies away.

383
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 People would assume your drink got spiked.

384
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 People would assume you did join a cult and you had gone crazy.

385
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 But 400 years ago, they totally would have believed you.

386
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 They probably wouldn't have burnt you as a witch in most places, but they would have believed that that phenomenon was possible.

387
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Same thing with angels, same thing with miracles, just like out in the blue miracles.

388
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Not like I prayed really hard and my loved one recovered straight up, prayed really hard and a miracle happened.

389
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Like a new wall appeared on my house.

390
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I knew I knew it's an inner body house from that raven and only had three walls, but he said no refunds.

391
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 The age of miracles, the visible miracles has ended.

392
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 The age of visitations of angels in physical form has ended.

393
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 The age of the shape shifter, the age of the evil eye.

394
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 There were laws against people giving you the evil eye.

395
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 It was just a known part of society, curses and stuff like that.

396
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 That has all fallen to the wayside and it's all fallen to the wayside relatively recently in human history.

397
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 You could say, "Well, it's because we understand science now. We understand the way things work."

398
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 We know that stuff isn't real anymore.

399
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 But it could also be that the mechanisms that allowed those things to exist in our physical world decayed over time.

400
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 So they weren't observable. By the time we built the microscope, you couldn't find...

401
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You could see a little amoeba start growing hair and go, "Arrrrrrr!"

402
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 It doesn't exist anymore.

403
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And a lot of people say they never existed, but it was just stuff that would happen all over the globe.

404
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And cultures that never talked to each other, we see these similarities.

405
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And so that may have faded away and we may be seeing a similar fading away of the energy that allows a ghost to exist.

406
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 It doesn't mean that when you die, your soul just disappears.

407
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 But it means that when you die, the ability for your soul to remain on Earth for a period of time,

408
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 that energy, that whatever you're drawing off of to take that form in our world may be leaving, may be gone.

409
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 So it's interesting to think, science has never really studied the phenomenon of ghosts in any real fashion.

410
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 And within 200 years, 300 years, there may be no ghosts anywhere on the planet.

411
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 At all.

412
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And people will look back at stories of ghosts and be like, "Well, that's ridiculous."

413
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Like, people actually used to believe that a phantom would walk down the hallway to be fair.

414
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 There are people who believe that now, but there may be a time when no one sees a ghost.

415
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And in the same way that society as a whole has turned away from the evil eye and from angelic intervention and from angels showing up.

416
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Like, people still believe those things, but they're more scoffed at than UFOs or ghosts.

417
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 And we may see...the reason why people still go ghost exists is because they have encounters with them.

418
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Lots of people have encounters with ghosts.

419
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 But if this matrix, if this power that allows ghosts to appear on Earth disappears, then all those stories end.

420
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And they just become little superstitious things in books.

421
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And then eventually the books stop getting published and it just becomes this thing that, man, humanity for like 10,000 years from the beginning of civilization up till around the mid-2000s, right?

422
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 2050, people talked about ghosts all the time, but no one's seen a ghost in 100 years.

423
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Interesting theory, what's powering ghosts may be disappearing, but let's put on our carpenter caps here and wrap this episode up like this.

424
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 What if there's something big coming in the world of the paranormal?

425
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Something that's so dark and evil, it's scaring ghosts away.

426
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 What if there's something out there and it may not even be an it.

427
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 It may be an event.

428
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Just like how before there's an earthquake, often times animals will know.

429
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Or when there is a tsunami like that Boxer Day tsunami that happened quite a few years ago, you had animals just run...

430
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Before the tsunami even showed up, you had animals just running up to the highest point they could find.

431
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 They sensed it was coming.

432
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 They didn't have any of the fancy devices that humans had, but they knew something was coming and they got to high ground before the humans even saw the first signs of the tsunami.

433
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 So what if there is something big coming that ghosts are afraid of?

434
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 And so they're staying away.

435
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 A ghost that would normally go, "Well, you know, I don't know if I want to leave yet. I see that light at the end of the tunnel, but I have some time on work."

436
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Now there's other ghosts that are like, "No, no, no, hurry up. Get in the light. Get in the light."

437
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Something bad is headed towards Earth.

438
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's creepy because you think about it like the end of the world, battle of Armageddon type stuff.

439
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 A demonic entity that's ready to finally make a move against the natural order.

440
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Something old and dark and evil that's been a long time setting up the chessboard.

441
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 The world of the paranormal has always just kind of been there. It's secondary to all of this stuff, right?

442
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 It's just what happens. Ghosts are kind of floating around doing their thing.

443
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 But like animals, before the tsunami hits, they realize that what's coming is impossible to stop and it is world-ending.

444
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Are ghosts leaving Earth because they sense something is about to happen?

445
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Something that could even pose a threat to an undead spirit.

446
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Maybe they're headed to safety. Maybe they're choosing sides in this all-out war between good and evil.

447
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 The problem is, is we don't study the paranormal phenomenon in any real way, so we don't know what this means.

448
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 It could be nothing, or it could be the first warning humanity has.

449
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 The first warning that something big and unstoppable is headed our way.

450
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 But if we don't even understand what causes ghosts in the first place, how can we understand?

451
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 How could we hope to prepare for what is staring at our world with envious eyes?

452
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Imagine what could scare a ghost. That is what humanity could be facing.

453
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Very, very soon.
