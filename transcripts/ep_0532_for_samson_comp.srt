1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 Hey guys, I'm uploading this episode early for reasons that'll be apparent once you start listening to it.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,760
 We're still gonna have five episodes this week, but this is technically Thursday's episode.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,040
 I'm just uploading it Tuesday night. Does that make sense? So I hope you guys enjoy this special episode of Der Rabe Radio.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,200
 A medical mystery the internet can't even figure out?

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,800
 Is it possible that Bigfoot has a much tinier and easier to catch cousin?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,680
 And then we take a look at what happens when two boys go out exploring one day in the year 1976.

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 They see a door in a cave and think it may lead to riches or mystery.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,520
 Instead, it leads them right into the realm of the paranormal today on a very special episode

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
 of Der Rabe Radio.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Der Rabe Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,760
 You know, you know, I always want to say I'm having a great day, but you know, we got a little bit of bad news today.

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,480
 A long time listener of the show,

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,960
 Samson the dog

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,800
 is not long for this world. Put up a good fight, but

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,640
 he doesn't have much time left. He doesn't have much time left.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,760
 So I actually got an email from a listener of the show named Sean.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,480
 He actually helped with a story a while back. Gattington Canyon. I used him as a source for that story.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,200
 And he emailed me today and he said

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 he would go out and he would listen to Der Rabe Radio and he'd play with his dog.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,360
 Play casual tug-of-war with him and stuff like that. To the point that Samson, he's three and a half year old German shepherd,

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,280
 got to realize that when Sean picked up his phone and his Bluetooth speaker, it was time to play.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
 Because that's what he got to listen to the show. He'd take it out there. He'd listen to the show.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
 And Samson, he'd say we're out of the door and start whining. Come on, come on, come on.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,800
 He goes, "I feel like Samson loved the show as much as I did."

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,960
 And he also said that there are so many memories he has of him laughing at the show and laughing at his dog doing crazy stuff.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,400
 And you want me to mention this too. His dog got diagnosed with something. He said I was going to mispronounce him, but

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,480
 his dog got diagnosed with something called leptos pariasis.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,800
 It's so common. The vets, veterinarians actually recommend

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
 getting your dog vaccinated once a year

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,840
 because the risk factor is being a dog. The risk factor is swimming in lakes, jumping in rivers,

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
 chasing ducks. Any sort of, anytime they interact with wild animals or urine,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,120
 which is kind of the main thing dogs do, right? They can catch this disease.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,760
 And it's one of those diseases that you don't know about.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
 And then your dog gets sick and you're like, what's going on in the veterinarian? It's like, well, it's that thing, Jase.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
 And can't pronounce.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
 And you think, oh, I should have had it vaccinated if I had known more, but it's just something that people aren't fully aware of.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
 So we wanted to bring awareness to that.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,440
 And we wanted to make this episode dedicated to Sampson. Sampson's going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,040
 He's a good old boy. Give him a bunch of love. And I actually went and I found some funny stories to talk about.

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
 I originally had a really depressing episode planned, but no, for Sampson's episode,

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,400
 we're going to do some more fun stuff.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,200
 Fun stuff. The last story is a little dark, but funner than I had planned.

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,160
 And I also am going to play a song from one of my favorite bands, the best local band, I believe, Sun Diver.

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,760
 I stick around for that song. It is a beautiful song, a modern lullaby. That'll be the end of the episode.

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,240
 That song is dedicated to Sampson.

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,520
 And that song is dedicated to everybody who's ever lost anyone they've ever cared about.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,040
 So I'm going to dangle. Look at little Sampson. He's such a good boy. Ringo Pet him. Everyone give him a big old pet.

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,920
 Show him some love. Give him a good get right between the ears.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
 We are going to hand him the keys to all of our vehicles.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,440
 He is going to be our captain or pilot this episode. I got some fun stories, some funny stuff.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,080
 Because the episode I originally had planned was super depressing. So I was like, oh, let's get a little Sampson. A little good boy.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
 Let's find some fun adventures that we can go on with Sampson. So Sampson,

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,160
 first off, we're going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. And we're going to take a ride in this story.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
 You may not appreciate Sampson. It's like, seriously? You made me anthropomorphic for this.

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,200
 We're going to Stockton, California, aka Meth Capital of the World. Yes, it's one of those stories.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,440
 So little Sampson's driving the car.

57
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,880
 We're driving out to Stockton, California. He's like, I don't want to be in the meth episode, bro. You're a good boy. You're a good boy.

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,160
 So the other day, this is just the way that the internet works and my mind, it's bad to have those two things combined.

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,920
 One day I was sitting at the coffee shop. This was actually months and months ago. I've had this story in my maybe folders.

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
 It's not, it wasn't maybe because

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,640
 I didn't have any faith in it. I'm really intrigued by this story, but

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,720
 people on the back end, the personal friends of mine, when I tell them about this, they're like, dude, that's so gross. Don't talk about that.

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
 But here we are. It was Sampson's choice. He picked it. He picked it. He's like shaking his head.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
 I was on the internet a couple months ago and for whatever reason, I wanted to look at people who got

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,560
 people who got burned up by meth. This is a real, real problem, right? You're making your homebrew meth. It's an explosion.

66
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,480
 It's a chemical explosion. It tears off several layers of skin. It's terrible.

67
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 So I went to type in meth burns and I misspelled it.

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,560
 I spelt meth burbs. A picture of Stockton, California came up.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,000
 Meth burbs actually auto corrected to meth burbs and I was like, what? Is this a thing?

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,640
 Is this a medical mystery? Like I said in the beginning, you're like, this is not a medical mystery. Hold on.

71
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,360
 It's a digestive mystery. So if you look up meth burbs, I mean, it's up to you guys. You may have better things to do.

72
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,200
 But if you look up meth burbs, it's weird because some people, it's one of those things that happens

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,000
 a lot to a select group of people. You may say these people are the elites. They're the chosen meth users.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,640
 Because one person asked on Quora, hey, why do I burp a lot when I'm coming down off meth? And nobody responded to the question.

75
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,480
 Which is weird because you figure like, you know, there's always this weird like meth brotherhood where people are always trying to give each other tips.

76
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,440
 The tip is get more meth. That's their advice for everything. But it was weird someone stated this question.

77
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,640
 No one answered it. So now I'm intrigued. I'm like, is there truly only one

78
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,080
 meth burper out there? Is this guy the chosen one? Is this the nobody of the meth community?

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
 So I kept digging. At that point, whatever I was researching was put on the back burner.

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,760
 I needed to learn more about meth burbs. And I found one question that actually had some answers to it.

81
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,840
 So someone, this one was very specific. This one wasn't just, this one just isn't, does meth cause burps?

82
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
 This is, does smoking meth

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
 cause sulfur burps?

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,880
 Oh, it's demonic maybe. It's paranormal. It fits the show.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,800
 So there's a guy named Tony who wrote this on Quora. Yes, it does. There was one answer for this question.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,920
 Yes, it does. And he wrote, the last time I smoked meth, I ate a roast beef and cheddar sandwich right before smoking.

87
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,880
 An hour later,

88
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,280
 What point are you like? I want to adjust this noxious chemical into my lungs.

89
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,200
 But first let's go to Arby's. Watch it. Those two go together. Arby's is basically the fast food equivalent of meth.

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,440
 It's the grossest restaurant that only the grossest people go to, right? I've never, I, there was one time

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,520
 I was with a group of friends. There was an Arby's, maybe two blocks

92
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
 from where we lived.

93
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,000
 In the three years we lived there, we went to Arby's a single time. And I, maybe we were just tired of Del Taco, but

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 we went to Arby's.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
 But your meth head's working there? The manager's a meth head.

96
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,920
 He says he ate a roast beef and cheddar sandwich right before smoking it. And then afterwards he got

97
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,720
 sulfur egg burps, is how he described it.

98
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,400
 And then he had violent nausea and diarrhea. I'm assuming this guy did go to Arby's.

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 I don't think he made this roast beef sandwich at home. But he said that, I love this, this is his quote here.

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
 "I must be sensitive to one of the nasty chemicals used to produce meth."

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
 Okay, that's, that's likely, right?

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,280
 It is a nasty chemical and a humid body would be sensitive. But that's not where he finishes his sentence.

103
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,160
 He keeps going on because that wouldn't mean he couldn't smoke meth anymore. He continues.

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,520
 "I must be sensitive to one of the nasty chemicals used to produce meth and

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:41,360
 I will never eat anything of significance again before smoking it." Good on you, Tony. Good on you for putting two and two together. Yes.

106
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,120
 I'm ingesting this, I'm ingesting floor cleaner.

107
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,840
 And I'm having violent diarrhea. The answer is to keep doing that.

108
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,720
 But no longer eat.

109
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
 Someone else asked. I had to go to Reddit. I was really looking this up. Someone else on Reddit said,

110
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
 "What if I shot up? What if I use an IV? Would that, this is what's interesting.

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,880
 If I use an IV, if I injected meth straight into my veins,

112
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,840
 would I still burp?"

113
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,760
 At that point, the least of your worries is your burping habit.

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
 You're injecting methamphetamines. But anyways, it doesn't.

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,080
 You would think that it was the smoking

116
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,800
 going into your lungs and all the nasty chemicals and the roast beef and cheddar sandwich. They should make flavored meth.

117
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,840
 You should have like, like tropical bunch flavored meth. They're like, feel the breeze.

118
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,960
 You turn into Kool-Aid. You basically are the Kool-Aid man on meth. You're breaking into people's houses.

119
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,400
 You're knocking down their walls.

120
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,320
 But he says, "No, they were saying that even if you inject it, you're going to be hit up with it."

121
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,960
 So I know what you guys are thinking. Jason, you should have left that in the maybe folder.

122
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,120
 It's a medical mystery and sulfur, sulfur is the smell of the devil.

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,880
 So it works. It's a mystery and it's demonic.

124
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,720
 And Samson's just kind of giving me the side eye right now, tapping his little paw on the steering wheel.

125
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,560
 Are we going to go to the next story? Yes. Yes, we are. First, let me do my advertising read for Arby's.

126
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,680
 I do that real quickly. And then Samson, we're going to toss you the keys to the

127
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,720
 Jason Jet. We're going to go high in the sky. We're going to take off.

128
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,360
 We're actually going to go back in time as well to the year 1944.

129
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,040
 Now this story is more dog appropriate. This story, Samson's going to be out running through the woods

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,000
 because it's the year 1944 and we're at Bly Mountain Lookout in Oregon.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,720
 Samson's running around. Sean's throwing the ball to him. Samson's having a ball. We're all having a ball.

132
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
 Sean's throwing the ball to us as well. We're intercepting the ball from Samson. Samson's like,

133
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,440
 dang it, go on. We're playing Keep Away. But we give him the ball. He's a good boy. But then we want it back.

134
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,000
 We want it back. Trying to get it from him. This was actually a recommendation from DruthersCA on Twitter.

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,440
 He actually sent this to me a bit ago and it's a pretty interesting story. So thank you DruthersCA.

136
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,320
 1944, it's Bly Mountain Lookout. And Bud Darkor and his younger brother are walking through the woods.

137
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,360
 And they see a bright light fly out of the sky. And they can tell where it lay into. They go,

138
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,560
 that's about two miles away based on the way that trees are planted and the sun and the way I can

139
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,720
 judge distances. So they set off to see what this thing actually was. And they see a burnt patch

140
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,560
 of ground about 30 feet in diameter. So they get down there, they see this burnt patch in the ground

141
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,280
 and they're looking at it and they're like, okay, well, I don't know what we expected, right? I mean,

142
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,440
 obviously you expected a UFO, but you come down and you see some burnt grass and they're like,

143
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
 oh, that's pretty cool looking. But okay, we looked at it like we didn't bring a camera or anything.

144
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,920
 So they start heading back to the way they came. And then they see tracks, little footprints,

145
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,160
 in the soil. And they're like, hey, come here, come here, younger brother. They never named you,

146
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,920
 parents never named you. Look, look at these tracks and the brother's like, oh my god. Those are the

147
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,080
 smallest tracks I've ever seen before, little footprints. And they have stumbled across the

148
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:15,840
 mystery known as babyfoot. We all know Bigfoot, right? King of the forest, giant ape man who

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,040
 smells like sulfur, must be smoking a bunch of meth. Maybe that's why we can never find them,

150
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
 because we're going to raid his factory. We all know about Bigfoot. Babyfoot is actually very

151
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,120
 well known organ. Now throughout America, I shouldn't say throughout America, but there's a lot of

152
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,760
 parts of America that have old Native American legends of tiny warriors that they had to fight

153
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,560
 off to take the land, like going way, way back in time. Like in the Central America, not Central

154
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,720
 America, but in the central part of the United States of America, you have like tribes of these

155
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,960
 like tiny little people that were like cannibals and they've done episodes on them in the past,

156
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,560
 but I don't remember their specific name, but biting on people and stuff like that, which is kind

157
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,080
 of implied through the cannibalism. But in Oregon, it's different. There are no one as babyfoot.

158
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,920
 They were never considered by the natives to actually be little humans. They were considered

159
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,960
 to be little hairy people walking around. Not saying if you're hairy, you can't be a human,

160
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,440
 but they were considered to be basically a relative of Bigfoot. Their footprints are only

161
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
 four and a half inches long, tiny little guys. They're walking around. Now, but in his brother,

162
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
 they ended up like getting the Forest Service involved and the Forest Service comes out there

163
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,120
 and then there's like government official out there as well. And they are like, "Look at these

164
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
 tiny footprints. What could have possibly have made these footprints?" The actual official answer at

165
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,320
 that time, the government official said that it's possible that what you saw and what left these

166
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,640
 footprints was a monkey. They're like, "How did a monkey get in the middle of the woods?" And the

167
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,520
 government official said, "It must have fallen out of an airplane." So that's not right, right?

168
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 Like yes, I get it. Monkeys can fall out of airplanes. They're not walking away from it.

169
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,680
 And if they did, their footprints are going to be quite bloody. They're going to be all

170
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,000
 staggering and stuff like that. I'm not saying test it. I'm not saying build a lab, build a wind tunnel

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
 and start dropping monkeys. But I think we can dismiss that out of hand. There actually is a

172
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
 reasonable explanation for those footprints. But before we get into that, before I poo poo all

173
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,800
 over baby Bigfoot, let's talk a little bit more about people who actually believed in them.

174
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
 So like I said, the Native Americans, they've had tons of stories about these things. And there's a

175
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,240
 lot of places in Oregon named after these guys. You have Babyfoot Creek, Babyfoot Lake Botanical

176
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,560
 Area. You have that. You have Baby Rock. They just left a foot off of that one. They're just like,

177
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,360
 "That's rock. We're not going to mention the baby foots with this legend because this legend actually

178
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,480
 involved two dudes sleeping under the rock. They're out hunting. This is like old, old-timey Native

179
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,000
 American times. They're out hunting and they were like, "Oh, I hope someone else catches an elk

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,520
 today because I'm sleepy." So they fall asleep, but they wake up and someone's biting them. And

181
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,720
 they assume it's the other dude sleeping next to them. They're like, "Oh, I didn't know you fell

182
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,840
 that way." It was actually a baby foots attacking them. And the bite is poisonous. They didn't tell

183
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,080
 him that. They didn't, they did not tell them that when they went out there. Shaman has a lot to

184
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,280
 answer for about that. He's like, "Yeah, sorry I didn't tell you about the poisonous tiny people

185
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,000
 out there before you took a nap. You're supposed to be hunting anyways." Anyways, they died. So then

186
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,800
 the tribe goes, "Okay, we're going to get those little guys back." So they stood there out in the

187
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,680
 woods and they just were waiting for the baby foots to come back. And they see a little, little dude

188
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,720
 walking by one night, a little guy. And they jump on top of them. They throw a blanket around them

189
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,520
 and they tie it closed. And they're like, "We got this cryptid. This thing that, I mean, people have

190
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,760
 been hunting big foots forever." And they caught one in a bag and they set it on fire. They burned

191
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,560
 it alive. They kill it. So they just assume that they got the baby foot. But of course, with big

192
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,720
 foot, the legend big foot, there's multiples of these things. And you would, throughout Oregon,

193
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,200
 you'd have, sometimes they were more civilized. Sometimes they would have poison arrows. They

194
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,520
 actually had weapons. Sometimes they just walk around and bite you. Sometimes they're cannibals.

195
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,440
 That goes with the biting thing. However, big foot has, the best thing big foot has going for him

196
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,280
 is his ability to leave no evidence behind where he's been. It's a really good trick.

197
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,080
 And this, his size, right? You're not going to mess with big foot. Even if big foot didn't mess

198
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,200
 around, he's still bigger than a gorilla. He's about the size of a black bear. So baby foot doesn't

199
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,360
 have the size going for him, but he does have poison ability. So that's kind of cool. If he was

200
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,360
 Pokemon card, that's like his plus. However, these cryptids were so lame. One, you could,

201
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,680
 you could capture them, which is pretty much the number one thing cryptids can't have happen to

202
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,720
 them. Two, their main predator wasn't humans. It wasn't even other baby foot fighting for tribal

203
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,240
 supremacy. It was, it was birds. Bigel condors would come down and grab these guys and fly off

204
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,560
 into the distance. I don't really think you can even call yourself a cryptid. I don't care about

205
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,920
 the height. Like we've covered tiny cryptids before. We've covered like microscopic cryptids

206
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,440
 and the little tiny guys that were in Africa riding on ants and stuff like that. A botwaw or

207
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,720
 something like that. So the size doesn't matter, but none of those guys got killed by like the common

208
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,360
 crow or just, you know, like a beaver walks by and like steps on you. These guys got killed a lot

209
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,280
 by condors. Now the theory is, is that yes, something is leaving tiny footprints all over

210
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,640
 Oregon, little baby footprints all over Oregon, but it's not a little dude. It's not a little dude

211
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
 shooting out arrows. Remember that? They're arrows, they're poisonous, all that stuff, getting attacked

212
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,040
 by birds. Scientists believe they're actually porcupines because they said that their feet

213
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,560
 look like baby footprints and they have quills, which kind of looks like an arrow, kind of looks

214
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
 like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow.

215
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
 It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow. It's like an arrow.

216
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,800
 But you don't want to get stuck with a quill because maybe that porcupine was rolling around

217
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,920
 in a mef factory and got extra toxic. So scientists say the baby foot tracks that you can actually

218
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,520
 find all over Oregon on baby rock, they say like the feet prints, the footprints are actually in

219
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,000
 the rock itself. It's probably a baby, it's probably a porcupine because the porcupine looks like a

220
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,080
 baby footprint. The problem with that is, I don't know what you guys are thinking, that might be true.

221
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,280
 A porcupine's footprint may look like a baby's footprint, but if you ever met a porcupine

222
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:41,440
 with feet that were 4.5 inches long, that's not a porcupine. That is something out of a balloon

223
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,240
 man's nightmare. Or your nightmares, you don't have to be made of balloons to not want to meet a

224
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,280
 giant quilled creature. 4.5 inches, that's massive for porcupine's foot. Now to be fair,

225
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,680
 I don't know how big porcupines are. I don't know, maybe porcupines are. I've only seen porcupines on

226
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,960
 television. I don't know how big a porcupine is normally, but 4.5 inches seems quite big for

227
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,880
 having the feet. But again, that could just be normal for a porcupine. So is baby foot actually

228
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,480
 a porcupine? Is baby foot, big foot's tiny or cousin who gets eaten, gets eaten all the time by

229
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
 eagles and it can also attack people in bitum and stuff like that? Who knows?

230
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,840
 I definitely don't know how big a porcupine is, but people still believe in this legend and they've

231
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,680
 named places all over Oregon after baby foot. There is actually baby foot tracks spotted in 1992

232
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,960
 up at the Green Point Upper Reservoir, which is nearby where I live. I might actually do

233
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,640
 a live stream, I'm shaking my head, I will never do this, but I think it would be cool to go out

234
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,200
 there and hunt the baby foot. The problem is I'm not an outdoorsman, that's really the only problem.

235
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,160
 I would get lost up there. I would totally get lost up there. And that's actually a great segue for

236
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,880
 our next story. Samson, we're going to give you a little collar with a little carbonar copter key

237
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,160
 around it and you are going to, he's like, dude, you put it in my paw. I'm supposed to fly this thing

238
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,640
 if my neck is in the ignition. Okay, we'll give you another one, that's your memorial key. We're

239
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,120
 going to give you another, I should send out carbonar copter keys to my Patreons. Make some fake

240
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,560
 keys. I don't think about that. Anyway, Samson's, I try not to make money during my episode.

241
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,600
 Samson, he puts in the key to the carbonar copter, we are flying out to England.

242
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:54,000
 Helicopters flying over the Atlantic Ocean, we are going back to the year 1976. It's a beautiful

243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,160
 summer day. This story is from the UFO Experiencer Support Group and I got it from, think about it,

244
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,960
 docs.com, they got it from them, but we don't have an exact day. We don't have the names of these

245
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,600
 kids, but this is a creepy one. We're going to land that carbonar copter in a little English

246
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,080
 Glen. We all hop out, we're dressed all posh, got top hats on, whatever ties they wear over there,

247
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,400
 you know, like the skinny weird ones you see when you watch Call the Midwife, which I don't,

248
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,240
 you might, so you know exactly what I'm talking about. Samson's leading the way, we are walking

249
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,560
 into this English Glen and we see two nine-year-old boys, they're out playing in this Glen, they're

250
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,120
 walking around sticks hitting each other, hunting porcupines, the porcupines' giant, it's chasing

251
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,320
 them away, they're like, "Ah!" They eventually find their way to an old cemetery. They're like,

252
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,840
 "Let's go in here," because we're nine years old and life is full of adventure. It's also 1976

253
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,200
 when people allowed their kids to wander off into the wilderness and they knew they would come back.

254
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,120
 1976, these two nine-year-old boys, let's call them Johnny and Barney, go walking through this old

255
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,360
 cemetery and they see a trench that's dug in the cemetery and they're like, "What in the world?"

256
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,240
 They jump into the trench and they're walking around and that little sense of excitement and

257
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 fear starts willing up in them. They know they shouldn't be in the old cemetery to begin with,

258
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,680
 but they definitely shouldn't be in this trench. I said in the beginning of the episode, this took

259
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,920
 place in a cave, but I was wrong. It took place in a trench. So, forget that. Forget that I said

260
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,920
 that earlier. It's a trench. This is a trench story. So, they're walking through the trench

261
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:41,440
 and they see a black door at the end of the trench. They're like, "What?" "Seem a lot of trenches in my

262
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,120
 life, Barney. I've actually only seen two. This is me in the second one, but I've never seen a

263
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,480
 trench with a door in it. Where would that door even possibly lead? It would have to lead underground."

264
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,040
 They both say at the same time. So, they walk up. Johnny walks up and he starts to turn the knob.

265
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:10,240
 Apparently, the door needs to be greased or it's March 7th. They open the door and they see

266
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,520
 a room in front of them. The first thing that catches their eyes are lit up control panels

267
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,560
 lining the wall. Johnny and Barney kind of look at each other. Computer banks, monitors,

268
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:33,680
 all of these lights flashing on the walls. And then, in front of two of these panels,

269
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:44,800
 there are chairs and sitting in the chairs are aliens. They're pressing buttons.

270
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,960
 They're making electronic music. This is the beginning of dubstep. These aliens

271
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,720
 are interacting with the consoles. Now, these are great aliens. This story takes place in 1976.

272
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,400
 It's interesting because I don't know. First off, I don't think these kids could point out what a

273
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,000
 computer monitor was or a computer, especially in 1976. They're just seeing this advanced

274
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,440
 technology in front of them. It's all green screen dot matrix printer. They're like, "Whoa, dude."

275
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,400
 And even the idea of what a great alien would look like. This would be the first time they

276
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,360
 would see this. There was no communion book. There's no book that scared everyone when it was on

277
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,320
 their parents' shelf. They say that the aliens are interacting with all of these panels and the

278
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,960
 two boys are standing there and something gives away their presence. Because when the aliens turn

279
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,200
 almost simultaneously, the two aliens turn and look at the boys, they're described as the aliens

280
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,720
 look startled. The person telling the story said, "The aliens actually flinched when they saw us."

281
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,920
 Out in the English countryside, in a deep trench, in an old cemetery. Bright summer day,

282
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:02,000
 the aliens did not expect to have visitors. But here there were two nine-year-old boys. The aliens

283
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:12,560
 and right when the aliens flinched, two panels opened up on both sides of the room and out came

284
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,640
 these massive robots. Beep, bop, burp, beep, bop, burp, beep, bop, burp. I don't know if they're

285
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,960
 actually making that noise, but you know, it's theater of the mind. So these two robots are

286
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,440
 walking around, they're massive. Great aliens are normally like four or five feet tall. Nine-year-old

287
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,800
 boys are about four feet tall. These things were huge and they're just these giant robots that are

288
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,920
 walking towards them and they were all silver. The boys said it actually looked like not so much

289
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,520
 like a robot, but it looked like somebody was somebody wearing a robot suit because he said

290
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,520
 as it was moving you could see like the waist crinkle. So it looked like it was metal, but it

291
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,640
 actually would, you know when you're walking with your shirt, with your shirt on and actually crease

292
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,800
 and stuff like that? He goes, "That's what it looked like." He said the thing had tiny little BDIs but

293
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:06,960
 no mouth and it had these massive claws like crab claws. Both of them, beep, bop, burp, clappin',

294
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,040
 they're not doing that. I don't know why they're doing that. They are though snapping their claws

295
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,000
 at these two boys. And within seconds these things are on top of these kids. The claws wrap

296
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,240
 around the boys' waist like a crab grabbing a fish out of the water. Johnny looks at Barney,

297
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,840
 Barney looks at Johnny. They're both in the grips of these robots or people wearing mech suits

298
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:38,640
 and then Johnny wakes up in bed. I know yesterday I did a segment about a guy waking up in bed.

299
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,560
 He was out in the forest. He woke up in bed. So it could have been a dream. However,

300
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,680
 Johnny wakes up out of his bed, crossed the way, Barney wakes out of his bed. They come to meet

301
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,640
 each other and Johnny goes, "Okay, this might have just been a dream, but weren't we just in a

302
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,120
 trench?" And Barney goes with the robots, with the big old claw hands. And Johnny goes, "Yeah."

303
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,120
 So there's no way they both had the same dream at the same time. It's funny because it validates

304
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,400
 yesterday's story. These two kids were captured. They have no idea what happened after they were

305
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,880
 captured. They said it was summer. It was a nice summer day. They're out in the old cemetery. The

306
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,360
 next thing they know, they're basically crashing an alien's party pad. They get clawed, get big old

307
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,920
 claws wrapped around them, and then they both are dropped off in their bedrooms asleep. It's a terrifying

308
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:37,040
 story. It definitely has like a happy ending, right? These kids don't get chopped up. They don't get

309
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,240
 thrown into alien gladiator prison and stuff like that. That would actually be kind of dope, but

310
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,680
 you know, they live. They are back at home. These type of stories always make you wonder.

311
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,360
 What about the people who don't make it home? We always hear the war stories about the soldiers

312
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,200
 who are fighting in the last man because somebody is there, the second to last man, is there to tell

313
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,920
 that story. Or the winning army goes in and they see the aftermath of the battle and they can take

314
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,200
 an after battle report and things like that. But when people just go missing, there's always that

315
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,400
 question of where did they go? What could have happened? We know about the people who are abducted

316
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,400
 by aliens and then dropped off, but we don't know about the people who are abducted by aliens

317
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:28,640
 and are never seen again. The elderly farmer in Albania who lives miles from town. The loner

318
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,360
 who smokes his last cigarette, leaves the bar. Nobody really got to know that guy.

319
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,000
 Unemployed, stumbles off down the street, never seen again. There's a whole mass of people that

320
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,680
 unfortunately can simply disappear. You would never know about it, especially like with

321
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,680
 prostitutes and things like that. If you think about like hardcore drug users, how at a certain point

322
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,840
 they, their family has dismissed them and society has dismissed them and they, they run the track.

323
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,200
 That's the term where you go from California to Washington and back. That's a prostitution term.

324
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,600
 You get to recognized in one city by the local police. You move on to the next one,

325
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,680
 you go up and down the track. They're very transient and even, and homeless people obviously

326
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,720
 are incredibly transient. If they disappeared, if they were walking through these tunnels,

327
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,960
 if they were getting abducted by aliens, you would never know because they're already off the grid.

328
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,800
 So when everything people get dropped back off at home, it does make me think,

329
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,400
 these are the people who get dropped back off at home. What happens to the people who don't?

330
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 What are their stories? Where are they? Kind of a creepy story. And it's also creepy because

331
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,360
 generally we've talked about this a lot on the show. There's that idea that aliens abduct people

332
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,480
 because they're chosen to be abducted, either for a medical reason or a psychological reason.

333
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,240
 These kids weren't chosen. These kids were just bumbling into a secret UFO base.

334
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:07,680
 Got attacked by robots. It's really hard to avoid alien contact if they're everywhere.

335
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,240
 If you can literally just open a door and find two gray aliens busy at work.

336
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,680
 So the next time you're driving down that dark road and you see a turnoff

337
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
 that you've never driven down before, just keep driving.

338
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,480
 Or if you walk into your house and you notice that's weird,

339
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,920
 my kitchen used to not have a black door behind the fridge.

340
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:43,600
 Just ignore it or move or move because that door you opened, that trail you walked down

341
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,840
 that you never walked down before, sure it could lead to adventure that reminds you of

342
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,480
 what it was like to be a child. Trapscene through the English countryside when you were 9 years old,

343
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,840
 sure it could do that. But it could also lead you right into the cold metal grasp

344
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,480
 of an alien robot. And you may become one of those people that we never get to hear the

345
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,800
 ending of their story. You may not end up waking up and wondering was it all a dream.

346
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,080
 You may find yourself trapped in a cage, naked, covered in slime, in a pitch black room somewhere

347
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,560
 deep within an alien starship. And thinking every moment, "I wish I could wake up.

348
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,320
 This has to be a dream. It's just a dream. Please wake up."

349
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:43,280
 That was a pretty sad ending, but Samson, we love you, everyone here at Dead Rabbit Radio loves you.

350
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,440
 You know that all the fans were giving him pets. I'm going to play a song from Sundiver,

351
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,360
 one of my favorite bands, the best local band here in town. This is an amazing song I consider

352
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,080
 a modern lullaby. And let's go ahead and listen to this. This song is dedicated to you Samson,

353
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,160
 this song is dedicated to you Sean. You'll see him again. He will be waiting for you.

354
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,760
 You're a good boy Samson. You're a good boy.

 Where the air is crisp and clear

358
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,760
 A set of float all of these wonders

359
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 Caress the textures of our years

361

 I want to love you like the moon loves the stars

 When all our origami constructs

363
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 Have all the creases I am fly

364
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 When all our hopes, our dreams, our inspirations, our motivations

365
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:01,760
 Are left to wither at our backs

366
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,760

 There's an ever-flowing stream

372

 The mist that mandate breathes just wash yourself and cleanse yourself

373

 Wash on this river and be clean
