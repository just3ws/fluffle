1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains content that is highly disturbing.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,880
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,680
 When a woman is rushed to an emergency room with a life-threatening illness, we are forced

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,320
 to ask the question, "Was this a tragic accident?" or "Was it a fetish?"

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,280
 Did this woman want this thing to happen?

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,760
 This is such a weird story.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,120
 And then we travel to Indonesia to take a look at a serial killer with the most bizarre

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,760
 of motives.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,240
 Some serial killers stalk their prey to have a sense of power, while others take multiple

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,400
 lives for some sort of bizarre sexual satisfaction.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,920
 But today we're going to meet a man known as the Sorcerer, whose sole motivation for

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,640
 killing women was that he was incredibly lazy.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,760
 And today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,560
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,160
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,280
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
 The first story is probably gonna be soon in court.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,440
 So let's just get the lawsuit over with walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now as one

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,280
 of our newest Patreon supporters and my co-defendant.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,600
 Everyone give it up for Flashman7870.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
 Woohoo!

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
 Yeah!

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 Come on in, Flashman.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 He's on my coming in.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,360
 He's like, "I don't want to be part of the lawsuit episode."

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
 Flashman, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,440
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,680
 I do.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
 Just helps spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,080
 Now Flashman, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, drive us all the way out to the United Kingdom.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,760
 [imitates gunshot]

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,120
 Nice leisurely drive over the crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,800
 We're headed out to the United Kingdom specifically.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,960
 We're headed to the town of Bristol.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,120
 The year is 2022.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
 We don't have a specific month, but it's weird.

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,520
 We don't have a specific month, but we have every other piece of evidence available.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,680
 And I think another story is true.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:34,000
 And when I was reading the story, I thought, "Who would possibly allow a newspaper to report

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,760
 on this story?"

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,840
 Not only using her full name, but multiple photographs clearly showing her face.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,320
 I was like, "Something is up.

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 Something is up."

47
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,560
 Allegedly, something is up.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 I have no proof.

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,800
 Then we know the story is true.

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,120
 Let's go ahead and get started with the story and we'll delve into it a little bit more.

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,160
 And you'll be given that Fast Forward button ready, guys.

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,680
 It's the year 2022.

53
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
 It's a sunny afternoon in Bristol.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 And there's a woman.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,120
 Her name is Amanda Gomo.

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 Amanda Gomo.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
 She's 51 years old.

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,320
 She is a mother of three.

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,920
 And she's the proud owner of Belle, the Chihuahua.

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,240
 Little Belle's walking around the house.

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,760
 The kids are waving, "Hey, mom.

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,640
 They're jumping for each other in the house.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 They always wave.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
 Bye, mom."

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
 And she walks down the hallway.

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,520
 "Amanda, you know it's been a long day for Amanda."

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,040
 She decides to take a nap.

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,480
 So she crawls into bed.

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,320
 And little Belle gets into bed with her.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 And walking around in circles doing the things dogs do.

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,680
 Amanda falls asleep.

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,400
 Now this was reported in the media.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,680
 I have to keep hammering this home.

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
 If this happened to me, nobody would ever know.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 Ever, right?

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,120
 Maybe in some medical journal it would pop up where they legally can't use my name.

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,080
 But Amanda has no problem with her name being used in association with this story.

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,000
 Again, multiple photographs of her in this as well.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,480
 This was published in the Wales Online newspaper.

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,320
 Amanda has a habit of sleeping with her mouth open.

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
 And she's having a good nap.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
 She is dead to the world.

83
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
 She is so asleep.

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,480
 But her mouth is wide open.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:35,320
 However, her sleep is horribly interrupted when all of a sudden she feels a squirt into

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 her mouth.

87
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:45,800
 I feel like I have to keep disassembling this story.

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,040
 Because they didn't let's put yourself in the story.

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
 I'm not putting myself in the story.

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,000
 Let's put you into the story.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
 Imagine you were dead asleep.

92
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,520
 Imagine you were totally asleep.

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,000
 And all of a sudden your mouth was filled with something.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,360
 And again, it would be one thing if I was asleep and my mouth was wide open and one

95
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
 of my roommates put like shaving cream in my mouth.

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
 I think that's toxic.

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,560
 They put a scoop of ice cream in my mouth, right?

98
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
 They put some Jello in my mouth.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 Like that would still be disturbing.

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,080
 And that fight is still going to break out.

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,320
 But imagine a squirt into your mouth.

102
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 You're dead asleep.

103
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,200
 And then all of a sudden, like the velocity, like everything that's added into it.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,800
 It's not just like a fly landed on her mouth.

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
 It's nothing like that.

106
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 It's squirts.

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,840
 You're adding all these other physics into it.

108
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,200
 There's splash back.

109
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,780
 There's the initial force.

110
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,080
 This wakes Amanda up.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
 This wakes Amanda up because something squirted into her open mouth.

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 And then she very, very quickly realizes what has happened.

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,560
 Her dog, Belle, who was sick, who was not feeling well, but she said, "Hey, Belle, come and lay

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
 in bed with me."

115
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,920
 As Amanda is sleeping there with her mouth open, Belle diaries into Amanda's mouth.

116
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,000
 It is a thick, straight out of a toxinus.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,120
 You're like, Jason, there better be a conspiracy or a ghost showing up in this story because

118
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
 otherwise, why are you telling this?

119
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,360
 So anyway, there is a conspiracy.

120
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,200
 I have a conspiracy about it.

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,680
 This little Chihuahua, she's lucky it's a Chihuahua, right?

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,720
 She's like, "My great Dane loved to sleep in bed with me.

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,000
 A Chihuahua diary is right into Amanda's mouth."

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,360
 And what would you do in this situation?

125
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,880
 Again, you'd get out of bed.

126
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 You'd be like, "Oh, I'm so tired.

127
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
 I'm going to continue my nap.

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,200
 I'll deal with this later."

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,680
 She jumps out of bed and she runs to the bathroom to wash her mouth out.

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
 Yeah, totally on board with you, Amanda.

131
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
 That's what I would have done too.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
 However, she gets to the door, "Open up!

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
 Blimey!

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,720
 I got some poop in my mouth."

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
 And she's knocking on the door.

136
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,400
 Her son is in there taking a shower.

137
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,560
 So what would you do in this situation?

138
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,320
 I live in a modern place where there's multiple faucets, right?

139
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
 She does too.

140
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,480
 I don't think her sink, I don't think her kitchen's in her bathroom.

141
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,480
 But instead of running to, maybe they have an extra bathroom, but they definitely have

142
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,520
 like a kitchen sink, if that fails, someone's washing the dishes.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
 They're like, "Sorry, Ma.

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,280
 I need to go poop in your mouth, but I got to finish these dishes."

145
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,680
 You go outside, you get a hose.

146
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,360
 You go to a neighbor's house, maybe.

147
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,640
 A dog just had violent diarrhea straight into your open mouth.

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,360
 Amanda, when she knocks on the door and her son goes, "Mom, taking a shower, I would

149
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
 have kicked down that door.

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,200
 I'd be like, I don't care, son, I've seen everything you've got.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,280
 I'm going to wash my mouth out in your sink.

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
 You can stay in the shower."

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:11,200
 She takes a selfie of herself, which she also sent to the news.

154
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:18,640
 There is a photograph of her with dog poop all over her face.

155
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,760
 So not only has she allowed the media to use her real name, she's allowed them to use a

156
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,880
 photograph of her with dog poop all over her face.

157
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 Liquid dog poop, right, diarrhea.

158
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,280
 I'm like, "That's any better or worse."

159
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,040
 I was like, "Oh, it's dry dog poop.

160
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
 That's fine.

161
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
 Those pictures can go out."

162
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,080
 I'm assuming she posted these on Facebook and stuff like that as well, which just, again,

163
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
 begs the question.

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
 Don't.

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 It's not even a question.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 It's a statement.

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 Leave.

168
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 Go.

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
 Go to another sink.

170
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,560
 At no point in this story would I go, "Oh, you know what?

171
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,280
 I'm going to take a picture of this.

172
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,960
 Ever."

173
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,960
 She takes a picture of herself with dog feces all over her face.

174
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,400
 Looks like someone just threw a can of baked beans on her.

175
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 And then she apparently waits until her son gets out of the bathroom.

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,760
 Like, I don't know what type of backwater city Bristol is, but maybe that is where the

177
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,880
 kitchen is, is in the bathroom.

178
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,480
 Eventually though, she does clean her face off.

179
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,080
 And she said, "I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth.

180
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
 It went on for hours.

181
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 I was vomiting.

182
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,880
 I couldn't get rid of this sensation."

183
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,400
 Well, a couple days later, Belle is still sick.

184
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,920
 The little toawa is still sick.

185
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,560
 The fact that this dog is still alive, by the way, the fact that this dog wasn't immediately

186
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,440
 strangled is, again, very shocking to me.

187
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,720
 I would have just been like, "Listen, Belle, you're no longer part of the family.

188
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,920
 I hope you can survive in the wilderness.

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
 You're not welcome here anymore."

190
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
 Um, no, but Belle was still there.

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
 Belle was sick, obviously.

192
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
 And then they took Belle to the vet.

193
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,600
 And they said, "Yeah, Belle has some sort of gastrointestinal disorder, I feel like

194
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 you think?

195
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 It pooped in my mouth."

196
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:10,680
 Well, anyways, later that day, after Belle had been diagnosed with this stomach disease,

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,320
 Amanda also begins to get sick.

198
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,560
 She says her whole body starts cramping up.

199
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 She begins to have violent diarrhea.

200
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 She's walking out the house.

201
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
 She's like, "Ooh, which one of my kids are asleep?

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
 I got a surprise for them.

203
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
 I'll pass on the curse.

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,040
 It's like the ring video."

205
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,020
 She begins to have violent diarrhea.

206
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,400
 Her whole body starts cramping up.

207
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,920
 She goes to the hospital.

208
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,200
 Sure enough, she has the same gastrointestinal bug that Belle has.

209
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
 Sure the doctors are wondering, "How did you get a dog disease?"

210
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,440
 And they're taking bets on how weird this woman can be to get this dog disease.

211
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,480
 And they're like, "Oh, man, no one bet that you let a dog diarrhea in your mouth."

212
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,080
 She's in the hospital for three days.

213
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,200
 They have to, like, replenish her fluids and all that stuff.

214
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,720
 They're finally able to cure the infection.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,680
 And then Amanda ends this article in the walesonline.com or .co.uk.

216
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,040
 They said, "I've forgiven Belle."

217
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,960
 That would have, I never would have, but, "I've forgiven Belle and her little accident,

218
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,560
 and I still love her with all my heart.

219
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,600
 But I will definitely be more mindful of what position we sleep in the future."

220
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,520
 Like separate rooms for me, right?

221
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,400
 I would have gotten rid of the dog.

222
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,600
 I would have gotten rid of my firstborn child if he moved to my mouth.

223
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 I'm like, "You're gone.

224
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,400
 Hope you like Grewl, 'cause you headed to the orphanage."

225
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,120
 So that's the story of Amanda and her dog Belle.

226
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,240
 But here's my conspiracy theory for this.

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,160
 Here's my conspiracy theory for this.

228
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
 This, I have no proof of any of this.

229
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,880
 I have no proof of any of this, your honor, as I'm being held in libel court in Bretton.

230
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,120
 I don't know if any of this is true.

231
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,920
 But I will say, let's take a look at some of the evidence here.

232
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,640
 To me, actually let's do this.

233
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
 Forget that story, forget that story.

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,440
 I'm gonna talk about a hypothetical person named, "Samanda."

235
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:18,360
 And Samanda, to me, it's so weird to think that you would let a dog poop in your mouth.

236
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,480
 I'm pausing so the other lawyer can say, "Objection, objection."

237
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,360
 She never let the dog poop in her mouth.

238
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,560
 Here's my thing.

239
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,200
 Poobs in your mouth.

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,600
 What would you do?

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,960
 You'd wash it out and then you would never tell anyone ever again what happened.

242
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,360
 The end.

243
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,160
 I'm wondering, and I have no facts to back this up, I'm wondering if this is some bizarre

244
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,480
 fetish.

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,240
 Like some bizarre humiliation fetish that this person has.

246
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,600
 This hypothetical person has.

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,480
 Because not only did she get poop in her mouth, she then did not wash it out immediately.

248
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,960
 She took a photo that was then posted online.

249
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,000
 You took a photo of her in the hospital room and a photo of her kissing her dog.

250
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I'm just saying, it looks extremely suspicious.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,800
 If someone sent you a photograph of poop, if you took a photograph from a long lost friend

252
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 and you haven't seen them in a while and they have poop on their face, would you assume

253
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,680
 that they wanted you to see that photo?

254
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,480
 Obviously they sent it to you.

255
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
 If somebody sent me a photograph of them covered in feces, I would assume this is some sort

256
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
 of disgusting fetish they have.

257
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,360
 They're roping me in on it.

258
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 I think that's what's...

259
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,680
 Again, I gotta be very careful what I say, but I'm wondering if that's what this is.

260
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,040
 I'm wondering if this is some sort of humiliation fetish or some sort of scat fetish.

261
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,240
 And this is the way that somebody could get off by putting this stuff out there.

262
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,040
 Dog poops in your mouth, wash it out, go to the doctor.

263
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
 End the story.

264
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
 No one should know your name.

265
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,520
 No one should see photos of it.

266
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,280
 The fact that you would stop at any point in time and snap a photo of dog diarrhea on

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,640
 your face is just weird.

268
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,920
 It's just weird.

269
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,120
 If it's not a fetish, it's definitely weird, your honor.

270
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,920
 I think I've clearly not...

271
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,160
 I don't think I've specifically said I think she has some sick old fetish, but she may.

272
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
 I rest my case.

273
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
 I don't know.

274
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
 I don't know.

275
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
 Has it been dragged off?

276
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
 Has it been dragged off?

277
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
 I haven't thrown in British jail.

278
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,400
 Who knows, right?

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,760
 It's definitely a true prime story for the ages.

280
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,280
 Okay, let's go ahead.

281
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
 I just...

282
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,840
 This story is so disgusting I had to share it with you guys.

283
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,440
 Flashman7870, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonic optor.

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,960
 You might want to wash those keys off as you're catching them.

285
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,880
 You're like, "Ah, let's leave behind Bristol, the United Kingdom.

286
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,720
 Take us all the way out to Indonesia."

287
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,880
 I've always felt bad for people who have weird fetishes like that.

288
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,240
 Like, how do you have a normal relationship if you like getting pooped on by a dog?

289
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,800
 How do you even build bonds with other...

290
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,480
 I mean, you can be good friends with people, but you get married and he's like, "Hey, honey,

291
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 you want a snuggled toy?"

292
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,320
 She's looking over at the Chihuahua and she's like, "Oh, I wish."

293
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,760
 He's like, "What'd you say, honey?

294
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 Oh, nothing."

295
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,680
 Like, if you had a fetish like that, how do you even relate?

296
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,600
 You see all the other wives in town are like, "Oh, and then I bought this sexy lingerie

297
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,520
 and my husband, oh, he took me like a wild animal."

298
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 She's like, "Did that wild animal have diarrhea?"

299
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
 Amanda.

300
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,280
 I mean, Samantha, what are you talking about?

301
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,000
 Okay, anyways, anyways, let's move on.

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,520
 We are in Indonesia, specifically we're in the town of Medan.

303
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,360
 That's in North Sumatra, Indonesia.

304
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,000
 It's kind of a rural part of the country.

305
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,080
 It's a place where stories of witchcraft, black magic, shamanism, these are still held

306
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,360
 in very high regard in these more rural regions of Indonesia.

307
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,800
 We're back in the year 1986.

308
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,920
 We're going to head out to this cattle breeding facility.

309
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,040
 Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, it's not what you think, it's not what you think.

310
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,360
 We head out to this cattle breeding facility and we're going to meet a worker there.

311
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,240
 His name is Amad Sirajee.

312
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,600
 Amad Sirajee, he's 37 years old and he's like, "You cows, go do your thing.

313
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
 Go do bulls over there.

314
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
 Yeah, come in.

315
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
 Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."

316
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,560
 I don't know if he was that into it.

317
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,080
 It might have just been a day job for him.

318
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,360
 Actually, I know it was a part-time job because his other part-time job was as a duke-un, which

319
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,760
 is a shaman.

320
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,760
 Shaman who specializes in minor charms, curses, stuff like that.

321
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,200
 Most of his clientele were women and they'd come to him and they'd ask for a beauty spell.

322
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,880
 They're getting a little bit older, something to take care of their crow's feet.

323
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,800
 Maybe it was something that they wanted to get lucky and find the right man.

324
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,640
 Sometimes it was just for wealth.

325
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
 Sometimes though, it was a little bit darker.

326
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,200
 They wanted a cheating husband to get what he deserved or an ex-boyfriend to realize

327
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,480
 she was the right one all along and then probably fall on a couple mud puddles along the way.

328
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,280
 He had no problem doing any of this stuff, but like us all, a mod aspired for greater

329
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
 things.

330
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:50,680
 Well, one night in 1986, he has a dream.

331
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,040
 He sees his father materialize in front of him in the dreamscape.

332
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,200
 His father who's deceased in the real world is now standing there in front of him while

333
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
 he slumbers.

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,080
 And his father tells a mod, "Listen, there is a way that you can have more power than

335
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
 any mortal man.

336
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,160
 There is a ritual you can perform where you can become the great mystical healer you were

337
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,080
 always meant to be.

338
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:34,500
 What you need to do is find a dead woman and drink the saliva from her lips.

339
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:46,720
 If you do this 70 times, you will gain all the powers you ever wanted."

340
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
 So when a mod wakes up, it thinks about that.

341
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,000
 I mean, obviously my father coming to me in this dream, it's not just a dream, it's a

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 vision.

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,040
 He's telling me something from the other world, from the beyond.

344
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,920
 A way to become a mighty mystic.

345
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,880
 But I have to drink the saliva from the mouths of 70 dead young women.

346
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,120
 Sounds like a lot of work.

347
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,200
 I mean, obviously when a woman dies and go to her grave and dig her up, you get the

348
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
 saliva.

349
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,600
 But there's a lot of labor involved in that, right?

350
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
 There's a lot of labor involved in that.

351
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I gotta dig it up.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,520
 First off, I gotta find out where they're buried.

353
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,160
 I have to be watching the news and find out when a young woman dies and maybe, what, how

354
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,640
 many young women die in this region in a given week or a given month?

355
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,160
 Probably not a lot, right?

356
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,680
 Gotta wait till they're buried, dig them up, drink the saliva.

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,960
 But if I do this, I'll be more powerful than I could ever imagine.

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,480
 So the end result is what I want.

359
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,640
 The problem is it's going to take so long and it's going to be so much work to drink

360
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,000
 the saliva of these dead women.

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Just backbreaking manual labor, researching death notices, all of this stuff.

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,240
 Labor has to be an easier way.

363
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:25,040
 And when Amad finally puts two and two together, what he needs is the saliva and what he has

364
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,520
 is an unending stream of women coming to him for help.

365
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,520
 He figures out the solution to all of his problems.

366
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,480
 Now Amad went by many names.

367
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,600
 He was known as Amad to some.

368
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:51,120
 He was also known as Nasib Kliwang or Datuk Marengi and also he was known as the Sorcerer.

369
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,960
 Now these names weren't just like Tupac's also known as Machiavelli.

370
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,640
 These names allowed him to make contact with women.

371
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,000
 The women come out to see him.

372
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 The women disappear.

373
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,640
 It's not getting tracked back to Amad.

374
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,040
 Even if they were able to connect that the last person she saw was Nasib or Datuk or

375
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:22,840
 the Sorcerer, is that actually coming back to Amad's home.

376
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,920
 What's interesting is that the last victim of Amad, when she got picked up by a 15 year

377
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,680
 old rickshaw driver, she told the driver don't tell anyone where you're taking me.

378
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,480
 Okay, you know, you pay me my money, I'll take you wherever you want.

379
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:49,400
 And he took her out to this house near a giant sugar cane field, dropped her off, left.

380
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,800
 And he never heard back from her.

381
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,120
 He never heard back from this woman, but when he started seeing news reports and when investigators

382
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:03,560
 started walking around looking for this woman, the rickshaw driver goes to the police and

383
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,320
 say, Hey, I think I know who you're looking for.

384
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,760
 Like I gave this woman a ride out to this house where the sugar cane field and she told

385
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:18,320
 me not to tell anybody, but obviously if she's missing, I'm going to tell you, right?

386
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,920
 That happened in April of 1997, when the police finally showed up at Amad's house.

387
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,680
 In 1997.

388
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,920
 The dream was in 1986.

389
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,880
 So for 11 years, the sorcerer was putting his plan into action.

390
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,520
 He'd be sitting at his house and he'd have a young woman show up asking for a simple

391
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,160
 charm to be cast.

392
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,240
 She'd gladly pay him for it.

393
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,480
 And he would take the money.

394
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,200
 He would look at her, think about it.

395
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,680
 Yeah.

396
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
 She's young enough.

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,640
 She'll do.

398
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,640
 And he would lead this young woman out into the sugar cane field where there would be

399
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,280
 this little pit dug.

400
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
 Now it wasn't very wide.

401
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,800
 It wasn't super deep, but it was deep enough for the woman to get into.

402
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,160
 And she would get into it up to her waist.

403
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,860
 And he goes, this is all part of the ritual.

404
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,800
 You want to be beautiful?

405
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,640
 This is what we do.

406
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,120
 This will be a beauty spell.

407
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,840
 This is part of it.

408
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 And she's meeting this shaman, right?

409
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,760
 This man who has a reputation for being able to cast these charms and these curses and

410
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 such.

411
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 I'll get into the little pit.

412
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,960
 And the woman would get into the pit and it would go up to her waist and then he would

413
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,760
 sit there and fill it full of dirt and kind of pack it down so she's just kind of buried,

414
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,520
 almost like a plant, just sticking up out of the dirt.

415
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:05,400
 He'd wrap his hands around her neck and squeeze the life out of her.

416
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:17,200
 Right when she died, he would lean down and suck the saliva out of her mouth.

417
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,440
 He would dig them up, take all their clothes off to aid in the decomposition.

418
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,240
 Then he would dig a properly sized grave, place the body in it, always make sure the

419
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,920
 head was facing towards his house, which was nearby the sugarcane field.

420
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:44,760
 Pack the dirt down, walk back home.

421
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,600
 When the police showed up at his house, they don't know any of that.

422
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,440
 They just are looking for this missing woman.

423
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,000
 They start to grill him on, "Hey, do you know where this woman went?

424
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Do you know where this woman went?"

425
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And he totally denies it.

426
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I don't know who you're talking about.

427
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yeah, I am a mystic.

428
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,160
 I get a lot of people who come through here.

429
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,120
 A lot of people of different ages.

430
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,640
 So it's not that everyone who stopped by his house ended up dead.

431
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,520
 Some of them did.

432
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,000
 The young ones.

433
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,760
 But even not all of them, it would be luck of the draw.

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,720
 Whether or not you would come in, get a little remedy for what was ailing you and leave,

435
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,360
 or if you would come in and he would go, "I have the ritual for you.

436
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,880
 Let's go out to the sugarcane field."

437
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,440
 He's denying that he even knows this woman, but the police see some of her items, some

438
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
 of her personal items.

439
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,160
 They see her purse in his house.

440
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
 So you can't, you know what you're gonna do.

441
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
 You're caught.

442
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,000
 You just said you didn't even know who this person was.

443
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,320
 How do you have her purse sitting there?

444
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,760
 So a mod finally breaks down and confesses.

445
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,640
 I've been taking them out to the sugarcane field.

446
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,760
 So when the police finally go out there and they start digging up the sugarcane field,

447
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
 they find 42 bodies.

448
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:22,360
 42 bodies of young women, all nude, all buried so their head is facing towards his house.

449
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,240
 And some of them were so decomposed they have no idea who these people were.

450
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,640
 Now a mod was arrested.

451
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,600
 He was arrested on the cops obviously didn't go back and say, "Okay, that's kind of creepy.

452
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 We'll let you go."

453
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 They arrest him.

454
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
 They also arrest, he had three wives with him.

455
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,880
 And they arrest the three wives.

456
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,000
 They say, "You must have been helping them with this."

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,280
 In the end, only one of the wives was actually found guilty.

458
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,360
 I think two of them were just because the charges were dropped.

459
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
 One of his wives, they were all sisters.

460
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,600
 All three of these wives were sisters.

461
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
 One of the wives is serving life in prison.

462
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,160
 As far as I can tell she's still in there.

463
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,680
 But a mod himself was sentenced to death.

464
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,720
 It was July 10th, 2008 when he was killed by a firing squad.

465
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,760
 Three bullets through his chest.

466
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,160
 It's a super interesting story on multiple levels obviously from a true crime angle.

467
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,200
 And then we also have this paranormal angle where the father tells him to do this.

468
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
 And it's so interesting because when he was being talked to by the police, he was very,

469
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
 very clear.

470
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,840
 My father never told me to kill anybody.

471
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,400
 Even though his father had passed on, even though this was his father's ghosty son or

472
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,040
 dream, he didn't want to besmirch the legacy of his father.

473
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,280
 I mean he kind of did by murdering a bunch of people.

474
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,240
 But he goes, "My dad, I want to be very clear.

475
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,120
 My father did not tell me to murder anybody."

476
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,600
 That was not his intent.

477
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,560
 He said, "My father did not specifically advise me to kill people, so I was thinking it would

478
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,040
 take ages if I have to wait to get 70 women.

479
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,800
 I was trying to get to it as fast as possible.

480
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,640
 I took my own initiative to kill."

481
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
 So I find that idea interesting.

482
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,240
 I mean again, no jury is going to be like, "Well, you know, his dad did tell him to kill

483
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,680
 these people, so you're innocent."

484
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,920
 It wanted to hurt him if he had said, "Well, actually he could have helped him, right?

485
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,880
 He could have said that could have been insanity or something like that or his spirit, some

486
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,200
 demon was impersonating his father, something like that.

487
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
 This guy's obviously insane."

488
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,200
 He still, even though his father was dead, did not want to drag his dad.

489
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,160
 Didn't want to drag his dead dad's ghost into this.

490
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,400
 And say, "My dad, no, he commanded me to kill."

491
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,520
 He goes, "No, my father never told me to do that.

492
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:57,960
 He just gave me a task that was so hard to complete, I wanted to speed things up."

493
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,760
 And he was more than halfway there.

494
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,680
 I mean, I'm not happy to say that like it actually would have worked.

495
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,640
 Actually you know, let's back up for a second because on a paranormal level, let's put on

496
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,960
 our conspiracy caps here.

497
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,120
 This is for my upcoming criminal trial.

498
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,620
 What if this would work?

499
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:27,320
 What if there are spells like this that can work that people have done and it involves

500
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,360
 yes, collecting this, yes, your honor, of collecting this live of 70 dead women, not

501
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,200
 to go out and murder people?

502
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,440
 Because that would have taken a long time.

503
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,320
 What if a spell like this works?

504
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,920
 Like what if there are people out there who have done this successfully, not the murder

505
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,320
 part, but they've spent years, maybe if you're rich enough and you could like fly a plane

506
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,520
 and you're sitting there, you're reading this paper, you're like, "Jervis, take us to Arizona."

507
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,640
 A young woman just died there.

508
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 And then your plane lands and you have your butlers dig up the grave.

509
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,240
 And then you're like, "Ah, sweet, sweet nectar of the gods."

510
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,520
 Butters are like, "Man, we just need to quit."

511
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,760
 Also butlers don't dig graves, dig up graves.

512
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,920
 And then you watch your boss crawl into a grave and be like, "Mmm, suckin' it up."

513
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,480
 Like what if you actually could drink the saliva of 70 dead women?

514
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,480
 I guess my question is what would happen to you?

515
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
 What would happen to you?

516
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,480
 Is it possible that you would get magical powers?

517
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,720
 Is it possible that the dream was real?

518
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,920
 And the dad was trying to give him good advice.

519
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:42,280
 "Son, you're a cool shaman, but you're not so cool that you can quit your job at the

520
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
 cow breeding factory."

521
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,320
 He obviously wasn't doing that good to begin with.

522
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,000
 If you also had to watch cows have sex all day long, he's like, "Oh man, another day,

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 another dollar."

524
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,680
 And then he's like, "Oh, I forgot I'm also a shaman."

525
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,600
 Then he has to go and listen to women's problems.

526
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 He's talking about stuff.

527
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,240
 He's like, "Listen, lady, you think you got it hard?

528
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,720
 I watched a bull have sex with 10 cows today."

529
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,760
 Here, this is a little spell to make you more beautiful.

530
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
 The dad was trying to give him good advice.

531
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,360
 I wonder if this spell works.

532
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,800
 I wonder if there's anything too, if you drink the saliva of 70 dead women, that it would

533
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
 give you magical powers.

534
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
 Like, who am I to say that it won't?

535
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,520
 We talk about crazy stuff all the time.

536
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,600
 I do believe that there are rituals.

537
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
 I do believe in magic in various forms.

538
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 Right?

539
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,440
 So, who's to say that this spell wouldn't work?

540
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,600
 If you did it right, like, had this guy, he was 37, when this all started, had he wandered

541
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 around the countryside, digging...

542
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,440
 I'm not okay, just so we're clear.

543
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,800
 I'm not saying that it's morally right to dig up the graves of young women.

544
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,320
 I'm not saying, like, "Well, the injustice of means."

545
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,200
 But it's better than murdering them.

546
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,360
 I think we can all agree on that, right?

547
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,840
 If it's much better to dig up the corpse of a young woman, of a freshly killed, or freshly

548
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
 dead, right?

549
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,160
 Maybe she just had some disease, right?

550
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,240
 Maybe a dog pooped in her mouth and she didn't go to the hospital in time.

551
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,240
 She dies.

552
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,760
 First off, don't drink her saliva.

553
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,800
 You're like, "Oh, this is so gross."

554
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 Don't do that.

555
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,080
 But, I mean, like, morally speaking, it's much better to drink the saliva of a dead woman

556
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,600
 who you didn't kill.

557
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,920
 I think we can all agree on that.

558
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
 I think we can all agree on that.

559
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,400
 I wonder if this spell works.

560
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
 Let me backtrack.

561
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,920
 I wonder if this spell works.

562
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,240
 I'm not gonna try it myself.

563
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
 I'm not gonna start digging up graves.

564
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,720
 I-I-I-I just-but I'm just curious.

565
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,840
 It's an interesting story from a true crime angle.

566
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,480
 It's very rare you come across a serial killer who's just kind of lazy.

567
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,480
 I mean, you figure you have to kind of be a go-getter.

568
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,080
 You kind of have to be-you can't really be a serial killer and a procrastinator.

569
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,040
 So that's an interesting angle for it.

570
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,520
 Of course, his MAIN motivation, you could say, was to get this power, but the serial

571
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,280
 killing had nothing to do with that.

572
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,320
 It was just a shortcut to get this power.

573
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,360
 And had he gotten all 70 victims, had he drank and all of this saliva, who knows what would

574
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
 happen?

575
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,360
 You're like, "Jason, you just went into-you went into the pachail!

576
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,080
 You just had 70 victims instead of 42!"

577
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,720
 Who knows?

578
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,560
 If you knew for a fact, just like when you're bouncing a basketball, it'll bounce back up

579
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,800
 to you.

580
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,360
 If you knew for a scientific fact, if you drank the saliva of 70 dead women, would you

581
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
 do it?

582
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,160
 Well, I guess I should tell you what happened.

583
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,600
 I go, "You'll get horribly sick!

584
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,640
 You'll get horribly sick and can't look in the mirror at yourself ever again."

585
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,240
 If you knew that if you drank the saliva-you didn't have to kill anybody.

586
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,840
 You just had to travel the country with your army of butlers.

587
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,960
 Would you drink saliva from the mouths of dead women?

588
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,640
 70 of them, by the way, to gain magical powers.

589
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,040
 Like I will not incriminate myself.

590
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,640
 I will not say that I would do it.

591
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,200
 But I mean, that-it would be fascinating.

592
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,400
 It would be a fascinating science experiment for you to do, for you to do.

593
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 Is it possible?

594
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
 Who knows?

595
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:18,000
 And I can imagine, like again, if this is possible, there probably is some like high-end

596
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,640
 shop, some high-end mystical shop outside of Hogwarts.

597
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
 I feel like this is really going sideways.

598
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,840
 I have a totally different idea of what I want, but I'm sure like you could go to some

599
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,120
 like mystical shop and buy a bottle.

600
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,360
 Buy a bottle of the saliva of 70 women, dead women.

601
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
 Like you know what I mean?

602
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
 Jason, I have no idea.

603
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,320
 If you're trying to tell me that Giles from Buffy actually has a shop somewhere where

604
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,560
 you can buy these curios.

605
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,200
 I do think those places exist.

606
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,960
 And I think there are places that tourists go.

607
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,200
 There are places that magical novices go.

608
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,560
 And then there are, just like if I want to buy heroin, I have to go to the local dealer.

609
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,920
 But then there are people who can like go to a heroin den.

610
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,640
 They're like high-end heroin users.

611
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,440
 They know where the good stuff is.

612
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
 No fentanyl in there.

613
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
 You know what I mean?

614
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
 Like there's different levels.

615
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,680
 I'm sure there are like, I've gone to magic shops where you can buy stones and quartz and

616
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
 healing crystals and stuff like that.

617
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,400
 But like a high-level magic user doesn't shop at sparkling creations.

618
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
 Right?

619
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
 They're going somewhere else.

620
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,680
 And they're buying their sage that is freshly harvested from this graveyard or whatever.

621
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,440
 And I'm sure that there are bottles of the saliva of 70 dead women.

622
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,240
 And if there wasn't, there probably is now.

623
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,680
 Like who knows if this is a well-known spell.

624
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,920
 Like this guy could have had a dream.

625
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,360
 But even if someone was just like curiously reading the newspaper, they're like looking

626
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,920
 at a crystal ball one morning.

627
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,640
 They're like, honey, come and see the news.

628
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,760
 Did you hear what's happening?

629
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,080
 And Indonesia little clouds are moving away in the crystal ball.

630
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
 Basically, let me wrap this up.

631
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,760
 I do think, I don't know if it's possible.

632
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,200
 I don't know if it's possible.

633
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,920
 But if it is that this would go from being something that a dream dad told his son to

634
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,360
 then the son publicizing it, because he's killing all these women, it's in the newspaper.

635
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,160
 I can honestly see high level magic users looking at that and going, there might be something

636
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,400
 to this.

637
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
 There might be something to this.

638
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,080
 Like he went about it the wrong way, but let's actually see what happens when you drink the

639
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,760
 saliva of 70 dead young women.

640
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,880
 So somewhere out there today, there may be a little curio shop that doesn't have any

641
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
 yell previews.

642
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,680
 Nobody knows about it unless you're the most elite of all magic users.

643
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,000
 And in that store, there's shelves of goods, right?

644
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,680
 There's like jars of high balls, frogs jumping out of it.

645
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,160
 The cashier is a witch.

646
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
 Okay, nevermind.

647
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,000
 I can't know how serious I tried to end this.

648
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,280
 I realize how ludicrous it sounds.

649
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,200
 What I'm saying is that I'm sure this went from some guy's dream to him trying it, to

650
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,480
 it being publicized in the media to other people actually reading that and going, let's

651
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,480
 see if it'll actually work.

652
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
 Why not?

653
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
 Right?

654
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
 We're a bunch of wizards.

655
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,840
 They're like, "Fly, witch is flying."

656
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,440
 They're flying around graveyards and stuff like that.

657
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,320
 To the point, what I'm getting at is the point is it went from a dream to this guy murdering

658
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,280
 all these women to it being publicized in the media to other people legitimately trying

659
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,180
 it to now in the year 2022.

660
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,000
 You could probably go into one of these elite magic stores and they may have jarred for

661
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 your ease, right?

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,960
 So you don't have to travel all these graveyards.

663
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,760
 A jar of the saliva of 70 dead women, like you can actually just like you have a shopping

664
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
 list.

665
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
 Your butler's like, "Oh, I need a new job."

666
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
 He's like going into this spooky shop.
