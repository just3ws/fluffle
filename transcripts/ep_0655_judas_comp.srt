1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
 Are children really the future of mankind or telepathic freaks ready to expose our secrets?

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,900
 And then we attend a real-life exorcism to take a look at a story of a Monsignor

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,000
 who had been expelling demons left and right a professional exorcist who's traveled around the world

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,600
 But his biggest challenge ever

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,200
 Sending a human soul back to hell that soul

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,420

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,420
 We're gonna give you some gloves and some boots

 Now you're just a silly puddle of milk with there's boots and gloves there and we're gonna shovel you in

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,740
 We're gonna put you in buckets and just put the bucket in the Dead Rabbit Robo

19
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,300
 Everyone grab an ore we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out - I didn't think this one out

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,020
 There's no water where we're going to we circle around America and we end up in a small town in suburban America

21
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,960
 We're gonna crash this party with so over like who wants free milk look at mochi's like no no don't drink me don't drink

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,760
 Who wants free milk?

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,440
 There's this dude named Mike. It's his birthday party and he's sitting there and he's an adult

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,580
 He's like in his 20s and he's like has a little birthday

25
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:13,600
 Still likes birthday hats and he has the pinata and balloons and everything he's sitting there and his five-year-old niece

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:21,280
 Natalie walks up and goes hi uncle Mike. I love you so much. I drew a picture of you

27
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,540
 And he's like the cheapskate. That's the only gift you can get come on

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,820
 I know you get allowance good she shows him the picture and the pictures in the show notes

29
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,320
 But I'll describe it to you because some of you are driving you guys are trying to look it up

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,400
 Cars are sliding everywhere. You hit a giant puddle of milk. It's a picture of a birthday cake. It's all poorly drawn

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,420
 I think he's five she's five so don't expect to see some Thomas can Kate stuff

32
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,060
 It's a birthday cake and then there's a man. These are all stick figures. There's a stick figure sitting in a chair

33
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,060
 There's another stick figure on what appears to be their knees in

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,560
 front of the man in the chair and

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,160
 Then there's a third stick figure who is identified as a woman has a long hair like how a little girl would draw a woman

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,660
 Stick figure and she has her hands to her face

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:14,720
 She's sad Mike's looking at this picture and he's like what one one tarnation is this I love you uncle Mike

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 You save that forever

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,220
 She goes back

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,100
 Who's the drink more milk? So why are we talking about this this child's drawing?

41
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,740
 There was a post online recently where it was like misunderstood children's drawings like isn't it so funny?

42
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,420
 It's supposed to be this thing, but it's really this other thing. You had all these responses. Oh that one's fake

43
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:43,160
 That one's real da da da da da da da da, but in the middle of all that stuff is a deleted post. It's actually been removed from the internet

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,820
 Now I have also posted his post on I put it in the show notes, but I removed his name

45
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,880
 I actually took a screenshot of it. I was so interested by the story when I saw it

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,320
 I took a screenshot

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,400
 But I posted so you could actually see what he wrote I removed any identifying information from the post itself because obviously he doesn't

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,100
 Want this part to remain out there connected to him, but he says I got this picture from my five-year-old niece

49
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,960
 The weirdest thing is and again this was all about like children's drawings like funny children's runs that could be misinterpreted

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,720
 He goes I asked her what's going on in this picture and she goes

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,080
 I don't know she goes that's you in the chair

52
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,120
 But I don't know who that person is by you and he points to the woman who's walking away goes

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
 Who's that and she goes that's your girlfriend?

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,920
 She's sad

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,360
 And he said he goes what is really terrifying?

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,360
 Was at the time not all this birthday party was going on

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,280
 But he goes in this period of time. I was cheating on my girlfriend

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,200
 when my girlfriend left he goes I had more than one woman swing by my place and

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,760
 Give me a blowjob. We weren't sleeping together

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,840
 Eaton's not cheating. This was his motto. He goes. There's no way she would have known that

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,480
 There's no way at all. She would have known that

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,440
 But here is a drawing of what was going on now

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,860
 According to this this is gone now. We have the screenshot, but there's no follow-up to this that I could find

64
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,120
 So it's not like his girlfriend caught him

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,860
 But one of the things I've never cheated on anyone in a relationship

66
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,160
 But one of the things about when you do cheat on someone in the relationship, they know

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,880
 They know so his girlfriend probably was sad because she knew something was off and she couldn't figure it out. I find that super

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,700
 Fascinating and so funny. I saw that it was so fascinating to me. I took a screen. I read

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:38,240
 nonsense all the time and I saw that and it stuck with me and I read that during the vacation I

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,680
 Took a screenshot, which I'm glad I did. I you know stuff gets deleted all the time

71
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,480
 And it's a one-off creepy story, right? This guy is engaging in a horrible act

72
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,560
 He's cheating on his significant other and this child somehow knows what's going on

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,600
 She she says I don't know what the person's doing down between like the little girl wasn't drawing a sex act

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,280
 But she was somehow seeing this she didn't know what it was though and

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:12,280
 What's so funny about this is I have a similar story that I have had in my maybe folder for over a year

76
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,480
 I researched this 400 episodes ago, and I thought it was too creepy

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,200
 Even for a radio. I thought it was too weird and too disturbing even for dead rabbit radio, but it is so related to this

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 Milk-o-mucci get behind the wheel of that Jason Jalopy. We're driving a couple houses down

79
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,920
 It's the same neighborhood is a really weird neighborhood or once again in a suburban neighborhood in America

80
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,160
 I presume it could be in the Balkan states where I know but we're walking into this house. It's really nice

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,400
 Really nice house. There's a little party going on people drink and wine watching the big game

82
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,720
 And as you kind of move through the house you start to see like the crowd gets a little younger

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,880
 So now it's like teenagers and stuff like that. Hey walla you want to go play ping-pong?

84
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,480
 Where's the beaver at apparently this house is in the 1950s this story actually takes place in the early 2000s

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,880
 But you know how parties kind of break out you have the adults hang out the little kids are normally hanging out with the adults

86
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
 Then you have the middle kids are kind of making their own group and then the teenager

87
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,640
 It's a pretty big party and in this crowd of people

88
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,000
 There's a young man named

89
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,400
 What I'm gonna make up a name if this is his actual name if you're listening to this and this happened to you and your name

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,480
 Having to be Jones. I apologize, but we're gonna meet this young man named Jones

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,860
 And before this party even starts I have to go back in time a little bit before this party even starts

92
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,320
 Jones is sitting at home alone. It's early 2000s. He's just hanging out listening to some 41 and he comes up with an idea

93
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
 It's like some 41

94
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,320
 Will make me think of this next thing some 41 makes him think hmm. I wonder what it would be like to

95
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,720
 Taste my own ejaculate

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:56,920
 He used those words I don't think he was dr. Rangstein, but he thinks I wonder what happened if I tasted this stuff

97
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,520
 Wonder what happens. He's not gonna turn into a month. He's not gonna turn into Frankenstein

98
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,260
 It's not that he was just wondering he was curious about tasting it

99
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
 But he's this guy is Jones

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,680
 Thing Jones is a go-getter Jones does he's not just gonna like put it in a cup

101
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,960
 like some lame-o Jones actually comes up with the idea to

102
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,900
 Somehow do this apparently apparently he belongs to Cirque du Soleil

103
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,080
 He's going to not only taste his own ejaculate. He's going to ejaculate into his own mouth

104
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 So he's gonna like

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,720
 He gets a hot wheels track and makes a loop-de-loop or something like that

106
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,360
 I assume he's standing on his arms standing on his hands at this point

107
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,040
 Anyways, he comes up with this idea to ejaculate in his own mouth and he does and then he instantly regrets it

108
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,800
 Right. He which which is the post-coital regret

109
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,320
 He's like that was

110
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,280
 One I didn't turn into the wolf man to my arms are super uncomfortable three

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,880
 This this is grow this is just gross in my mouth the next day

112
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 So that all happened the day before the party next day. It's the party. Hey now you're an all-star

113
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,900
 He's so glad some 41 is not playing on the radio. He could never listen to that band again

114
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,320
 So I can on the parties doing finger guns to people. Oh, Joan. You're such a crack up

115
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,260
 Do you ever call someone he's like a cut up oh that guy's such a load

116
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,800
 That's mid from now on when someone's really funny be like dude. You're such a load

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,540
 So that joke makes sense. Anyways, he's walking around he goes and he's on the trampoline in the backyard

118
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,200
 There's this big trampoline in the backyard everyone's bouncing up and down on it and

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,400
 There's all these kids all these young people teenagers everything are jumping on this giant trampoline

120
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,480
 one of the people on the trampoline is this boy named opi and

121
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,560
 He was mute. He was deaf and he was mentally challenged, but that's okay. It's a trampoline, right?

122
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,080
 You don't need any of that stuff to enjoy bouncing up and bouncing up and down and almost breaking your limbs every three seconds

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,840
 So Jones is bouncing on the trampoline opi's bouncing on the trampoline a bunch of people are bouncing on the trampoline

124
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,960
 But over time

125
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,720
 Families are like Betty time to go home. Oh, oh your dad's such a load. Oh those jokes. He was telling

126
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,280
 Time over time

127
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,900
 People are leaving the party till eventually only Jones and opi are bouncing up and down

128
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:33,620
 On this trampoline the sun barely peeking over the mountain range a crow a crow is sitting watching the two young men

129
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,940
 still on the trampoline

130
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,900
 Jones Jones is not aware of the sinister events him and opi are bouncing on trampoline by themselves and then opi

131
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,520
 Kind of like does a little belly flop just are doing tricks

132
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:55,340
 Super showing off he kind of jumps down and then he's sitting there and opi stares at Jones and starts

133
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
 laughing

134
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:05,500
 But opi's laughing and Jones is kind of still bouncing on the trampoline being like why is he why is he laughing?

135
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,860
 opi's like younger than him opi's younger teenager and

136
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,640
 Jones is still bouncing up and down on the trampoline and opi is kind of rocking back and forth laughing and

137
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,660
 Is pointing at Jones laughing and Jones kind of starts bouncing slower and slower and goes. Why are you laughing at me?

138
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,700
 He said that opi pointed at his crotch and started pretending to masturbate and then pointing out his mouth

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,780
 While the whole time with his other hand pointing at me and he's laughing

140
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,900
 Jones has lost all interest in the trampoline at this point no bouncing allowed. He's just staring at opi

141
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,180
 And he thought there was no way

142
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,940
 There is no way this kid

143
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,580
 Could have known what I did

144
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,180
 Was just yesterday. I totally regret doing I instantly regretted doing it and here it is just me and opi on this trampoline and he

145
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,020
 knows my shame

146
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:08,100
 Jones just kind of shook his head, but he knew that the kid was right

147
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,780
 Jones

148
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,100
 Takes one final jump off the trampoline and heads back inside the house

149
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,060
 It's creepy. It's so funny because I didn't tell that story one because I don't want to embarrass the guy even though he posted it online

150
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,140
 I assumed at some point he would erase it. It has been erased

151
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,100
 -

152
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,940
 It's more sexually suggestive than a lot of stuff I cover on the show three. It's downright disturbing

153
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,700
 I find this really fascinating and find the story really fascinating

154
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:44,940
 Because what you have is two children spread across these stories take place across different decades and they're able to not only see

155
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,860
 Something they shouldn't have information about but they're actually able to see a secret the narrators are trying to hide

156
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,940
 It's not like they're thinking. Oh, you had grapes today, right? Did you have grape jelly all over your shirt?

157
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,460
 They're actually seeing something that you would remain that you wished would remain hidden

158
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,980
 It's like they're tapped into some sort of guilt matrix

159
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,460
 Very odd detail could be completely made up could be a one-off thing

160
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,940
 I thought it was weird that I've come across at least two cases of this and you wonder if it happens more often

161
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,020
 That more I'm not saying all children, but there could be a lot of children out there who are able to

162
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,420
 tap into other people's sins

163
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,420
 They can't make sense of them because these sins are so adult

164
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,660
 The emotions are so adult the actions are so adult and the children can't really understand

165
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,500
 What they're seeing or sensing

166
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,220
 So they have to use childlike terms to describe it

167
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,180
 But here's the thing we all know we all know children are creepy by default

168
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,680
 So if even a few of them have this power

169
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,820
 No more no more babies. No more babies can be born now the next time babies are like walking by I'm like move along

170
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:06,420
 Nothing to see here. No mental stuff to see here. They see me eat a bunch of grapes drinking my patreon supporters milk you mochi

171
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,300
 Let's go ahead and call in that carbonicop to relieve me behind the suburban neighborhood. We are headed out to

172
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,020
 the Vatican City

173
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,740
 This is a really cool story that was sent to me by AZ

174
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,820
 Really really appreciate this one. It's funny when he sent it over to me

175
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,300
 I kind of thought it was a joke not that he was playing a joke on me his live or fools

176
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,580
 It's that it sounded funny when I first heard of it and then I looked into it and it's quite terrifying

177
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,100
 It was a nice little twist. I was like I liked being surprised on the story. So thank you, AZ

178
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,620
 We're in Vatican City and we are here just in time. We're attending a

179
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,060
 Exorcism

180
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,060
 seminar

181
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:54,540
 You're like dude, this is so awesome. We sold that movie. I brought my own holy water. No, we're it's a stuffy

182
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,820
 It's a stuffy seminar. There's a slide projector

183
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,020
 Super boring, but we're sitting there and Monsignor Steven Rosetti is he's doing the slideshow

184
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
 He's doing this presentation about exorcisms

185
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,540
 and

186
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
 He's talking about this case he had a

187
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,580
 There was an exorcism that took two

188
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,940
 Years to complete. That's one thing a lot of people get confused about exorcisms

189
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,500
 They think it's like the movie you just show up do a couple rituals

190
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:27,260
 Maybe it takes like a day or two throw some holy water say the right words demon spins around jumps out finds the nearest trampoline

191
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,220
 Wee wee there's a little kid sitting on it. He was like, oh, this is not gonna end well for me

192
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
 I got a lot of secrets

193
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,540
 Exorcisms can take a long period of time which is an interesting tidbit, which is an interesting exorcism tidbit

194
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,100
 It's not generally a one night thing

195
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,380
 So they'll often take breaks they'll often we covered a story about that a long time ago

196
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,940
 It's actually the one episode of the show that gave me nightmares. I'll put it in the show notes

197
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,900
 Where the exorcists took a break and they shouldn't have and really bad things happen

198
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,020
 I actually had nightmares after recording that episode, but

199
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,900
 You have this Monsignor they're doing this exorcism for two years they get a couple demons out

200
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:11,780
 The guy's doing okay demons show back up continue the exorcisms or he just they had some just holding on that whole time

201
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,940
 But two years into this they're doing this

202
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,300
 Exorcism and one of the things is you want to know the demons name you want to know who you're dealing with so a lot of times

203
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,460
 You'll compel them to tell you their name

204
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,020
 so the Monsignor is demanding to know this demons name and

205
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,900
 It gives a name that the Monsignor didn't expect you do because you heard the intro to this episode, but he didn't expect it

206
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,620
 This demon really this spirit says I am Judas is

207
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,820
 cariat

208
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,460
 This person's eyes go from side to side. I don't know if I pronounced that right, but I am Judas

209
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,860
 I'm the dude who sold Jesus out to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver

210
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,660
 If you haven't attended if you've never attended Bible school

211
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,580
 He was one of the disciples who's the traitor he betrayed Jesus and said he's over there and the Romans grabbed Jesus

212
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,340
 held the quote-unquote trial crucified him Jesus comes back to life

213
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,860
 There

214
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,580
 School now you got it. You got the whole story Judas is obviously obviously. He's a

215
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:21,740
 Pivotal evil figure evil human figure in biblical tradition. He is the one who turned in Jesus Christ

216
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,020
 So Monsignor Steven Rosetti is looking at this dude and he's like

217
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,180
 On the bed and he's talking and saying I'm Judas and now

218
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:38,180
 Steven Rosetti says listen, I have been doing exorcisms for a long time and I've never encountered

219
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,340
 Someone possessed by a ghost

220
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,620
 He says that after this exorcism and I'll get into how they get rid of Judas in a second

221
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,140
 But after the exorcism he talks to other exorcists and he goes hey guys you won't believe what happened

222
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
 They're like Judas. He's like, what do you know?

223
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,100
 apparently Judas had been popping up in

224
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,300
 Possessions it's not super common

225
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,080
 But he does there's actually a exorcism case that lasted from

226
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,460
 1975 to 1978 it was a woman in Switzerland

227
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,940
 There's actually a transcript of that

228
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,720
 Exorcism it'll be in the show notes originally I was going to do like a dramatic reading of it

229
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 I decided not to

230
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,580
 Decided not to be in the haunted closet playing the role of an actual evil spirit repeating the words

231
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,820
 So you can do that you can do that at home, but basically I'll sum it up for you

232
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,460
 It's the priest compelling him to leave and Judas mean like now I like it here boss

233
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,220
 There's a lot of stretching actually that's a little more dramatic than actually is but he's telling him a leave and Judas is like

234
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,180
 No, no, and then Judas is like you don't understand like the priest. I I'm a little so I'm a little sauce

235
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:55,260
 Authentic it is but Judas is basically like you the priest today suck because they don't teach the way that Jesus wanted them

236
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,440
 The guy's like writing it down. He's like I hope the Pope gets this

237
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,260
 This is my complaint letter to him basically Judas is complaining that

238
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:09,900
 Satan not even complaining. He's saying that Satan's winning and here's all the ways to defeat Satan

239
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,460
 But I'm kind of poking you I'm kind of poking you and saying you'll never defeat me because you guys aren't teaching the eight

240
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:23,180
 Cataclysms you're only teaching the six so it's a little suspect on that, but anyways, it wasn't interesting reading

241
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:28,620
 I'm just gonna read the words of a departed spirit in my haunted closet, and it was super long

242
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,500
 He's talking to these other exorcists, and they say oh no, we've encountered Judas as well

243
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,840
 And one thing he found in common with all these other exorcists and his experience as well

244
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,900
 Nearly impossible to remove

245
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,300
 nearly impossible to

246
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,780
 Exercise out of the human body the Monsignor says that he has gone toe to toe with some high ranking demons

247
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,660
 There's a method to this an exorcism at its core is basically

248
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:03,100
 Scientific for lack of a better term you had like science you want to add baking soda and vinegar

249
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,260
 You make you make the volcano that's how volcanoes are born

250
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,940
 You know it's gonna do it the exact same time you get the measurements right same thing with exorcisms

251
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:19,180
 You say the right words you command the right things use the right items like holy water holy relics the demon will leave the body

252
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,780
 The none of this is working on Judas holy water. He's taking a bath. He's like more more. I'm so filthy from being possessed

253
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,740
 The rights weren't working on the exorcism rights were working and the Monsignors thinking about this again

254
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,500
 This isn't a one-day thing that they're dealing with Judas. He's thinking about it. He goes Jesus in the Bible

255
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,700
 Jesus gives his disciples the ability to

256
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,500
 Command demons out of bodies. That's one of the powers that Jesus passes on to his followers

257
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,940
 But it's fallen angels is specifically what they have the power to get rid of not fallen humans

258
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,420
 Jesus like I'll teach you guys that tomorrow. He's flying up to heaven. No, no, I think we're gonna need that

259
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
 He's like bye. See you when I come back

260
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,040
 so they don't know that skill and he goes we tried everything to exercise this man of

261
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,940
 Judas he wouldn't leave

262
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:17,340
 Apparently what happened is the end the Virgin Mary showed up. I don't know

263
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:24,840
 Here's the thing here's the thing I believe in demons and I believe in exorcisms and stuff like that

264
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,980
 I don't know how this happened. I don't know if she came like in the vision

265
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,100
 I don't know she walks through the door and they're like whoa, and it's like you and Judas Judas actually nothing about Jews

266
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 Judas would know her

267
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,820
 Judas probably in real life outside of outside of the exorcism Judas would have met Jesus his mom

268
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,100
 You have the disciples over for dinner. Mary's like making a bunch of like food make much of lasagna. They're like, whoa

269
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,220
 This is magical. This doesn't exist back now and she's like, I know it's gonna be super delicious someday

270
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,940
 He would have known her but anyways the Virgin Mary shows up. I don't know if it was a vision

271
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,300
 I don't know if she physically showed up

272
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,940
 If she physically if she physically showed up, I think he would have gone with that

273
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,500
 I don't think he would have told this whole story about Judas first. He would show up the Vatican be like guys

274
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,260
 I know we're having an exorcism seminar, but you won't believe what just happened the Virgin Mary just showed up

275
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,860
 She's walked into a room and they're like why'd she walk in the room? He's like, okay

276
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:24,900
 Now let me tell you the Judas story because you don't bury the lead on the Blessed Virgin Mary just walking into a room

277
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,980
 Being like hey guys, what's up got any lasagna? How's my lasagna recipe doing?

278
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,380
 Mary comes down and she compels Judas to leave this young man's body and that's when Judas is like I'm out and

279
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,280
 He floats away the spirit floats away. It's an interesting story again

280
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,660
 There's a lot of ifs if you're skeptic

281
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,540
 It's just kind of a fun story if you believe in demons and things like that. It's actually incredibly chilling

282
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,540
 Because the one thing you want to hope for is if you do get possessed by a demon, which is one thing you don't want

283
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,380
 There's a lot of things you don't want you want to get attacked by someone possessed by demon either

284
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,940
 But you want to at least believe that someone could rescue you someone could pull your consciousness out of that demonic control

285
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,800
 And we have all these safety mechanisms and all of these prayers and rituals that can help

286
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,780
 Reverse the demonic possession, but now they're running into something that is immune to all of that

287
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,300
 And it's a fellow human not just a human, but one of the most reviled humans in

288
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,420
 Biblical tradition

289
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
 Possessing people

290
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,940
 The idea of whether or not a human can possess somebody is

291
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,540
 Theologically divisive

292
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,820
 Some say they shouldn't be able to do that. That's the province of demons. That's something that demons have the ability to do

293
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,640
 They can corrupt you they can make promises to you. They can trick you

294
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,300
 But the idea of someone being possessed by a ghost is

295
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,980
 It's not unheard of

296
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,220
 But it's so rare

297
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,020
 The only other instance I could really think of we covered it back on episode

298
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,780
 367 the patriarch there was an allegation. It was never proven

299
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:12,060
 There's an allegation that the father of the family was possessed by the grandfather of the family and he murdered everyone or convinced them to kill themselves

300
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,980
 I think

301
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:21,900
 But being possessed being possessed by demons is synonymous. That's really what possession is demonic possessions being possessed by an earth human is quite rare and

302
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,820
 There's the and we don't even know if that was the case in the patriarch episode

303
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,620
 The question is is could it happen at all? Like it would basically be like you have a house and then it's possessed by another house

304
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,900
 It would be like two houses mixed together, but you know what I mean like a human soul and

305
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:45,220
 A human soul not in a body. How do those interact? It's the same thing

306
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,340
 The demon would latch on to some sort of parasite. It's almost designed for demonic possession

307
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:57,260
 It's almost designed to take control of you now a demon can pretend to be a human

308
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:02,460
 Right a demon could pretend to be a human and you think you're possessed by a human

309
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,380
 But the same exorcism rights would work against that thing because they're not actually a human

310
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:14,580
 This thing claiming to be Judas apparently was Judas none of the proper rights of exorcism would work on this dude

311
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,820
 And I actually think being possessed by a ghost might be scarier

312
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,140
 Because you imagine that demons live in this world

313
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,940
 They're looking at the game board the idea of the demonic war between heaven and hell is they have an endgame

314
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,620
 They go we know eventually Jesus is going to come back

315
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,140
 We're gonna have this huge battle and Armageddon

316
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,580
 We're quote-unquote prophesies to lose but we think we can actually win we think we can do this

317
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,500
 So let's summon our troops. We see people are starting to live really good lives

318
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,380
 We see someone who's gonna end up inspiring millions. Let's go to them. Let's ruin their lives

319
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,380
 We see this person out here. They're making a difference in their community. Let's go to them

320
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,860
 Let's get them addicted to drugs like we are looking at this game board

321
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,940
 And if we can keep upsetting the pieces if we keep attaching ourselves to these people

322
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,980
 Who are trying to better themselves try to better the world?

323
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,660
 We can maybe

324
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,900
 Pull out a W in the end

325
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,500
 The demons are looking at this huge battle plan

326
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,660
 There's seven billion and counting moving pieces and

327
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,660
 The demons may be looking at these things where we're gonna put our forces here. We're gonna deal with this

328
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,860
 We're gonna do this you just moving through the masses of humanity may go unknown

329
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,580
 May be totally unseen

330
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:40,060
 You're not a pivotal player in this war between heaven and hell just like me just a dude living life

331
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,300
 Trying to make the best of it, but since the ghost has no plan

332
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,900
 It's just energy. It's angry energy. It's mad that it didn't get what it wanted on earth

333
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,860
 Everyone's a target

334
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:59,020
 Not just the youth ministers not just the drug counselors not just the politicians

335
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,220
 Every single person can fall victim to a possessed human

336
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,540
 Doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter what you plan on doing. It doesn't matter what you've done in the past

337
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,420
 Everyone is a target

338
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
 That is terrifying

339
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,700
 When you go into politics, you know people are gonna write you nasty letters

340
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:26,060
 You know people may try to assassinate you you know that there will be spiritual forces trying to go to you one way or the other

341
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,740
 You don't expect that when you're the garbage man

342
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,620
 You don't expect that when you're a video game tester

343
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,500
 You don't expect that when you're just a student

344
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,660
 But there you are

345
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,780
 Looking at your reflection in the mirror one day

346
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,660
 You get a flash of something else

347
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
 behind your own eyes

348
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,660
 You never played a Ouija board you never went to have your tarot cards read you never engaged in anything that could open yourself up to

349
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,180
 demonic forces

350
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,780
 But sometimes when you're sitting at home eating dinner

351
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,620
 Your right hand shakes a bit

352
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,340
 When it reaches for that knife

353
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:12,480
 You never wanted to change the world you never wanted to do anything more than have fun

354
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,220
 But now you find yourself somehow

355
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,240
 Standing outside a stranger's home in the middle of a rainstorm

356
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,760
 You don't get to live your life now

357
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 It lives your life

358
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,920
 It drives you it commands you it makes you do horrible things and you can just watch it

359
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,440
 from behind your own eyes

360
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,040
 And after you have annihilated families after you have led police on a multi-state

361
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,440
 Hunt it is not until you are tried

362
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,440
 convicted in sentence to death

363
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,480
 That the spirit of this vicious bloodthirsty human

364
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,760
 Leaves your body leaves you to sit in the cell leaves you to contemplate

365
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,160
 Leaves you the memories of the crimes it committed

366
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
 And when the appeals have run out

367
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,480
 When you yourself are being laid down on that metal bed a

368
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,580
 Needle inserted into your arm that will slowly inject medication that will stop your heart

369
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,840
 You pray for mercy, but none comes

370
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:38,280
