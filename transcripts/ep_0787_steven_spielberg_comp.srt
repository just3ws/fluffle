1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
 A village in Russia is visited by a stranger.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,320
 A very tall stranger.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
 And then we take a look at one of the most bizarre true crime stories I've come across

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,840
 in a long time.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
 We're gonna meet a man named Jonathan Norman.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,520
 A man with a plan.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,200
 A man with a goal.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,160
 He wants to rape Steven Spielberg.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:36,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,320
 I hope you guys had a totally awesome weekend and had lots of fun doing some really cool

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 stuff.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,880
 So I did get your emails and I did get your YouTube comments.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,760
 Friday's episode was a little depressing.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 Write the story about my blind friend.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,760
 Just don't bring it back up man.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 Just don't bring it back up.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,600
 I just wouldn't have ignored that episode.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 I know it's depressing.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 I was thinking about it afterwards.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,120
 It was more depressing because it didn't have an ending.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
 It was just like I don't know if she's still alive.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,120
 I don't know if she still has a job.

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
 See you guys next week.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,120
 It was super bizarre.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,520
 It was super bizarre.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,520
 And I try not doing...

31
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,360
 I do cover depressing stuff on the show but I have a rule.

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
 I try not to cover it on Friday's.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,800
 Because then it's like you don't have anything fun.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,440
 It's not like I'm the only piece of media you absorb.

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
 But you know what I mean?

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,680
 Listen to the show for fun spooky stories.

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,880
 Then I tell the story about this poor fly woman.

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,480
 And I say see you in a couple days guys.

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
 I want to go play Creeper World 4.

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
 You're like what?

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 So I did get...

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
 I did hear loud and clear.

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
 I broke my rule.

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,000
 I normally don't talk about stuff that depressing on the weekends.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,480
 And so we're going to try to do some more lighthearted stuff.

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,000
 So not out of control.

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Not out of control.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
 I mean obviously we are going to talk about a man who is trying to rape Steven Spielberg.

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,400
 That's the most opposite of lighthearted possible.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 True story too.

51
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,680
 Absolutely fascinating story.

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,240
 But before we get into that.

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,600
 Let's go ahead and introduce our brand new Patreon for this episode.

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

55
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,440
 I don't want to be in this episode.

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
 I'm a huge Spielberg fan.

57
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
 This sounds like a horror movie.

58
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,200
 Give it up for Steven.

60
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
 Oh no!

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,680
 This is actually Steven Spielberg.

62
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,400
 I didn't think about that.

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,920
 Because his only name is first name is the Patreon name.

64
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,320
 Steven you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

65
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand.

66
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,800
 Just helps read the word about the show.

67
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,880
 Really really helps out a lot.

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
 Now Steven.

69
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 Damn it.

70
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 I just didn't plan this out.

71
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,320
 But I really should have had different people.

72
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
 Ah!

73
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
 Steven let's go ahead.

74
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
 I'm not going to fix it.

75
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
 I'm just going to keep rolling with it.

76
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,120
 Steven I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

77
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,120
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 We're gliding all the way out to Russia.

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:55,560
 Specifically we're headed out to the Volga region.

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
 So you see that region down there that I'm pointing at?

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
 Steven right there.

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,960
 That's where we're headed and then hit that time travel button right on the side.

83
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,440
 We're going back to the year 1650.

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,840
 And now it's just like lush countryside and it's all like sepia tone and stuff like that.

85
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,200
 You see like these army men walking around and they have on big old fuzzy hats.

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,760
 These guys are called Cossacks and they're walking by the Russian River and they're

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
 cracking walnuts in their mouth.

88
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,880
 That's what they're doing when they're not out like shooting bad guys or good guys.

89
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,280
 I don't really know how the Russian regime was in 1650.

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
 They could have been super brutal.

91
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,960
 They could have been quite mild.

92
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
 I don't know.

93
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,200
 But anyways the Cossacks are walking around with their little guns.

94
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,640
 This is a Cossack settlement in the region.

95
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,080
 And one day the people are like, dude, hey, look at that.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 What's that?

97
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,480
 Hey, dude, dude, put down your fuzzy hat.

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
 I can't see over your hat.

99
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 What's going on?

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,040
 And everyone's looking out and they see on the outskirts of the village, they see this

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,000
 giant dude kind of walking towards town.

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,680
 And they can immediately tell he's massive.

103
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
 Now we've covered giants on this show before.

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,200
 We've covered Bigfoot a lot, seven, eight, nine feet tall.

105
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 We've covered giants on this show like the Giant of Kandahar I think was like 12 feet

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
 tall.

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,440
 That's pretty standard for giants.

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,680
 This dude was a whopping 19 feet tall.

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,080
 This giant 19 foot tall dude, that's massive.

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 And here's the thing.

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
 You got this 19 foot tall dude walking into your village.

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,880
 That's alarming enough.

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,200
 But as they're getting closer, they realize this guy hasn't looked a panic on his face.

114
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,160
 He doesn't look like he's having a good day, which makes it a hundred times worse.

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
 You have a gentle giant showed up.

116
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,880
 If Clifford the Big Red Dog or the BFG, there's a Spielberg reference for you.

117
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,080
 I'm sure there'll be a ton of them.

118
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
 There'll be a contest if you can count all of them.

119
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 There's seven.

120
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,800
 I don't know why I haven't done them yet, but what to say there's seven.

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,080
 Giant guy's walking and he goes, "Boy, I wish I had something to put in my jaws."

122
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,240
 The giant guy's distressed.

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,920
 The giant guy is not happy.

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,200
 So that is just doubled your problems.

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,880
 You got a giant who's not happy.

126
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,440
 And apparently, so we don't have a ton of information on the story.

127
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,480
 I got it from the Alberto Rosales Humanoid Report.

128
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,440
 So I'll put it in the show notes and they got it from a report from a group called the

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,760
 Full Heavy Oranio Moscow in 2005 is when they got this report.

130
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,500
 But we don't have a ton of information about it, but we have a 19 foot tall man showing

131
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 up at a village.

132
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,560
 And if you think really logically, that should be the only thing that village ever recorded.

133
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,760
 That's the most exciting thing that's ever happened to that village ever.

134
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
 There should be tons of written documents on the sink.

135
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,080
 But war and famine, maybe during some Soviet created famine.

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,640
 They ate the pages of all the history books.

137
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
 I don't know.

138
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,160
 19 foot tall man in this village, in this Cossack village.

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
 He was there for a while.

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,840
 Not just passing through, not just people, "Pah, pa, did you see that?

141
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
 Look at that.

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
 Look like a tall man."

143
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
 Nothing like that.

144
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,260
 This guy, this guy is camping outside of the city to the point that they're able to start

145
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,340
 making connections with his activities.

146
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,020
 Not fleeting in the distance.

147
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
 Nothing like that.

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,940
 He was walking through town.

149
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,700
 Now they don't say like, "Was he like shopping?

150
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,820
 Was he like trying to eat some delicious walnuts?

151
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,060
 Was he trying to phone home?"

152
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,900
 We don't know any of these things.

153
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,740
 We just know that they, we just know that there is this 19.

154
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
 We don't know that either.

155
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,360
 I mean, this is just a story being told, but what the story tells us, there's a 19 foot

156
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,560
 tall man living in town and he's there so much that people started to realize that if

157
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,200
 he came close to you, which again, when you're 19 feet tall in a village, everywhere is close

158
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,280
 to you, when he comes close to you, you start to feel a wave of melancholy around you.

159
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,460
 This giant guy's walking through town and you're like, "I have a really good day."

160
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,140
 And then you turn the corner and you're like, "Oh, why do I start to feel so emotional?

161
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,700
 It's like almost like there's a war of the worlds inside of me between being happy and

162
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,940
 being melancholy."

163
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,580
 And then the guy passes and you're like, "Oh, it's just Barry, Barry the melancholy giant."

164
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,540
 So this guy's walking around doing all this stuff.

165
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,340
 And that's bad, right?

166
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,080
 So now you have a 19 foot tall giant, he's still upset, he's still not the most calm

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
 person.

168
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,000
 If he comes near you, you get upset.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,880
 I don't want to be upset because I don't want a 19 foot tall guy walking around my town.

170
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,080
 I guess I don't have anything with that.

171
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,440
 If a 19 foot tall guy came into my town and was like, "Cool," and stuff like that, but

172
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,520
 if he visibly upset me, if he made my soul shake.

173
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,680
 But it wasn't just that, it wasn't just the fact that he was upset that he made you upset.

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,120
 Women in town started to have miscarriages.

175
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,620
 So now you're like, "Right, Jason, real white-hearted episode there, buddy."

176
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,820
 The fact of the matter is that you can tank a giant angry guy in your village as long

177
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
 as he's not doing anything.

178
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,220
 And you can also kind of tank the fact that when he's around, makes you feel uncomfortable,

179
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,580
 but whatever.

180
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,420
 But the fact that it's now diminishing your population in 1650 Russia where there's not

181
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,100
 a ton of people to begin with, you need your babies.

182
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 You need your babies.

183
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,500
 How else are you going to have future caustic soldiers?

184
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,880
 We're just loving children.

185
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,160
 I guess you're not trying to build this imperialistic army.

186
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
 They decide.

187
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
 They put all this together.

188
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,640
 This guy's hanging out in town.

189
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
 He's always scowling.

190
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,520
 He's making us upset.

191
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,560
 And now women are not being able to have babies.

192
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
 They're having miscarriages.

193
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,600
 So the locals get pissed off about this.

194
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,720
 And again, everything I'm telling you is all the information that we have.

195
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,120
 And so when we get to the conclusion, it's even more bizarre because we're just left

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,760
 with a bunch of questions.

197
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,100
 The townspeople, they get mad at this giant for causing all these miscarriages and just

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,940
 giving them in general, just generally bummy days since he showed up.

199
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,700
 They rise up.

200
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,740
 They rise up against him and the entire town murders this 19-foot-tall man.

201
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,900
 And that's the end of the story.

202
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,780
 This is one of those stories that you hear.

203
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,740
 It's a very, very interesting story.

204
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,040
 Where did this visitor come from?

205
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,000
 Was this a demonic human hybrid?

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,560
 Was this like a nephaline type of thing?

207
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 Was this alien?

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 Was it interdimensional?

209
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,680
 Was it just a unusually tall person for their time?

210
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,880
 And then as the years have gone by, they've been like, "Ah, that man, he was at least

211
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
 five foot eight.

212
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
 A giant, a giant among men."

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
 And then over time, he's gotten bigger.

214
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
 Who knows?

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
 Multidimensional creature.

216
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
 We don't know.

217
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
 There's 100 different scenarios for this.

218
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,320
 And zero evidence.

219
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,600
 And it's super...

220
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,360
 Like, I'm not saying I wanted a...

221
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,100
 I would have enjoyed a graphic blow-by-blow battle, but it's just interesting the lack

222
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
 of details.

223
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
 It does make the story suspect.

224
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,300
 They should have giant bones and stuff like that, but that's just the skeptical side coming

225
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
 out.

226
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,820
 So it could definitely be made up.

227
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,500
 It is interesting though, as just as a spooky story.

228
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 Is it spooky?

229
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 I think it's just interesting as a spooky paranormal story because it shows how...

230
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,820
 And we've talked about this on the show and I actually hate bringing this up, and I'm

231
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,640
 gonna bring it up later this week, again, or maybe next week as well.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,200
 How powerless humans are in the midst of these creatures.

233
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,040
 And you go, "Well, Jason, yeah, but they killed this guy in the end.

234
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 They all rose up and killed..."

235
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
 Yeah, sure.

236
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
 There was enough of them, and it was an outpost, so you had a bunch of soldiers there, and

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
 you could take on a night...

238
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
 A night...

239
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,360
 Finding a 19 foot tall guy with 1650 technology, it seems like it would be bordering on the

240
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 absurd.

241
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,100
 So you probably wouldn't need a lot of people to take this thing down, but the fact that

242
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,240
 this creature, whatever it was, simply by being around humans affected their mood?

243
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,780
 Like they felt the energy of melancholy.

244
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,600
 It was like a Smashing Pumpkins album just tumbled into their soul.

245
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,060
 This is what it felt like.

246
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,740
 Just by being in its presence, they're getting such psyche, altering effects.

247
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,940
 That's a very, very powerful thing.

248
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,580
 You can't discount that at all.

249
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,240
 And the fact that this creature, just by being in town, was causing miscarriages, was killing

250
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
 humans.

251
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,440
 And so a lot of time, I know we talk a lot about beating up gray aliens on this show,

252
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,320
 which I still find highly amusing.

253
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,120
 I'll never get over the idea of just beating the crap out of one of those guys, punching

254
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,760
 them in the eyeballs.

255
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,960
 But that's all nonsense, right?

256
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,080
 These aliens, superior technology, they have the ability to freeze you in your tracks,

257
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,380
 they have telepathy, and who knows what else, right?

258
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,980
 We only hear the stories from the survivors, the people who did something really, really

259
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,300
 messed up when those gray aliens got mad and like turned them into spaghetti.

260
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
 We don't hear that message.

261
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,620
 We don't hear that story because spaghetti can't tell that story.

262
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,860
 Just with like a blink of an eye, they do something with telekinesis.

263
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
 We don't know.

264
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,940
 And so when we look at other paranormal phenomenon and how it interacts with humans, this type

265
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,860
 of stuff is important and it goes to show how powerless we can be in these situations.

266
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,240
 I would love more detail.

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
 I mean, again, 1650 is farther back.

268
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,400
 I don't really need to know how they killed the giant again.

269
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,480
 That would be really fascinating.

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,000
 I want to know the time span.

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,880
 I want to know the time span because they make it sound like it was like a period of

272
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,400
 time, a couple of weeks, enough for them to notice this stuff going on.

273
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,840
 For all I know, it was a really, really long afternoon.

274
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,320
 He walks in and he's like, "Hey guys, what's going on?"

275
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,400
 And everyone gets depressed and they murdered him.

276
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,100
 So, but I would like to know that time period, but other than that very, very fascinating

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,100
 story.

278
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,340
 And again, just how powerless we can be on our own planet.

279
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
 That's not fun.

280
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,260
 I thought it was supposed to be an uplifting episode.

281
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,020
 Stephen, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonar copter.

282
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,660
 We are leaving behind Volga, Russia.

283
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,620
 We have pockets full of walnuts while you are calling in that carbonar copter.

284
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,340
 We are headed all the way out to Pacific Palisades, California.

285
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:09,440
 The year is 1997 and there's a reporter sitting at the Los Angeles Times and something's

286
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
 not sitting right with him.

287
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
 He's looking around.

288
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 He's looking for any giants.

289
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
 He's like, "That's weird.

290
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 I feel melancholy.

291
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,080
 Is there a giant man around?"

292
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,440
 There's a whisper going through the journalism community of LA.

293
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,760
 Something really big is happening with the LAPD, the Los Angeles Police, and the court

294
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
 system.

295
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,500
 There's this grand jury being held, but the victim's name is John Doe.

296
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,060
 I was like, "That's weird.

297
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,060
 I see the name pop up all the time.

298
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
 Maybe it's a mystery.

299
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,100
 Who is this John Doe?"

300
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,580
 The journalists in the area start to get wind that there's a cover up.

301
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,700
 Somebody is covering something up and they need to get to the bottom of this.

302
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,980
 This is what journalists do.

303
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
 They investigate stuff.

304
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,580
 But they're getting stymied.

305
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,900
 They're getting stymied by the courts.

306
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,180
 They're getting stymied by the police and they just cannot figure it out.

307
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,520
 June 23rd, 1997, we're in Pacific Palisades area.

308
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,760
 Very, very wealthy part of Los Angeles.

309
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
 There's a man named Jonathan Norman.

310
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,080
 He's a 31-year-old dude.

311
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,880
 He's driving a rental car and he pulls up to the front gate at Steven Spielberg's mansion.

312
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,480
 I imagine there's Peacocks walking around and has ponds and statues shooting water and

313
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 stuff like that.

314
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
 Very idyllic.

315
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,880
 It's a very nice scene.

316
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
 Jonathan is sitting there.

317
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
 He's a buff dude.

318
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 He's a former bodybuilder.

319
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 He's a really buff guy.

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,380
 He kind of has that Hollywood good looks.

321
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,340
 He's sitting there in his car and the security guard at the gate is like, "Hey buddy, where

322
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
 are you going?"

323
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,860
 He's like, "Oh hey, my name's Jonathan.

324
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,900
 I'm a friend with David Geffen, big music producer dude.

325
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,140
 I'm sure you know of him.

326
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,260
 Anyways, I'm a friend of David Geffen's and he sent me here to meet with Steven Spielberg.

327
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,220
 So why don't you hit that little button and make that gate go, "Ooh, I'll just drive on

328
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,860
 in and I'll try not to run over any Peacocks."

329
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,420
 And the guards aren't going to let this guy in, right?

330
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,420
 They don't know this dude.

331
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,200
 I thought it'd be the easiest thing to say.

332
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 They're not going to let him in, but when he's like, "No, I got to get in there.

333
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,440
 I got to see Steven Spielberg."

334
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,560
 One of the guards goes, "Well, he's not even here.

335
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 He's in Ireland."

336
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
 So, I mean, even if we did let you in, there's nothing you could do.

337
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,600
 I mean, you might be able to place some sort of horrible trap and hide in his house for

338
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
 a couple weeks until he comes back and then spring up and grab him.

339
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,040
 But I mean, that's just ridiculous.

340
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,400
 No one would actually do that.

341
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 So just leave.

342
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
 And Jonathan's like taking notes as he's talking.

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
 He's like, "Ooh, I didn't think about that."

344
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,100
 On July 9th, Johnny takes his buddy Charles Markovich driving him around town.

345
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,740
 He goes, "Hey, you want to go see something cool?

346
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
 You want to go see the outside?

347
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,740
 You want to see the outside of Steven Spielberg's house?"

348
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,740
 What?

349
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
 Yeah, it's awesome.

350
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
 Does it have Peacocks?

351
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
 It has all the Peacocks.

352
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,900
 So they're driving up through Pacific Palisades and Charles is sitting there.

353
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,180
 I want you, you really have to put yourself in this situation, right?

354
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,100
 Because we obviously know a true crime story is about to unfold.

355
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,480
 But imagine you're sitting in a car with your buddy Jonathan.

356
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,200
 You're sitting outside Steven Spielberg's house in this car and you're just sitting

357
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,160
 in the passenger seat and Jonathan pulls out a day planner.

358
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,360
 You're like, "That's worth those things.

359
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
 They still exist.

360
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,520
 They're super popular in 1997."

361
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:18,720
 And as he's fiddling with the day planner, you see a photo in there and you go, "Hey,

362
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 what?

363
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 What was that?"

364
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 And Steven goes, "Oh, this?"

365
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,760
 And he opens the day planner fully up.

366
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,700
 And it's a photo of a naked man with Steven Spielberg's head pasted on the...

367
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,220
 Where the dude's head was.

368
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,460
 It wasn't like he was juggling Steven Spielberg's head.

369
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,500
 There's a bunch of them floating around.

370
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,420
 The head, the face was replaced with Steven Spielberg's face.

371
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,260
 So first off, you have to comprehend the shot of a young naked man with Steven Spielberg's

372
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,660
 face on it.

373
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,940
 And you're trapped in a car with this guy.

374
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,620
 It's not like there's lava outside the car, but you're in the car with this guy and you're

375
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,480
 looking at this and you see a naked photo of a man with Steven Spielberg's face.

376
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,040
 So that's odd enough.

377
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,480
 And then he turned...

378
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,720
 You obviously go, "What is that?

379
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,800
 Why do you have that?

380
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 Why does that exist?

381
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,080
 There's so many questions."

382
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,840
 And then Jonathan turns to Charles and says, "Hey, I'm not going to do this right now.

383
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
 So don't worry.

384
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
 You're not part of this.

385
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,240
 But one of these days, Charles, I am..."

386
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
 See that fence right there?

387
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:29,660
 You're sitting outside Steven Spielberg's house naked photo, Photoshop photo of Steven Spielberg

388
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,780
 in this dude's possession.

389
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,660
 He goes, "Charles, one of these days, a man has to have a dream, right?

390
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,100
 I'm going to climb this fence.

391
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:43,020
 I'm going to go into that house and I'm going to rape Steven Spielberg."

392
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,460
 Now again, this is one of those stories where I want to have a little more context.

393
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,300
 How long did they sit there?

394
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,840
 At what point did Charles go, "You know what?

395
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
 I'm going to walk.

396
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,120
 I know that it's 30 miles away from my destination, but I'm good.

397
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,720
 I'm not going to be in the car with you anymore."

398
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,880
 Did he then just drive away after making that statement?

399
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 Did they sit there for a while and watch Peacock?

400
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,680
 It's like, "What was going on?

401
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
 How do you respond to that?"

402
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,360
 Now, I know how I would respond to that.

403
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,120
 I'd go, "Are you serious?"

404
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,840
 And I'd probably chuckle because I wouldn't think he was real.

405
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,400
 And then I'd go, "Where'd you get that sexy photo of Steven Spielberg?"

406
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
 I'm one of those.

407
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
 Do they have one of George Lucas?

408
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,660
 But anyways, now it's July 11th.

409
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
 It's seven in the morning.

410
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,340
 And at this point, security has seen he's rented a different car now.

411
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,660
 He's rented a car that looks like Steven Spielberg's wife's car.

412
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,060
 So it's not so noticeable in an area.

413
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,780
 But Steven Spielberg's wife, one, is in Ireland with Steven Spielberg and the family.

414
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
 Two, it's not a bodybuilder.

415
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,100
 It's not a giant muscular man, right?

416
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,060
 The fact that the car looks the same, it kind of works like at first clients, but that's

417
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,960
 obviously not her beyond the wheel.

418
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
 And so security has already been like, "Hey, you got to leave."

419
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
 And he's like, "What?

420
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
 No, my car just broke down."

421
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,920
 And they're like, "Well, your car needs to break down somewhere else."

422
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,240
 So that had happened before, but now we're on July 11th at seven in the morning.

423
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,120
 Now this entire area is patrolled by private security, very, very wealthy area.

424
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,160
 So homeowners start calling the security company and they have people on site.

425
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,360
 And it's seven in the morning.

426
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,700
 Seven in the morning and the West Tech security officers on the scene start to get reports

427
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,140
 from neighbors, people in the area saying, "Someone's running through my backyard.

428
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,660
 I just saw a guy run through my backyard.

429
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,420
 It looked like he had a big stick and he's just kind of running around."

430
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,980
 And security guards are like, "What?

431
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,300
 This is a nice area.

432
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,340
 Most people don't mess with this."

433
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,740
 But they start looking in the backyards, trying to check this out.

434
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:41,340
 And sure enough, they see a muscular man holding a five foot long stick running through the

435
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
 backyard.

436
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,720
 And they go, "Hey, look, it's Steven Spielberg's wife."

437
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,040
 And they go, "No, no, no, you buffoon.

438
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
 Chase him."

439
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
 So people are start chasing.

440
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
 The security's chasing this guy.

441
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,600
 And as he's running, he gets into Steven Spielberg's backyard.

442
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,920
 And then the chase continues and he ends up under a bush at some point and they drag,

443
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,040
 security drags him out.

444
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,120
 Now this man has an answer for everything.

445
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,000
 They are not good answers, but he has an answer for every single question.

446
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,700
 First off, first question you want to know is, "Who are you?"

447
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,980
 And he says, "I," good sir, as he stands and he's dusting himself off, "I am David Spielberg."

448
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,020
 Steven Spielberg's a long lost son.

449
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,780
 Long lost non-Jewish son who's a giant bodybuilder.

450
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,420
 And you never heard of me, but here I am.

451
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,660
 And they kind of go, "Well, okay, go check that out."

452
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
 They didn't have the internet back then.

453
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,900
 They're like, "We might have to take his word on that one."

454
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,960
 Why are you running through people's backyards?

455
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,400
 And David Spielberg kind of scoffs.

456
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,280
 I mean, this guy's a big shot in town, right?

457
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,360
 He scoffs and he goes, "Because of the jackals?"

458
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
 The jackals, good sir, were chasing me.

459
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,240
 If you were being chased by the jackals, what would you do?

460
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,760
 Would you simply stand there and get jackaled?

461
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,520
 The security guards are like, "What are you talking about?"

462
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
 And he goes, "The jackals!"

463
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,720
 And he points at Steven Spielberg has a bunch of security dogs, apparently.

464
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,140
 So for whatever reason, he kept calling them jackals.

465
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,420
 Now for all I know, Steven Spielberg actually has a bunch of jackals in his backyard.

466
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,620
 But that's, he was explaining why he was running.

467
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,060
 He was running to get away from these attack dogs.

468
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,060
 And they go, "Okay, okay, so maybe you are David Spielberg."

469
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,460
 Because he does have a big family.

470
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,820
 And maybe the dogs scared you because those dogs aren't quite scary.

471
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,060
 I saw them non-on-aligns bones earlier.

472
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,180
 But how do you explain that?

473
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:44,600
 And they point to the ground and David looks down and while they were dragging him out

474
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,120
 of the bushes, his day planner fell open and a bunch of naked photos of his dad, a bunch

475
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,200
 of naked photos of Steven Spielberg fell out.

476
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,760
 And they're like, "We should have just sent that right away, right?"

477
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
 You're obviously not David Spielberg.

478
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,440
 And if you are, you need a lot of help.

479
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,560
 If you're making photos like this of your own father.

480
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,340
 At that point, so this all went on, they release him.

481
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,660
 1030 in the morning they go, "Oh, Jonathan, you're free to go.

482
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,340
 Give us that big stick.

483
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
 You're free to go.

484
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,840
 Don't come back."

485
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,340
 You hear?

486
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,980
 510 PM that same day.

487
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,260
 He's sitting in that rented car on the street and security is like, "Are you kidding me?

488
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,220
 They see him just sitting there."

489
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
 And so they call the police.

490
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,860
 They're like, "We're done with this, right?

491
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,620
 We don't even want to look at those photos again."

492
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,740
 They call the police.

493
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,160
 The police show up and they begin searching him, searching his vehicle, all that stuff.

494
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,200
 They have the authority to do this.

495
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,960
 So he has a litany of allegations against him.

496
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
 He's in the area.

497
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,120
 He's not leaving trespassing, all this stuff.

498
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:55,360
 They talk to him and they find on him handcuffs, box cutter, and duct tape.

499
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,960
 That stuff was literally what was on him.

500
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,800
 That's what he had in his pockets.

501
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,720
 Because then they searched the car.

502
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,100
 They found more handcuffs.

503
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,100
 They found more photos of Steven Spielberg.

504
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,060
 They're like, "Oh man, it's this montage."

505
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,220
 The officer's like, "Oh, can I get an early retirement?"

506
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,740
 They're like filing for PTSD.

507
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,900
 And more razor blades.

508
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,860
 This guy, I mean, how many razor blades do you need to assault Steven Spielberg?

509
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,500
 The police then ask, "Why do you have all this stuff?"

510
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,900
 And he said, "Well, guys, I'm tired.

511
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,080
 Have you ever heard of Steven Spielberg?"

512
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,440
 And they're like, "Don't give us the Steven Spielberg thing."

513
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 He goes, "Okay."

514
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,920
 He goes, "I have a script.

515
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,600
 I'm working on a script with Steven Spielberg.

516
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
 And these are props.

517
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,320
 These are props for the script."

518
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,400
 The detective's must be thinking, "Do you know what a script was?"

519
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,960
 Normally, the script doesn't have props.

520
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
 It's just writing.

521
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
 He's just wearing some paper.

522
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,320
 He goes, "I get it special."

523
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
 This script has props.

524
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,640
 And they go, "Okay, well, what's the script about?"

525
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:05,980
 And he goes, "Well, it's about a man raping another man."

526
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,560
 And the officers are looking at each other and they're like, "Can we just have one normal

527
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,060
 day being a police officer?

528
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,720
 What are you talking about?"

529
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
 You wrote a script about a man raping another man.

530
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,900
 You've been trying to break into this doot house multiple times, driving up to the gate,

531
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
 trying to get in the backyard.

532
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 You're scoping out of the area.

533
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,340
 You have all this stuff.

534
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,680
 And then they added this quote into this legal document.

535
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,200
 There was a legal summary of the case.

536
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,640
 And after that, after he explained that what it was, it was props for a script about a

537
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,960
 man raping another man, this is written in the legal document.

538
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,520
 "No screenplay was found in the car."

539
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,800
 Which to me would have been more shocking, the fact that he actually went through the

540
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,840
 trouble to write 120 pages detailing this, but he didn't.

541
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,060
 But at this point, the police are like, "This guy is dangerous."

542
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
 But he hasn't...

543
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
 This is 1997.

544
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
 Stalker law was different.

545
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,340
 It was very, very hard to get people charged.

546
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,260
 So they said, "Listen, we think this guy is dangerous.

547
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,340
 We're going to put him under a three-day hold."

548
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,500
 Let's see, get him checked out.

549
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,460
 At this point, Steven Spielberg is completely unaware of what's going on back at home.

550
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,540
 He has no idea that...

551
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,000
 And at this point, it's just a guy trying to poke around in the backyard, right?

552
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,360
 And now he said, "I wrote a script about raping a guy and they found razor blades."

553
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,560
 It's alarming, but the police are not really going.

554
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,880
 He hasn't really broken a serious crime yet.

555
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,720
 So Steven Spielberg, who is in Ireland with his family, he gets a phone call from his

556
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
 lawyer.

557
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,960
 His lawyer goes, "Hey, Stevie, there's a little bit of an issue.

558
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,740
 I know you're super busy over there, but we've got a little bit of the issue going on here.

559
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,520
 Local police have contacted me and they've said there's a man who's been trying to get

560
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
 in your house.

561
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,080
 He was calling your dog's jackals and he had some very flattering photos of you, Mr.

562
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 Spielberg.

563
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 I can tell you've been working out."

564
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,820
 And he's like, "What?"

565
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,980
 So Steve, there is an issue.

566
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,780
 This guy is stalking you and we don't know what's going to happen.

567
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,260
 He had these weapons in your car and he's talking about rape and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

568
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,380
 Now Steven Spielberg, he's terrified by this news and I think anyone rightfully would be.

569
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,660
 So I'm just trying to get in your house and talking about raping dudes and stuff like that.

570
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
 He has a family.

571
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,320
 They're all over in Ireland, but the problem is, is that one, he does not want to tell

572
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,760
 his wife about what's going on because she'll panic.

573
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,600
 Two, he, and this is all according to court transcripts.

574
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,080
 He did testify against this guy.

575
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,440
 He couldn't, like when he heard the news, it was shocking to him.

576
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,040
 No, he said no one in my life, no one had ever come into my life to do me or my family

577
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,760
 harm is what he said.

578
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,160
 This was a brand new experience for him and it shocked him.

579
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,200
 He couldn't really talk about it.

580
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,380
 He was super paranoid.

581
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,660
 He didn't know where this guy was.

582
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,780
 He knows that they held him for three days and then they let him go.

583
00:26:51,780 --> 00:27:01,140
 Some stupid security guard told Jonathan that he was in Ireland and, and he gets off the

584
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,300
 phone with his lawyer, click.

585
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,380
 Mr. Spielberg, we're ready to start shooting again, an assistant says.

586
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,300
 And Steven Spielberg walks out of his little office and he's on the set of Saving Private

587
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,920
 Ryan.

588
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:26,520
 He's filming a movie that has hundreds of extras armed with very, very realistic looking

589
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,040
 guns and realistic knives.

590
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,960
 The knives weren't fake and he's has to day in and day out look at this sea of young men.

591
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:43,840
 It would be so easy for this Jonathan guy to get right next to Spielberg.

592
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,220
 Jonathan Spielberg was absolutely in fear for his life.

593
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,380
 He has said, "I honestly believe that had this man had the opportunity he would have

594
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,340
 raped, maimed or killed me."

595
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,580
 He makes no bones about this at all.

596
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,580
 Very, very terrified of him.

597
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
 And he's on the set of a movie.

598
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,260
 I mean, like, he knows seven people by name.

599
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,500
 He knows those seven main actors, but everyone else walking around looking underneath every

600
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
 helmet.

601
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,460
 But he doesn't really even know what the guy looks like either.

602
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,000
 He's never seen him.

603
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,680
 July 18th, Jonathan has picked up for an unrelated parole violation, which I think of anything.

604
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,720
 This is where the cover up, the conspiracy started happening.

605
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,440
 And Spielberg's lawyer says, "Wrap him up and wrap him up for anything you can find."

606
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,040
 And Spielberg's lawyer is calling the mayor of LA.

607
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,560
 Your guys need, your cops need to get this guy in jail, get him out of here.

608
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,200
 And we need to keep this covered up because we do not need this type of publicity.

609
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,920
 So there was a lockdown.

610
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,660
 The police were investigating this behind the scenes.

611
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,860
 But they picked him up for an unrelated parole violation, something super minor.

612
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:51,300
 And then on July 21st, three days later, he issues a full confession.

613
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,100
 Jonathan tells the police, "Listen, one day I was sending it home, everything was totally

614
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
 normal.

615
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,260
 And then for whatever reason, I became, like we all do, I became sexually obsessed with

616
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,980
 Steven Spielberg."

617
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,380
 It was very recent obsession.

618
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,360
 I came up with a goal.

619
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,200
 My goal was to break into his house and rape him.

620
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,120
 But I know that sounds bad, officers, but here's the thing.

621
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,320
 Steven Spielberg wants me to rape him.

622
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,120
 And he, we're going to become gay lovers.

623
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,480
 And the cops go, "Well, he has a wife and a family."

624
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,360
 And Jonathan says, "Well, I'll tell you this, I'm not a monster.

625
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,600
 If I broke into the house and the wife was there, I'd let her watch.

626
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,580
 I'd tie her up, handcuff her, and let her watch me and her husband have butt sex."

627
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,460
 And the cops are just writing down this information and they're like, you know, this is pretty

628
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,580
 disturbing, but at least I don't have to be the guy who's handling the evidence.

629
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,940
 Because what happens is when they do go and start going through all of his stuff, his cars

630
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,860
 and his personal possessions, they find his day planner and it gave them a list on what

631
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,100
 he actually wanted to do.

632
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,240
 Like it goes more in detail like what he was planning and it had a shopping list that included

633
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,840
 items he didn't own these yet, but he needed to pick up some eye masks.

634
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 Blindfolds, right?

635
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 Those are pretty cheap.

636
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,320
 I don't think he was worried about money.

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,080
 I don't think he was like, "I need to go to the dollar store for this stuff."

638
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,000
 Dog collars.

639
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,320
 So maybe like Leading, Steven Spielberg, I don't know.

640
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,280
 And then nipple clamps.

641
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,760
 I hate those.

642
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
 I hate those.

643
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,860
 I don't even like knowing that those exist.

644
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,100
 And then in his possession, they found more addresses of other people in Steven Spielberg's

645
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
 family.

646
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,460
 They found maps of homes.

647
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,840
 They found even more razor blades.

648
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,740
 And they found an article about, according to the legal document, it says in his possession

649
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,980
 was quote, "An article chronicling the stalking conduct of John Lennon's killer."

650
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
 Unquote.

651
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,800
 It was very, very interesting.

652
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,120
 They didn't name John Lennon's killer.

653
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,560
 They just said it was about John Lennon's killer.

654
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,440
 And we all know that Stephen King killed John Lennon.

655
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,400
 So I thought there was an interesting thing of why they just wanted to admit that in

656
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
 the court document.

657
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
 But he gets arrested for stalking.

658
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
 He's getting charged for this.

659
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,280
 And all of this is being kept under wraps.

660
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,960
 Jonathan Norman has been stalking John Doe for a couple weeks.

661
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,840
 And this story finally gets out.

662
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,060
 The LA Times and other newspapers are finally able to break this story.

663
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,980
 But at this time, it's, from what I could tell, all the research I did on this, at this

664
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:39,460
 time it seems like they broke the story either at the end of the trial or after the trial.

665
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,140
 So there was no, there was no media allowed in the courtroom to begin with.

666
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,260
 But there was no, that's why it wasn't a big news story.

667
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,900
 I don't even remember it back then.

668
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,580
 It might have been a blip in the news.

669
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,180
 If the trial was going on and there was news footage of Spielberg in the room being like,

670
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,680
 "No, no, no, no more nipple clamps."

671
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,160
 And they're like, "Exhibit B." And it's like, "This photo of hunky Fabio guy with Steven

672
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,120
 Spielberg's head on the screen, it probably would have been a bigger spectacle."

673
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,920
 But they were able to keep it covered up.

674
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,120
 He was found guilty for this.

675
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,080
 Stalking was the charge.

676
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,800
 And he got 25 years to life.

677
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 Now here's the thing.

678
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,360
 Currently he's at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton.

679
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,840
 And that's where you go for long term or acute medical needs.

680
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,340
 So he could be currently going through something like cancer or something like that.

681
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,980
 Or that could be for medical, like mental medical reasons.

682
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,860
 Because this guy's obviously nuts.

683
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,900
 But this story took place back in 1997.

684
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,780
 It's 25 years next year.

685
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,020
 He's been up for parole since 2019 and he hasn't gotten it yet.

686
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,420
 I checked the inmate locator, he's still there.

687
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,820
 But 25 years is next year.

688
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,720
 And the way that we've seen this, these judges come down really hard when the crime's committed.

689
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,520
 And then like, "Saron, Saron, isn't he walking around now?

690
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,280
 The dude who shot Reagan, I think he's out?"

691
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,160
 Like people who presidential assassins, people who are taking out political figures, murderers,

692
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,040
 have been paroled.

693
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,240
 So who knows if some judge is going to look at this and go, "Oh, he's a good boy.

694
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,600
 He's been really good in prison.

695
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,100
 Let him out."

696
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,360
 Steven Spielberg said about this man, "I think he is on a mission.

697
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,220
 And I don't think he will be satisfied until he accomplishes his mission.

698
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,140
 And I think I am the subject of that mission."

699
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:39,260
 A creepy forgotten true crime story that may become relevant soon.

700
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,540
 If he does get paroled, will he be a good boy and just go back into society he'd be

701
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,780
 in his 50s by now?

702
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,840
 In a job at Kroger supermarket bagging oranges?

703
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,760
 In a job at a magazine doing Photoshop?

704
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 We don't know.

705
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,320
 Will he go back into society?

706
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:03,120
 Or will it just be one more lunatic on the street who's had 25 years to perfect his techniques.

707
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,280
 No more running through backyards, no more just sitting in driveways.

708
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,760
 He's had 25 years talking to other professional convicts and he could be walking free any

709
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,040
 day.

710
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,760
 If someone's after you for revenge or they're mad at you or something like that, a lot of

711
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,180
 times you can wear out that anger.

712
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,040
 You can just avoid the situation, maybe you can talk it out with them, maybe you can both

713
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,860
 be adults, you can talk it out with them.

714
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,600
 Hatred, anger, pain.

715
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,180
 These things fade with time.

716
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,740
 But love is eternal.

717
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,580
 Love never dies.

718
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:56,680
 And if those prison gates ever open and Jonathan Norman walks out of free man, is he going

719
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,640
 to integrate into society?

720
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:07,720
 Or will he start walking down the street whistling a jaunty tune headed towards the Pacific Palisades?

721
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:16,060
 A song in his heart, a skip in his step, and a razor blade in his pocket.
