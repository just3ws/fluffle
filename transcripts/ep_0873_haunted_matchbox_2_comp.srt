1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Is there life after death? This is the question that has plagued humanity since

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,320
 the first dude went "UGHH MY GUTS" and fell down and died. Today we're gonna take a

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,360
 look at two stories that have opposite answers to that question. First off we

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,900
 take a look at the story of a young family who starts renting a house but

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,580
 they have no idea this house is already inhabited by a ghost who can make solid

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:34,760
 objects appear out of thin air. And then we take a look at a scientist who spent

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,460
 his entire life skeptical of the idea of life after death until one day he got

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,980
 sick and died himself only to suddenly be reawaken in a world of endless

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:01:05,100
 jello. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,380
 Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,140
 guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are gonna have a lot of fun this

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,160
 weekend. And this will probably be the last reminder. Next week May 13th I will

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,060
 be in McMinnville Oregon at the McMinnemins UFO Festival. On May 14th I'll

14
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,620
 have a Vinter booth out. We're gonna be handing out stickers and we're gonna

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,540
 have a ball. It's gonna be a lot of fun. If you happen to be traveling through the

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,620
 area swing on by. Say hi to me and then all the other weirdos and freaks that are

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,420
 there talking about UFO stuff. It's really gonna be cool. And the following

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,340
 week there's only gonna be four episodes coming up that week because I do most of

19
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,020
 my production stuff on Saturday. All my research on losing that. To be there

20
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,160
 and to be meeting people. Maybe meeting you. Who knows. But someone who I'm

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,840
 meeting right now because you're walking into Dead Rabbit Command. Everyone on

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,480
 your feet. Give it up for one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,720
 Sawyer Elliott. Wooo! Yay! He's coming in dressed like a Christmas tree. It's a

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,600
 couple months too late Sawyer. But come on in. Ring them little jingle bells.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,120
 Sawyer you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,600
 support the show financially I totally understand. Just help spread the word

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,820
 about the show. That really really helps out a lot. Now Sawyer let's go ahead and

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,820
 get things started by tossing you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna

29
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,820
 leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're driving all the way out to a house in the

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,460
 middle of nowhere. Now I found this story posted online by someone named

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,740
 Mandans. And Mandans said you know this didn't happen to me. This happened to my

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,300
 friend. This was a story that Mandans has heard. And we don't have a year. We don't

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,720
 have a location which is pretty common for a lot of stories online really. Anyways

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,240
 we're gonna go a couple years ago is when this story reportedly took place.

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,760
 There was a young couple and their dog moved on to this rental property.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
 As they're moving into this new place this young couple they've already had

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,600
 their own share of hardships. The girlfriend let's go ahead and call her

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,320
 Mandy had already had back-to-back miscarriages. And the husband will call

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,440
 him Jack. He probably has some bad stuff happen to him. I mean obviously miscarriages

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,140
 affect both people and the couple but I don't have anything specific for him.

41
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,860
 Maybe he stubbed his toe as he was moving into this house. But this couple

42
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,620
 you know they're getting ready to have a nice fresh start in this brand new

43
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,420
 rental property and they got their dog. We'll call him Rover.

44
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,660
 I don't know why he's trying to talk. He's trying to talk for the very first time.

45
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,920
 They looked at Rover they're like what did he just try saying something and the

46
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,580
 dog's like nope. They're like oh okay. So you got Mandy, Jack and Rover moving into

47
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,520
 this house and almost immediately after starting to live here Mandy starts to

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,840
 have these experiences. It started off with things like feeling her hair being

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,140
 tugged. Huh what? Huh? Who did that? And Jack's like in the other room. Rover's all

50
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,260
 laughing like that dog from those old cartoons. But it's not him. It's not an

51
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,380
 animated dog. It's Rover. Something was pulling her hair and then occasionally

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,220
 she'd be sitting there and something would tickle her feet. Pretty creepy

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,660
 right? She starts going up to her husband and me like Jack, Jack you won't believe

54
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,460
 what just happened. Somebody pulled my hair and it's not the dog. Very

55
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,120
 suspicious of him already. He's trying to build a blimp to enter some sort of

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,220
 race. It's not the dog and then my feet got tickled and you weren't anywhere

57
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,980
 around. I was just sitting here with my shoes off reading a book. Something

58
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,500
 tickled my feet and Jack because of the things that they had been through and

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,340
 the and because specifically because of the things that Mandy had been through

60
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,140
 with the miscarriages he starts to think that it's probably just her

61
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,440
 imagination. Oh you're just imagining physical sensations on your body. You're

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,700
 just imagining your hair being pulled so he doesn't put much stock into it but

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,080
 this happens so much. She starts to say hey we got to move. I'm actually too

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,640
 scared to be here. It's not just by myself. I'll have these sensations while

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,000
 you're in the house. Like we got to move. You know they're renting this property.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,920
 It seems to be a pretty good piece of property so Jack's like listen we're

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,280
 not gonna leave just yet. We're gonna wait until the polder guy sets you on fire and

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,200
 then we'll leave. He goes we're not gonna leave just yet. Let's go ahead and see if

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,180
 your sister wants to move in with us. Maybe that will calm you down because he

70
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,860
 doesn't believe that it's anything ghostly. So anyways the sister does end up

71
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,100
 moving in and one night the three of them are sitting in the living room and

72
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:52,020
 all of a sudden the husband and the sister hear a they hear a very loud

73
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,500
 slap echo through the living room and both of them look around. I mean it's it

74
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,420
 was an audible sound that came into nowhere. The husband and the sister are

75
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,280
 kind of looking around like what in the world caused that and Mandy was sitting

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,240
 there rubbing her forehead and she said as we were all just sitting here an

77
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,000
 invisible force slapped me in the forehead and now everyone had had a bit of

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
 an experience. I mean she got slapped. She was the one who got assaulted but the

79
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,640
 husband and the sister knew something was in the house now because they clearly

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,760
 heard the slap and there was nothing there to make the slap. I mean sure

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,380
 there was sure there were six hands in there but none of them slapped Mandy

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,700
 and she didn't slap herself. So the very next day the husband calls up the

83
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,740
 landlord and says listen. It's gonna sound super weird but my wife keeps

84
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,580
 getting tickled and my wife keeps getting tickled. Oh man my wife's getting

85
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,620
 tickled and my wife's getting her hair pulled and then you know last night we

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,700
 all heard a loud slap and my wife got slapped in the face by something so she's

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,520
 ready to leave. Like is there something we need to know about and then the

88
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,560
 landlord on the phone goes "Uhhh... Uhhh... Yes yes I was afraid this day would come."

89
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,080
 The tickling, the hair pulling, the slapping of women. Oh it reminds me of a

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,880
 memory I thought I had gotten past. You see seven years ago I used to live in

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,780
 that property but I moved away. Obviously I'm not there right now. The landlord

92
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,420
 jumps out of the closet and he's like "surprise I wasn't when he slapped your

93
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:44,460
 wife." The landlord goes "I moved away because seven years ago my own son Matthew

94
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:52,220
 drowned on that property. He died and knowing how precocious my five-year-old

95
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,940
 son Matthew was I'm sure that's him. He's probably his ghost running around

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:08,920
 slapping your wife, tickling your wife, pulling her hair." So... wait wait wait what?

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,680
 What? You're telling me your dead kid might be here beating up my wife. The

98
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,080
 landlord goes "probably like that's that's my best guess right when I lived

99
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,460
 there there was no ghosts my son died now there's a ghost it's probably how it

100
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,360
 worked out and the landlord begins yelling over the phone and he says quote

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,420
 "Matthew if you're here stop playing tricks on this poor woman you're scaring

102
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:40,200
 her." The the abuse stopped. Hair pulling and tickling and I wouldn't really

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,780
 classify as abuse I guess if you didn't want it it would be abuse. Obviously

104
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,020
 slapping someone in the head you shouldn't be doing that ghost or

105
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,480
 otherwise but after the dad was like Matthew I told you once I told you a

106
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,160
 million lifetimes quit slapping people after the landlord yelled at his son

107
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,880
 over the phone the physical abuse stopped but the haunting never stopped as long

108
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,880
 as they lived there and they lived there for a few more years they begin to

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,360
 encounter all this other activity. Some of them is pretty benign right and you

110
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,260
 could chalk it up to other things like the toilets would flush on their own you

111
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,860
 know whatever that's cool like maybe it's like a plumbing issue and or maybe

112
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,260
 it's a helpful ghost you're sitting there you're going to the bathroom and

113
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,340
 you're like "phew I better flush the toilet" and then before you can flush it

114
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,220
 it flushes itself. "Thank you five-year-old boy who just watched me

115
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,980
 defigate you've done your duty" and they hear a little voice go "he he he duty"

116
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,280
 actually another thing about it that would be quite terrifying I don't know

117
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,320
 if it was flesh in the toilet while it's all they're taking a shower and he's

118
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
 flushing the toilet they're like "ah I don't know if it was flushing the toilet

119
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,960
 while they were sitting on the toilet because that would be creepy right to

120
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,380
 think that there was a ghost I guess I wait if you live on at house you have to

121
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,920
 make the assumption that while you are doing anything there is a specter of a

122
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,000
 bloodied woman standing in the corner watching you do it I just I think that's

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,860
 probably I think it's probably fair to assume anywhere you go so be on your best

124
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,860
 behavior even at your home there might be some woman standing there in a

125
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,860
 stained old ripped-up wedding gown with her face clawed off by her own fingernails

126
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,380
 and she's watching you play Minecraft for nine hours no that that is probably

127
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:35,260
 happening at some point but Matthew is not only flushing toilets he also would

128
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,360
 play with their dog so remember Rover he's still a part of the story he rovers

129
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,600
 running up and down the hallway sometimes and the two sisters and the

130
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,160
 husband would kind of be like what that's weird Rover would run up and down the

131
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,480
 hallway and they said the way that he was running was like someone was running

132
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,040
 alongside him playing with him hey this way Rover wee

133
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,360
 no let's go back the other end of this hallway I'm a dog I'm an idiot even I

134
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,900
 think this is boring ghosts is like wee it's just like a three-foot hallway they

135
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,900
 just run it back and forth Rover's like and so all that stuff is interesting

136
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,900
 right no not really you're like I guess it's mildly interesting I don't know if

137
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,180
 it's really worthy of a Friday episode but this is why I really wanted to cover

138
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,820
 this the toilets flushing the plane with the dog getting slapped by a ghost this

139
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,100
 is why I really wanted to cover this one day the young couple was sitting in

140
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:44,720
 their living room and all of a sudden a matchbox car rolled down the hallway and

141
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:54,360
 Jake and Mandy look at each other and they go we don't own any matchbox cars

142
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,520
 do we they didn't have been wondering about a story if they're like oh yeah I

143
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,500
 want a bunch of matchbox cars and the sister was playing with them they didn't

144
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,220
 have any kids at this time they owned no matchbox cars but here was a matchbox

145
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,940
 car rolling down the hallway and I think the implication is that the ghost

146
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,900
 manifested it which is one of the most curious things I've always found about

147
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,140
 some ghost stories and it seems to always be brushed over there's a lot of

148
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,540
 times you hear about phantom coins like people in haunted houses hearing coins

149
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,380
 drop and they turn around and there's a coin on the ground we covered a story

150
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,360
 like that on the show or I mentioned it on an offhand comment before it's a

151
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,720
 weird subset of hauntings physical manifestation of an inanimate object

152
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,340
 that remains behind that's magic like ghosts are one thing you can explain

153
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,200
 ghosts away in a bunch of different ways but if things are manifesting out of

154
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,240
 reality now we've crossed fully into the world of sorcery and you would think how

155
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,680
 come we don't look more into that how come that's not a bigger mainstay of

156
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,780
 ghost stories physical pennies dropping out of the sky in haunted houses again

157
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,460
 that's it's common and you think that would be a place you would just be like

158
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,380
 come you know you know you just bring a couple buckets you're like ah now I'm

159
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,500
 gonna make all my I'm gonna make my riches one ghost penny at a time and

160
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,060
 you figure you could take this matchbox car right I would try to find out like

161
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,880
 when it was manufactured like was it like the Batmobile little matchbox car

162
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,120
 from the newest Batman movie like because there's so many weird ways you could

163
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,640
 look at this like if the kid has access to he's dead right he's a dead kid maybe

164
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,120
 he has access to all matchbox cars past present and future because it wouldn't

165
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,240
 matter to him right he's just like sitting at home he's like oh that dog is so

166
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,120
 boring and he starts floating around and where did he get it from did he go to a

167
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,620
 toys RS and he's like you're linking takes them off the shelf and that's why

168
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,020
 when this is my new conspiracy when you go to a toy store department store and

169
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,980
 you find a package just empty like the package is there but the item is empty

170
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,100
 ghost it's ghosts it's not shoplifters it's ghost like where did he get the car

171
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,700
 was it a car from his original collection that he played with that he

172
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:19,340
 manifested into reality was it a car that he found in his ghostly travels around

173
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,640
 he's not Casper but I don't know how else to explain that he's floating down to

174
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,760
 the local Walmart and checking out the toys or was it a car that was even ever

175
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,880
 made by matchbox was this car actually produced because the thing is when they

176
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,960
 find the pennies pennies are pretty obviously have dates on them matchbox

177
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,000
 cars have dates on them as well but you know maybe they didn't pick it up and

178
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,440
 look at it if you saw me you look at it it's like the year 3022 who knows I

179
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,180
 there's so many ways you can look at this how did the matchbox car get there

180
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:59,260
 why did he choose that car and we're all talking about the reasoning why how did

181
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,520
 he make the car appear in ghost stories we all and I've never taken it for

182
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,180
 granted I remember hearing about ghost coins a long time ago and I go this is

183
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,260
 this should be studied way more phantom coins money coming out of nowhere are

184
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,040
 they making the money or are they stealing the money from somewhere else like

185
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,400
 did the penny have to be minted and then he's taking the penny from someone's

186
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,840
 person dropping it on your head in the haunted house and it really opens up a

187
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,680
 whole door to like the law of attraction imagine if you could corral 20

188
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,520
 ghosts and some sort of like call center right and you just make them

189
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,480
 constantly make matchbox cars you get a bunch of ghosts of kids they're like oh

190
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,260
 I just want to see my mom you're like you can see your mom when she dies and until

191
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,180
 then you're sitting in my call center and you're gonna make matchbox cars for

192
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,060
 me and they're just sitting there like and they're mentally creating toys from

193
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,620
 their childhood and then I take them down to like collector shop antique

194
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,540
 roadshow stuff like that and they're like whoa how did you get this original

195
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,260
 raggedy Andy doll this thing's like in mint condition and then I look at the

196
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,500
 camera don't look in my basement there's a lot of dead kids in there be around

197
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,640
 and then I get possessed by all the kids my body before that happens for that

198
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,520
 nonsense happens I wonder if you could industrialize basically let me let me

199
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,640
 say what I want to say but I'm trying to avoid what if you can industrialize

200
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,760
 dead children to manifest objects that then you can resell now that I think

201
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,440
 about it who wants to buy much stupid matchbox cars I have I have like a

202
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,740
 little I have like a little toy stand outside my house and I'm selling the

203
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,020
 matchbox cars for a dollar each the neighborhood kids and kids are coming by

204
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,140
 to buy them I'm like you don't happen to be sick you look kind of sick they're

205
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,020
 like no I'm feeling good you're like oh man I bet you really like matchbox cars

206
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,180
 don't you I bet you can make all the matchbox cars in the world they're like

207
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,560
 ah running away so yeah it's weird it's weird my weird money-making idea but how

208
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,420
 do ghosts manifest though from this fairly mundane haunting right it's just a

209
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,760
 poltergeist is just someone who's kind of messing around we have to look at the

210
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,640
 theory that ghosts can create things out of nothing and that goes beyond ghost

211
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,480
 powers like knocking on walls and flushing toilets and flicking lights and

212
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,480
 standing in the corner while you're taking a shower all that creepy stuff

213
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,400
 that's creepy stuff but the fact that they can actually manifest stuff out of

214
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,880
 nothing who's to say you can't be sitting in your house one day and that bloody

215
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,500
 woman in the corner of your room gets so tired of you she manifests the bullet

216
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,900
 right into your heart and then she manifests the suicide note what that'd

217
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,860
 be super crazy right that'd be insane and then you're standing there next to her

218
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,420
 all bloody and stuff like that and you're like and now some other guy moves in

219
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,020
 he's like oh what a nice place it's time to sit on my laptop and play Minecraft

220
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,740
 for nine hours and you're like she's just gonna keep doing this so Sawyer

221
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,880
 let's go ahead and be more profound I don't know why it became my slave labor

222
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,480
 camp I was really gonna focus just on the fact that you can manifest stuff but

223
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,160
 Sawyer Elliott let's get us out of here get us out of this ghost suicide pact

224
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,800
 we're leaving behind this house we're waving goodbye to little ghost kid

225
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:27,680
 we're headed all the way out to Lynchburg Virginia and there's a man his

226
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,340
 name is dr. even Alexander and he's a neurosurgeon he works on people's

227
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,260
 brains and one day he's sitting there in the operating room and he's like oh do

228
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,680
 this guy's brain it's like totally nuts but I gotta heal it give me some of that

229
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,460
 needles and thread he's like so he's also in the brain together he's like there

230
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,820
 it goes nice and smooth they're like doctor no he's working on people's

231
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,420
 brains and stuff like that and he saves this guy puts his skull back on and the

232
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,740
 guy sits up goes thanks doc he's like you betcha that's what I do I save people's

233
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,720
 brains and then as he's walking out of the operating theater this young nurse

234
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,120
 walks up to him she goes dr. even Alexander that was so cool how you

235
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,520
 didn't let that guy die the other doctor just loves to kill people that's so

236
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,800
 cool how you didn't let that guy die but doctor what do you think what happened

237
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,600
 if he had died doctor even Alexander goes hmm I've thought about this a lot

238
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,440
 because my job it makes me focus on life and death one wrong stitch one wrong

239
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,660
 needle into the brain he's so sad with sewing the brain together one wrong

240
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,220
 twist of my wrist and that guy could be dead and I think there's probably nothing

241
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,740
 after life right it's probably something that when you die your brain is flooded

242
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,780
 with chemicals and you just dream of something that's where all these so

243
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,940
 called near-death experiences happen and this was kind of his view for around

244
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,880
 25 years he worked in the industry for 25 years but on November 10th 2008 he

245
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,120
 wakes up and he's like oh my back oh dude this totally sucks and as he's like

246
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,600
 complaining about how bad his back hurts his brain starts to hurt too no I

247
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,120
 need that I need that to work and he's has this splitting headache the worst

248
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,240
 headache he's ever had in his life severe back pain and he's like oh dude I

249
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,400
 must be super sick with like the flu or something right because apparently he's

250
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,900
 not apparently he's not a regular doctor knows those aren't flu symptoms he's

251
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,900
 like maybe I just have the flu I'm gonna go back to sleep and his wife's like okay

252
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,460
 honey but remember you have that brain operation soon he's like I'll do it later

253
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,460
 he falls asleep a couple hours later his wife comes in to wake him up for that

254
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,500
 brain thing he's supposed to be doing and she can't wake him up she's like even

255
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:47,180
 even wake up bro wake up dude and he's just all and that's when she calls 911

256
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,360
 he's all convulsing and stuff and his eyes have rolled back into his head she's

257
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,880
 like oh no so she calls 911 ambulance shows up they throw him on a gurney and

258
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,400
 he's all convulsing they're like strapping him down they're like I know

259
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,600
 this guy this is dr. even Alexander he's the best brain surgeon he's the best

260
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,000
 brain surgeon I know and I only know one we must save this guy's life so they're

261
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,640
 taking him to the hospital it turns out he didn't have the flu right anyone

262
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
 would have known that if you have a horrible backache and the worst

263
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,460
 take ever probably not the flu he had bacterial meningitis it's this virus

264
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,820
 that was eating at his brain and he goes to hospital and they're like dude this

265
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,300
 dude is toast like even if we save him this virus has been eating so much on

266
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,980
 his delicious brain that he'll probably be a vegetable but we'll try to do that

267
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,900
 miss Alexander we'll try to save him and so they put him in a medically induced

268
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:50,720
 coma now on dr. even side this is what happened and obviously this is where you

269
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,040
 do get a lot of skeptics to say well you know it's all the chemicals and stuff

270
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,320
 they're bumping into your body and all the stuff the body's naturally doing plus

271
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,680
 he did have a brain-eating virus that's probably not gonna help your

272
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:08,360
 cognitive skills but what dr. even saw was he was no longer dr. even Alexander

273
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:22,060
 he died and was in this dark underground place his form his his essence was

274
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:28,260
 trapped in Jell-O and he's just sitting there completely surrounded by Jell-O

275
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,740
 in a pitch black underground cavern now he says I don't know how I knew it was

276
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,440
 underground I just felt that it was underground but I'm sitting there and

277
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:47,160
 I'm completely coiled up in this sea of Jell-O he goes I couldn't talk he says

278
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:55,600
 nothing was in focus I couldn't see I had no memories before being inside the

279
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,480
 Jell-O and I had no idea of a sense of self I didn't know I was an individual

280
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:12,140
 I was truly a blank slate I didn't know who I was or where I was or how I was

281
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,900
 and none of that mattered to me I was in the Jell-O he said there were these

282
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,700
 black roots surrounding him as he's just sitting there in this war I'm trying

283
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,660
 to think of another word for Jell-O as he's sitting there in this warm Jell-O

284
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,140
 he's sitting there in this warm Jell-O-Ton and he has his quote about it

285
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,720
 because he's been telling people about this he goes I died I died and I ended

286
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,160
 up in the next life and I had no memories and no sense of who I was I was

287
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,320
 just this new thing and people go that sounds horrible you're just like trapped

288
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,920
 in this place and you don't know who you are or why you are you have no idea

289
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,800
 about your family you don't remember anything and he has this quote he goes

290
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,560
 quote people think going through this experience in this state of almost

291
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,580
 amnesia must have been very horrific and yet I knew nothing else is a

292
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:12,820
 possibility and therefore to me it all just seemed natural this was existence

293
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,380
 that's a really interesting quote because again if I conch you over the

294
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,420
 head right now with a billy club and me and that bloody ghost dragged you out

295
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,020
 of your house and I took you underground and poured Jell-O all over you and then

296
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,400
 you woke up right because you would know oh no I have a family I'm gonna be late

297
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,480
 to work and I'm allergic to Jell-O he starts swelling up but if you didn't

298
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,640
 know anything other than the Jell-O then why would you be scared you would have

299
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,320
 no idea that there was a life outside of this Jell-O prison underground really

300
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,040
 really interesting way to look at it and then this is so this is super

301
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,100
 interesting so we have I love that detail to this the idea that when you

302
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,460
 die you can end up in a place and not know anything of life so there's no

303
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,260
 mourning there's no loss you just simply are as unique as that experience is

304
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:16,380
 what's interesting is then it transfers into a very very by the book life after

305
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,620
 death experience it's so basic there's a gate that shows up there's this

306
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,120
 beautiful music playing and he's like floating through the Jell-O and then

307
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,880
 he's taken to a paradise where marshmallow clouds of pink and white are

308
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,160
 slowly gliding over a valley and then like there's a bunch of people in

309
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,840
 peasant clothes dancing around come on over here over here take a bath take a

310
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,080
 bath get the Jell-O off you and then come over here and then he climbs on

311
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,600
 top of a butterfly and he's like flying around on a butterfly and then there's

312
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,320
 like this beautiful woman sitting next to him she's like you're loved you're

313
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,660
 loved here really basic life after death obviously to him this was a life

314
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,860
 change and experience I kind of glossed over it because we've covered stuff like

315
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,140
 that before and even if you've never listened to that show before that's the

316
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,700
 standard life after death story right where you're walking a paradise there's

317
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,980
 people in peasant clothes you feel like this joyous acceptance and everything

318
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,540
 like that but the opening where he's in the Jell-O I find absolutely fascinating

319
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,260
 I've never heard anything like that before with a life after death experience

320
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,640
 that I can recall the second the middle part is a little boring it's a little

321
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,240
 redundant blowing around paradise with a butterfly but then it ends with all of a

322
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,320
 sudden paradise is replaced with pitch blackness an infinite dark void and in

323
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:42,120
 the center of it is a bright pulsating light and he's looking at it and he

324
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,860
 realizes that this is the creator this is the person who created everything and

325
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,340
 it is at this point when he remembers who he is even when he was in paradise

326
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,740
 climb on the back of a butterfly he's like is his family's mourning him he's

327
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,620
 in the hospital he doesn't even know his family exists when he's in this black

328
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,900
 void that's when he goes oh I have a family like I have people who love me

329
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,700
 back on earth and I have co-workers and stuff like that and I have that brain

330
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,980
 surgery to do and I have family members and stuff like that and then he remembers

331
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,880
 his life on earth for the first time and then he sees five faces appear in the

332
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,800
 darkness and they all have this concerned look for him and he wakes up comes out of

333
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,960
 this he does have a long recovery it takes two weeks for his brain to even

334
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,440
 start to fully function he's just laying there for a while but he doesn't make it

335
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,240
 and when his brain is finally fully healed and he's opening his eyes he's

336
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,480
 able to interact with the world he realizes because people are coming in to

337
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,820
 visit him he realizes that four of the faces he saw in the darkness were family

338
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,780
 members you didn't recognize them at first but now that he's seeing them in

339
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,220
 the hospital room he's like you were there and you were there and you were

340
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,340
 there he goes but there is a fifth face and I don't know who that was and

341
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,300
 apparently what he says was he found out later there was a relative of his who

342
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,260
 claims to have psychic powers and they were trying to contact him

343
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,880
 telepathically while he was in his coma it wasn't there in the room but was

344
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,480
 somewhere else trying to telepathically contact him a fascinating story

345
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,040
 fascinating story doesn't like the wizard of Oz that's true but we have this idea

346
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,080
 the really the most fascinating part was the beginning the rest of this story

347
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,360
 about miraculous life after death I'm like boring get back to the Jell-O the

348
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,460
 idea of paradise being there we've covered that before find that very

349
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,700
 fascinating the idea though of not knowing who you are when you are dead is

350
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:52,900
 infinitely fascinating to me because that goes against what most major religions

351
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,900
 preach at least the Western religions right you you are reunited with your

352
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,780
 loved ones in the afterlife but if you I mean I guess eventually he was right he

353
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,840
 was running around I maybe his loved ones also flying around dragon flies are

354
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,120
 playing jobs and you're like a John fly away and you're a little slow butterfly

355
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:20,000
 the idea that you can not know the idea that you exist here and you learn and

356
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,240
 you grow as a person and then when you die you basically forget all that stuff

357
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,080
 and you're in this such a natural state and everything's wiped clean is

358
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,180
 fascinating and a little terrifying I'm not gonna not gonna lie like I think

359
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,780
 that's why I kind of glommed onto that that's terrifying state but if that's

360
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,140
 all you knew right this is all we know that's what's so fascinating about life

361
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,620
 and life after death we don't know what happens after you die I think there's a

362
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,900
 common some people go I don't know and they literally mean they don't know like

363
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,180
 they don't know if there's life after death but people like me I do believe in

364
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,820
 life after death I will also say I don't know because it's such a weird question

365
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,840
 if someone asks what do you think happens to us after we die I will say I

366
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,280
 don't know but the full answer is I believe we go somewhere but I don't

367
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,800
 know what it is or what that experience will be like will there be gravity in

368
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,920
 paradise will there be enough butterflies for everyone or will some

369
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,120
 people get stuck with caterpillars and they're just going they're just riding

370
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,720
 that caterpillar around who knows like that's the thing when I say I don't know

371
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,560
 I'm talking about the specifics and I think a lot of people when you ask them

372
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,100
 what do you think happens to you when you die I think a lot of people when they

373
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,220
 say I don't know they mean the specifics they're not talking about the big

374
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,860
 question about life after death this is really fascinating and there's actually

375
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,740
 been a big push lately I've been seeing more and more of these articles

376
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,180
 psychology today just ran a big article on Monday about how it is obvious that

377
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,100
 there is life after death there has been so many accounts of people having these

378
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,660
 experiences and you can caught you can keep saying well it's just the chemicals

379
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,840
 firing in your brain you can keep saying that over and over and over and over and

380
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,720
 over again but that is that really the answer is that really the answer and

381
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,720
 what's interesting is they say people who are not religious have these

382
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,680
 experiences people who did not believe in life after death before this

383
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,360
 experience afterwards said like was like a huge conversion right a huge amount of

384
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,960
 people say no it's obvious there's life after death and what I thought was so

385
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,940
 interesting they did this study and that's what this psychology today

386
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,940
 article was referencing one of the things that constantly popped up in this

387
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,260
 study was when people die and have these experiences these near-death experiences

388
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:46,340
 they almost always say the world I went to was the real world like it felt more

389
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,740
 real than anything I've ever experienced here that was a common refrain when I

390
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:59,840
 died it felt like I woke up it felt like that was reality and this is a place

391
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,400
 we're at while we're learning things or a place that we're at while we're

392
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,120
 killing time together that's so interesting that that was a common

393
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:17,720
 statement when I died I went to the real place I was home there that's where

394
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,960
 I'm supposed to be as they're doing the interview they're like you have any

395
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,900
 cyanide on you or maybe I don't know like is this building on the tenth story a

396
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:31,420
 lot of people are saying that that was realer than anything here in reality

397
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:39,380
 fascinating way to think about it and again tying it in with the ghost story

398
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:46,180
 and we'll wrap it up like this which one is accurate how can you have both how

399
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,360
 can you have a soul die like a young boy drown and then his ghost trapped on

400
00:32:52,360 --> 00:33:01,280
 earth and then this doctor have a brain disease and go to paradise like how well

401
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,960
 how do the physics of ghost work we've talked about that a lot on this show and

402
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,720
 it's a question that I'll always wonder not gonna talk about slave labor camps

403
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,260
 for kid ghosts again but I'm talking about why are some people ghosts and

404
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:19,400
 some people go to paradise I don't understand I mean you can look at it

405
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,740
 from a religious perspective right you could say well maybe Dr. even Alexander

406
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,460
 followed this religion maybe the five-year-old boy was a dirty heathen

407
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,480
 but I don't think it's that because you do have people that of all religions that

408
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,260
 end up as ghosts and then you have people of all religions or no religion go to

409
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,420
 paradise have these visions or go to these places a place realer than the

410
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:49,420
 real world how do you get slotted into what how do you I think it'd be dope to

411
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,020
 be a ghost honestly for a while but I want to want to do it for like six seven

412
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,860
 thousand years right but to be honest I think paradise would get a little boring

413
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,820
 after six or seven thousand years fascinating story what happens to you

414
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,020
 after you die my answer is something happens to you but whether you become a

415
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,740
 ghost or you go to paradise or what paradise is like whether you're reincarnated

416
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:23,420
 or sit next to the creator I don't know I don't know the specifics I it's so

417
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,140
 bizarre to me that you can either end up in an endless sea of jello and then

418
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,580
 dance with other joyous humans in this lush verdant valley and then hit your

419
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,300
 ride on a butterfly wing on your way to meet the Creator of the universe that's

420
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:44,860
 one option the other option is you're a lonely ghost a little boy in a house just

421
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:50,380
 sitting there that when a young couple moves in you get so excited you start

422
00:34:50,380 --> 00:35:00,260
 teasing the mom you just want some affection you just want some love why is

423
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,540
 the little boy ghost trapped here and Dr. even Alexander went to paradise and

424
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:12,460
 came back a true mystery it's the one question the one mystery that someday

425
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:20,500
 we will all solve on our own we will all know the truth of life after death sooner

426
