1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 President Biden and Vladimir Putin meet up at the G7 meeting.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
 Or did they?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,400
 And then we take a look at the story of Max Kramer,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,000
 a homeless video game designer who believes that he's trapped in the Matrix.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 And that is the most sane part of Max Kramer, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, our newest Patreon supporter.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 Everyone give a round of applause to Phil Miles.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,600
 Yay! Everyone give a round of applause. He's doing little bowels and stuff like that.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 Phil, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
 Just help spread the word about the show.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 Really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 Phil, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you a brand new set of keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 We are headed out to the G7 meeting in wherever that was held at.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
 I didn't put in my notes.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 [Demonic sound]

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is flying somewhere where they held the G7 meeting.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 I'm assuming Switzerland, Norway, some nice country, right?

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 It's not in Czechoslovakia. Unless you're listening from Czechoslovakia, then that's the best country ever.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 We're at the G7 meeting. It's June 16th, 2021.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 And you guys say, Jason, wait a second. How are you gonna report on this story if you don't even know where it takes place?

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Well guys, I don't need facts.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 I just need the news.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,600
 Because this story is from our favorite website, Real Raw News.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 This is where we don't even have to worry about things like information.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 We don't have to worry about who, what, when, where, why, how.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 That's for the lame stream media.

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
 Real Raw News serves it undercooked and not ready to eat.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 You still have to cook it a little bit more. But we're not gonna.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,600
 President Biden was at the G7 meeting and he was there to meet Vladimir Putin and some other dudes, some other world leaders.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,600
 I don't know, the guy from France, Macron.

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 There's probably like someone from Australia, right?

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 Probably walks in. They're late.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 Because it took so long to get from the other side of Flat Earth.

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 And then there's like, who's the lady in Germany, Merkel.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 But Real Raw News gives us all we need.

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
 G7, President Biden's there, or is he?

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 Because I know you guys watch all the video clips. President Biden there.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 But that wasn't really him. According to Real Raw News.

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
 This is mind-blowing. I don't understand why they're not covering this.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 Real Raw News reveals the truth. President Biden was not at the G7 meeting.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 The reason why was because he had a horrible stroke and he's paralyzed from the waist down.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,600
 Let me back up here for a second. I want you guys to be fully aware if you're listening to the show for the first time.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 I don't believe that, okay? I don't want someone to be like, wait a second.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:13,600
 No, but Real Raw News, I'm just reporting the realest rawest news. So if you see Biden walking around, if you see Biden mobile, it's not President Biden.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 And you go, oh, is it a clone? Because we have all this cloning technology.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
 Like, weren't they chasing around Hillary Clinton's clone recently? It's not a clone.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 You go, well, it must be like a hologram then. Because I saw that video on YouTube of Obama and Bush and some other president who's standing there.

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,600
 And I saw him and he was a hologram. No. It's not a clone, even though we supposedly have that technology.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 It's not a hologram, even though we have this technology. What it is, it's not a clone. It's not a hologram. It's a body double.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 They have a life-like Joe Biden mask that this guy puts on and then he walks around and he does presidential stuff.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 Now, recently we covered a story from also Real Raw News where the Navy SEALs were hunting down Nancy Pelosi and it was also, it was a woman just wearing a very realistic Nancy Pelosi mask.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 Well, apparently they also have one of these for Joe Biden. He's not clone worthy. He's not hologram worthy.

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 They just take some dude and go, ah, wear this rubbery old man mask. So Joe Biden is actually a man in a mask. Who you ask, right?

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,600
 No one's asking that because no one's believing it, but they actually give us the answer in Real Raw News.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 This is what I find so fascinating about made-up news like this. Like, you could easily just go, that wasn't really Joe Biden.

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 He had a stroke. He's paralyzed from the waist down. So they hired some guy to pretend to be Joe Biden with a mask.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 And people are just going to nod their heads and go, that's stupid. That's stupid. I'm totally going to believe in that.

65
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
 That is so far-fetched, I will believe in that. Some lies, you just make them brief.

66
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Not Real Raw News. That's why they worked for this cutting-edge journalism company. They'd fire me on the spot.

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 No, it's not just that they hired some 82-year-old guy. They hired 82-year-old actor Arthur Roberts.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 So who's Arthur Roberts though? Let's all pretend that we're idiots and we want to know who Arthur Roberts is.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 According to Real Raw News, he is, this is his claim to fame, was portraying the evil ninja, Brayden, in the 1983 martial arts film, Revenge of the Ninja.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 So I go, wait a second. This is a real guy? This is a real guy? They actually found, they actually went to IMDB and found a guy.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,600
 They found an old man, a real dude, and say, this is Joe Biden. Just make it up. Just make it up. Say he was working in the community theater or something.

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,600
 You don't even have to give his name. But this information is so specific, you can go to this guy's IMDB page.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,600
 But I went and I looked at some of the other roles he was in, because if this guy's actually portraying the 46th president of the United States,

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 he better have more on his resume than evil ninja, or he was the evilest ninja in the movie. But he was in Red Alert, Command and Conquer, sorry, sorry, Video Game Nerds.

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:17,600
 Sorry, Command and Conquer, Red Alert. He was General Gunter von Eastling. So there we go. If you guys remember that full motion video game, he was the blurry guy in the green outfit.

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 He was also in a movie called Hammerhead, which I saw. Let me read you the description of Hammerhead, because you may be thinking it's about a shark.

77
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,600
 You're right, you're right. You think it's about a hammerhead shark? I thought this was the greatest description of a movie ever.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 A scientist tries to save his son from, this is from IMDB. I'm not making this up. I didn't add any words.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 A scientist tries to save his son from cancer, but his experiments turn him into a shark man instead.

80
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 It wasn't terrible. Jeffrey Combs was in it. He's my favorite actor, but also President Biden. President Biden was in Hammerhead.

81
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,600
 He was also in, here's some great movies that our current president is in, because he's acting president now.

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 He was in Countess Dracula's Orgy of Blood, The Erotic Adventures of the Invisible Man, and finally, my favorite of these, Scared Topless.

83
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 So I have to say, I've never been more excited for a Biden presidency in my life.

84
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 Like at first, you know, on the national stage, the national politics, I'm always like, I don't think they really have much power.

85
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 There's stuff behind the scenes. I'm more of a local politics guy. This is awesome. This is awesome.

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 Now when I see President Biden, I'm going to have to watch The Erotic Adventures of the Invisible Man, which I read the description for that movie.

87
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,600
 It's what you would think. It's about a guy who turns invisible and starts pinching women's butts.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 So there we go. And let me add this too. So here's the always a thing with like body doubles, right?

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 That you could take me and I could be changed with like Alex Jones or something like that.

90
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 But we have obvious physical differences, right? It wouldn't work, right? You could obviously scow. That's weird.

91
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 Alex Jones, he's differently shaped. That's always the issue with these things.

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
 Now again, this is what I don't understand if you're making it up. Why would you make up this detail?

93
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 Just don't just don't tell me this detail at all. I never would have asked this.

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 Let me read you this quote. This is from Real Raw News because Joe Biden is six feet tall.

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 But Arthur Roberts, the star of Skeered Toppolis, is six foot two. Why they picked a man who was too much taller?

96
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 Who knows? But here's this quote in Real Raw News. I love this quote.

97
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 Although Roberts IMDb page lists his height at six foot two. In 1995, he suffered a severe spinal.

98
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 Why? Why include this detail? I never would have asked. I never would have asked.

99
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,600
 Although Roberts IMDb page lists his height at six foot two.

100
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 In 1995, he suffered a severe spinal compression injury that reduced his height by approximately two inches.

101
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 Did Bugs Bunny hit him with a mallet? How could you imagine an accident so intense that you get hit so hard with something that you're at the doctor's office

102
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 and you stand up and you raise your head? What's that doorframe? You must have really tall doors here.

103
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 The doorframe is like two inches taller than it and they're like, "Arthur, I hate to tell you, I hate to tell you, but Wiley Coyote dropped that anvil on your head. You're two inches shorter."

104
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 Why include a detail like that? Just make the dude up. Make the dude up.

105
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 This is what drives me nuts about these stories. And if that is true, I'm so sorry to this guy. I can't imagine getting hit with something so heavy that I shrink.

106
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 He has an accordion body. You see Joe Biden kind of bouncing around when he walks.

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 This story, when I checked this yesterday, I found this story yesterday, 43,000 visits to this story. Real raw news is not an obscure website.

108
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 I mean, maybe in the mainstream, 43,000 views, it was published on the 16th. I was reading it on the 19th. So it's getting over 10,000 views a day.

109
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 And the comments are like, "Yeah, Biden sucks." All that stuff is just, they believe it. They believe that the star of Swimsuit the Movie is the President of the United -- or pretending to be the President of the United States.

110
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:07,600
 It's so fascinating to me. It's so fascinating to me. They overdo their fan fiction. They overdo this narrative.

111
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 I do want to see these movies now, though. I am going to have to watch The Erotic Adventures of the Invisible Man.

112
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 I've actually seen him in a couple movies because long-time listeners of the show know I watch a lot of sci-fi channel movies.

113
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 He was in a movie called Gargoyle. It was okay. He was in Curse of the Komodo, which was actually pretty good. I actually really liked that movie.

114
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:37,600
 And he did a really good job in that movie. He was an evil scientist who created these giant Komodos, Komodo dragons, and they were trapped on the island.

115
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 I remember it vividly. It was an entertaining sci-fi channel movie. These giant, intelligent Komodos, Curse of the Komodo. Ted Rabbit recommends Curse of the Komodo.

116
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 Anyways, Phil Miles, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter. We're recording this episode live with the Patreon listeners watching it.

117
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 And Rudy Jazz just informed me the G7 meeting was held in Cornwall, and that is in England. So there you go. That's a good reason why I do these episodes live.

118
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 Phil Miles, I'm going to give you the keys to the Carbentercopter. We're leaving behind Cornwall. We are headed out to Santa Monica, California.

119
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 [imitates carbenter]

120
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:36,600
 This story was recommended to me by Oogs, and it has been both a blessing and a curse because he has shown me a website. It's a very, very rare type of view into a insane mind.

121
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 We run into this all the time, incomprehensible madness. Stuff like Time Cube, where it's just all of these rantines and stuff about the way the Earth is a square or whatever it was. I was never into it. It was incomprehensible.

122
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 And you run into that all the time. You get into gangstalking subreddits. You just read it and you're like, "Where is the swamp? What does this even mean?" It's incomprehensible madness.

123
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 Every show, often, you find someone who has a foot in each world, where not only are they truly, truly by all definition insane, but they're lucid enough to form sentences and to write out a narrative structure.

124
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 It's very, very rare that you come across this.

125
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 I think the most obvious example that we've covered on this show was Steve Lightfoot, who I covered episodes 5 and 6. One of my favorite conspiracies. It's one of the reasons why I started the show was because to document weirdness like his website,

126
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 he believes that Stephen King shot John Lennon and he spent the last 20 years trying to prove it. He has a van that's covered in signs and stickers that say LennonMurderTruth.com. That's the name of his website. I bought his newsletter because I'm so enamored by it.

127
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 It's my second love next to Balloon Boy. I love it.

128
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 I remember just spending hours on his website. This was even before the podcast was started, just reading these rants. These insane rants. The one that struck out to me the most, and I could never find it again. The problem with some of these websites is the links are always broken.

129
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 He had this thing, so he believes that he's going to uncover the John Lennon murder conspiracy.

130
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 I was reading this back like before I started the podcast, so it would have been like 2017. He was reading this post and he goes, "I'm going to expose Stephen King. You guys are all asleep at the wheel. I know Stephen King killed John Lennon. I'm going to expose it."

131
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 There's just page after page after page of that. But he read it through and he goes, "I know that someday I'm going to be on The Tonight Show and I can picture it right now."

132
00:14:49,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 He goes, "Every year on the anniversary where I expose Stephen King, I'll be on The Tonight Show and the audience will clap and they'll cheer for me and I'll walk out on stage. You know what? We'll let Stephen King out of prison.

133
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 Just for this, I'm going to have a cage on wheels and I'm going to roll it out into The Tonight Show set and everyone's going to be clapping and I'm going to do a little bow and the host, I think, was probably Jay Leno at this point.

134
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 He's going to interview me and I'll have the wittiest answers. Then I watched the movie Joker and I was like, "Yeah, when I saw that scene in the Joker where he imagined himself on The Murray Show."

135
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 Yeah, it was so weird. I remember reading that and I thought, "This guy is fully delusional like he thinks it's going to happen." But it's rare. A lot of times you just find insane madness. It's incomprehensible.

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 So a listener named Oogz recently sent me this website that he discovered a long time ago called Immortal Jewish Car Machine.

137
00:15:49,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 The website itself is gone, but luckily, thank God, the Wayback Machine has archived probably about 98% of it. He sent this to me, I think, Tuesday or Wednesday of last week and I've already spent, I don't know, six, seven hours going through it and I'm barely scratching the surface, but I wanted to start sharing the story with you.

138
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 There's going to be more information that's coming out soon. But if you're like chasing the website's been down for like five or six years, yes. But there's so much to go through, I'm sure we're going to discover more.

139
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 I almost feel like an archeologist going through this. Apparently the backstory is Oogz found out about it. He had a friend who worked at a library and every so often this homeless man would come into the library.

140
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 He'd log into the computer, he'd be typing stuff in and chuckling to himself, muttering. He just kind of stood out in the pack. The friend couldn't figure out what he was doing. I mean, he's probably just online looking at porn or something like that, but he was curious.

141
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 One day this homeless man leaves the computer unlogged off.

142
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 So the friend went over there to see what he was on. He's probably porn. It was admin. It was like an admin login for the website Immortal Jewish Car Machine.

143
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 For people who study this type of stuff. This is the equivalent of coming across a lost civilization. Because we're looking at a man who is nuts, but can form sentences that we can all understand.

144
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 And so I think that's enough of an introduction. Let's get into this. What is it? I don't understand what the immortal part is. The immortal Jewish car machine is the website.

145
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 So also he calls it freedom of speech bum. This is what he calls it. But his name is Max Kramer. The website's been offline since about, I want to say 2014, 2016. It's all in the way back machine.

146
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 But let's start the ball rolling on this one. Immortal Jewish car machine. We don't know what the immortal part is. I'm sure it's that at some point.

147
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 Jewish, he is Jewish. He talks about being Jewish all the time. So he's homeless. He's Jewish. We know that stuff about him. His name is Max Kramer. I believe he's at my age.

148
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,600
 And he lives in Santa Monica. I've gotten that much detail clear just from reading random stuff. But the car machine is the most important part of this.

149
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 It's not the most insane, but it's the most important part. Car machine is actually computer assisted reality. This is really the thesis to Max Kramer's vision of the world.

150
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 We live in the matrix. That is old hat. You can find people. You can find top level scientists to believe we probably live in some sort of matrix.

151
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 Us living in the matrix, I wouldn't even waste my time doing an episode on that, right? You're like, "That's my favorite topic." It's just so well known that you hear that all the time we live in a matrix.

152
00:18:46,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 But Max Kramer has some interesting spins on this one. He lives in the matrix. We're all Sims. We're all CGPs or computer generated people.

153
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 There are a few other real humans in the matrix. He calls power players. But for the most part, we're just computer graphic people. We're background noise. We're Sims.

154
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 That is, again, that's a very 18 year old thought process. I'm the only real person. You know what I mean? That's just kind of a baby's first existential crisis type of thing.

155
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,600
 Like maybe I'm the only thing that exists when I die. The universe disappears, stuff like that. That's not out of the ordinary either. Other people believe that.

156
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 He believes he is the only real person, or one of the few real people on the planet. Everyone else is a Sim. Fine.

157
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 This is where we start to go from kind of just a standard conspiracy theory to dangerously insane.

158
00:19:50,600 --> 00:20:10,600
 He has a quote, "Sim Americans are not Americans." You see, because we don't exist, any crime committed against us is not a crime. We are props to him.

159
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Here's another quote from him. "Simulated crime is not a crime because there is no victim."

160
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 You're like, "Okay, this guy has some interesting philosophical things. Let me finish the quote." "Simulated crime is not a crime because there is no victim."

161
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 "No victims," the quote continues, "Lots of fun and no punishment."

162
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 I don't know if he said it that menacingly, but that's who Max Kramer is in a nutshell. He believes that not only do we not exist, but it's fun to torture us.

163
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 But it's when we get into the specifics of the website, like, that's just the overview. And honestly, that's not even the craziest part.

164
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 When you start drilling into the specifics, when you start clicking on the links of things like "deceive" and "be deceived," that's when you get to the "mwah," the pure raw fruit of madness.

165
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 Max Kramer could probably get into a job at Real Raw News because he believes in these things called "lifecast suits."

166
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 It's what it sounds like. It's a suit that you put on that looks exactly like somebody else. So you can imitate them. You can be them.

167
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 That people can buy these suits or make these suits and imitate other people.

168
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 So if you were a homeless man and you lived in a world where you could have a suit that allowed you to disguise yourself, preferably as a non-homeless man, you'd disguise yourself as an even more homeless man.

169
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 If you had the ability, if you were homeless, you had the ability to buy a suit that would make you look like the local shopkeeper or even just a waiter, you could go in there and eat some food, right?

170
00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 That's what you would do. You're like, "Jason, if I was homeless and I could appear like anybody, I'd appear like Joe Biden. I'd go and have a job.

171
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 I would have just become a waiter and eat some soup and be like, "Oh, sci-fi technology is so, so useful.

172
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 Oh, he was a soup now and I got the waiter fired from his job because he was eating soup. He was stealing soup."

173
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,600
 Oh, this sci-fi is so awesome. No, Jason, think higher than that. Well, Max Kramer thought higher than that, too.

174
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 Max Kramer thought higher than that. In his section of his website, Deceive and Be Aceed, he goes through a couple steps on what he would do with a lifecast.

175
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 And also, just in case you're clear on this, you can also get a vocal box transplant.

176
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 And though, say you don't have a lot of money, let's say you're homeless. Let's say, for example, you're homeless, we have this quote here, quote,

177
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 "Amateur lifecast might be able to be made with melted chewing gum and grocery store products."

178
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 He doesn't explain the recipe. He doesn't explain the recipe, but he lets us know that if you have enough melted chewing gum and grocery store products,

179
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 so anything from like a box of tied detergent to beef jerky, you could possibly look like Andy Serkis or something like that.

180
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,600
 That's the guy I choose to be, a man who becomes a bunch of other people. I'm just wearing a green suit walking on the street.

181
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 They're like, "Hey, Andy." This, though, he's come up with, he's thinking ahead of the box. He's not the dude that just named Andy Serkis.

182
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 He's not that guy. He comes up with this plan. He calls it the terrible lifecast ultimate crime.

183
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 He's almost talking about committing crimes, dude.

184
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 Step one, scout out a wealthy victim with similar genes to you.

185
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 So he says that you should have the same height, which at least he has that detail better in the real round news.

186
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 You want to find someone who's around the same height and it would be helpful if you guys had a similar voice.

187
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 It's like I said, this is lucid. Like he is putting some thought into this.

188
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 And it should be someone that already matches a suit you have.

189
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 So apparently you're supposed to go out and be like, "I'd like a rich, snooty suit, please."

190
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 And then you wear this lifecast suit and then you just walk around until you see someone who looks like that suit.

191
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
 That doesn't sound effective. That doesn't sound effective at all.

192
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 Again, sometimes lucid. Then you spy on the family.

193
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 This is so cr- This is so- That first step makes sense. Find a rich guy, look like him.

194
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 Now, the second step. Literally the second step is where it gets super creepy.

195
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 But remember this isn't a crime because we don't exist. He could do this.

196
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 Two, spy on the family. Learn habits. Memorize passwords. That makes sense.

197
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 The little do-do-do-do-do-do-do keypad thing. You're sitting in the bushes. You're sitting in the bushes.

198
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 You're looking like a rich dude. You're watching the rich dude walk around the house and you're memorizing everything.

199
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 Step three. This is what you're ready to do. Step three. Break into house.

200
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 Very, very simple part of the plan. Make sense. If you're going to replace this person, you have to physically be there as well.

201
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 You can't replace the person you're in another country. It wouldn't make sense.

202
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:18,600
 Step three. Break into the house. Step four. Step four. We're not even halfway through the steps.

203
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:26,600
 Kill the father. You kill the guy. Now you go, Jason, of course. Of course you got to murder the guy. You're taking him over.

204
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 Well, that's step four. But later on on step... Wait a minute. It's not even a step.

205
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 After you read this, if you've read this and you're going through a checklist, you got your life cast made out of chewing gum and matchsticks.

206
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,600
 You're walking around looking like this rich guy. You're just going through the list. After the list, after the list, he adds a separate thing.

207
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,600
 Or keep him alive right after you've already murdered him. After you've gone through the list, you're like, "Check, Mark.

208
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 Kill the dad." And then you finish reading the list or keep him alive. And he explains why you should keep him alive. It doesn't make sense.

209
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 But what if you need to leave his DNA behind? So you keep that... You kidnapped the dad that you're disguised as. You time-node chair.

210
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 And then let's say that someone's suspicious of you. You could say, "Go back to your kidnapping novel. Get a little DNA swab from that guy.

211
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:31,600
 Rub it in your mouth and then go, "You don't think I'm your father? Test my saliva." So that makes sense, right?

212
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 Whenever someone's suspicious, they're like, "Hmm. You're acting a little off today." And we're like, "Would you like to test my bodily fluids?"

213
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 That's a totally normal, that's a totally non-alien thing to say. He also says that you may need like his saliva for DNA. Also, keep him alive because you may need his poop.

214
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 Doesn't explain... Doesn't explain why you would need a kidnapped victim who looks like you, why you would need their poop.

215
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 I can't even figure that out. The only thing possible is that if people are getting suspicious because you have like different bowel movements,

216
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 so you'd have to go and like get their poop and throw it in the toilet bowl and then come out and be like, "Honey, tell the kids. Look at that."

217
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 And she's like, "That is your dad's poop." Looks like he's like little rope fibers in it. Like he's been trying to chew at his own restraints.

218
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 Oh, no. That was a new diet I was on. The real me is not kidnapped, barely clinging to life.

219
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 But so yes, you can keep him alive. That is an option that he gives you after the list. Just don't keep him alive because you're not a murderer.

220
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 Keep him alive because you may need his poop.

221
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 Kill the father was step four. Step five. Drain the bank account. You don't need to kill the dude to do that.

222
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,600
 You don't even need to break into the house to do that. You have his passwords. You've memorized all of his mannerisms. Just go to the bank.

223
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 Right? Just go to the bank. And if he had ended the list on step five, you'd be like, "Oh, Max, sure. Sim crime is not a crime." Whatever.

224
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 But then he does step six. And this is where, because there may be people going, "Jason, the guy's a homeless dude. He's a veteran. I left that detail out because I didn't want you to think."

225
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:31,600
 I was going too hard on this guy yet. He's a veteran. I respect the soldiers. He's a veteran. He's a homeless guy. He's picking up cans everywhere.

226
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 He believes that he's trapped in the matrix. You're kind of just making fun of an insane dude. And a veteran. Now that you named that, you jerk.

227
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 Hold on. Hold on because I totally get that impulse. I totally get that impulse. But you didn't let me get to step six.

228
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 Okay, because it's totally after step six, you're going to be like, "Oh, Max. Ugh."

229
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,600
 Step one, get a suit looking like a rich guy. Step two, spy on the family. Three, break into the house.

230
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 Step four, kill the father. Maybe you might need his poop.

231
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 Step five, drain the bank account. Step six, molest the kids.

232
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 You think that's bad? I didn't finish. I did not finish. That's exactly what he wrote. "Molest the kids." And then he wrote, "Daddy no. Daddy no."

233
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:42,600
 Exclamation point. Because the exclamation point makes it worse. And there was no way I was going to read that as a child's voice.

234
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 Step seven, that's not even the end of it. Why would you do that? Why would you, why would you even cross your mind, Max, to do that?

235
00:29:51,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 First off, to think it. But second, don't write it down. I don't get it. Like, this is where people are, I mean, when I was reading this, I'm like, "Haha, kill it. Kill the dude. Why is he doing that?"

236
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,600
 Then I got to step six. I got to step six and I go, "What?" It's awful.

237
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 Step seven, stop seven. Don't even need to do step six. There's no point.

238
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 Step seven, this is a total de-escalation. Sell the house.

239
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 Which I wrote in my notes, how? You're in jail. You're in prison for doing that to your children. Why would you do that?

240
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 But step seven, sell the house. That takes so long to just drain the bank account and leave by another shoot another rich person. Sell the house. Then fake the dude's death.

241
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 What?

242
00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:04,600
 Just, like, I guess I give- you're not him. You just take the suit off, throw it in the bushes and walk away or burn the suit. It's very hard to fake a death.

243
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 You actually have already killed the guy, right? You've already killed the real guy, most likely. Either through killing him or just like taking so much of his poop, he just kind of shrivels up.

244
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 You don't have to go on like, "One flight to the Bahamas, please, on your lowest fueled jet." Like, just don't, just disappear. That was step eight.

245
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 And then, step nine, because this is the world of Max Kramer, he has to put this in here. He has to put the- let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. What's your step nine?

246
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:44,600
 It's not something that I would need to write down. Step nine, take off the disguise.

247
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 No, Dom, Max. Like, you're sitting at home. You've successfully done everything. You're an abhorrent monster. And then you're like, "Oh, hold on. Hold on. One day's work."

248
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:09,600
 And you're sitting at home. You're dressed up as this dude. And then the cops bust in and they arrest you for all of these crimes and you're like, "Oh, dang it. Why didn't I think of a last one? Why didn't I take the suit off?"

249
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 It wasn't on my checklist. I didn't think to do step nine.

250
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:31,600
 He does also let us know the history of the spy disguise evolution. He gives us a very handy list of disguises throughout human history, from caveman days to today.

251
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 Blood, did you know that? The very first costume was blood. It was just bloody guy and they're like, "Hey, who are you?" And he's like, "Bleh." And they didn't know. He got a surprise attack.

252
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:48,600
 After that, they realized that that's a really effective suit. But the problem is you have to be horribly wounded to have it.

253
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,600
 You either have to kill someone and cover yourself in their blood, which at that point you're just standing there and you're like, "Why am I disguised? I already murdered that guy."

254
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,600
 Or you cut yourself and you got all super bloody. So then, someone goes, "Wait a second. Theo over there."

255
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 That was in a traditional caveman name. Theo over there is covered all in blood. He's just lying dead on a rock.

256
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:19,600
 It's not the best disguise. Mud was the second disguise people started using. After that, little known fact, so you had blood, mud, dead human skin.

257
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:29,600
 Remember that? Remember that? You paleontologists that listen to this podcast. You look at the old, they didn't call the crustacean era for nothing.

258
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 You're like, "Jason, there's one. There is no crustacean era. Secondly, if there was, humans weren't around then. I think you mean the cretaceous area.

259
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 But I don't even think you're pronouncing that right. There still weren't humans around. You just wanted to make a joke about crusty skin.

260
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 You're right. The dead human skin. And then after that, this is where we get to some real stuff. Paint. That makes sense.

261
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 I could see mud being a disguise early on. Paint being a disguise. Wood mask. That's true.

262
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 Again, he gets lucid. Blood, mud, human skin, dead. Paint, wood mask, tattoo ink.

263
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 Then there's a pretty big jump. Because tattoo ink still would have been like, what, 1600s when it got mainstream?

264
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 Tattoo ink? That's really not a good disguise either. Oh no, look, it's a dragon coming. The guy just has a dragon tattoo on his forearm.

265
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 The next evolution of the disguise in human history. We went from dead human skin, paint, wood mask, tattoo ink.

266
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:41,600
 Ski mask! Max, the reason why they're called ski masks is they were made for skiing. That wasn't made as a disguise.

267
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 But anyways, the ski mask, and there has to be hundreds of years worth of masks. If you're a maskologist, let me know how many masks.

268
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 But then we go from the ski mask to the rubber life cast, which is what we're talking about here.

269
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 Which we talked about Joe Biden having one as well. And now we are in the era of the edible smart cast.

270
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 So he believes that not only can you look exactly like a rich, famous person, but when you're done with doing that, you can then eat the costume.

271
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 Which is actually a great way to dispose of evidence. Because you eat the costume and there you go.

272
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 You know how hard it would be to eat a six foot...

273
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:39,600
 Dude, you'd get so full. And how edible is it if it's made out of melted bubble gum and toothpicks? You're like, "Oh man, I should have just bought one of the real ones."

274
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 You're gonna eat... Can you eat six foot of anything? And you go, "Jason, you can have like a six foot sub from..."

275
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 You can have a six foot sub from somewhere or something like that. You can, but it's also not three feet wide.

276
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
 Like a human suit would be massive.

277
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:05,600
 The cops are coming and you're like, "Oh man, I'm only down to the waist. I got so much of this suit to eat."

278
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 You're trying to kick it in your door. You're all "arararar" eating as fast as you can.

279
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:24,600
 Oh man, listen man, we have barely scraped the surface of this. That's one page that we've talked about. That is one page. Did I tell you guys he's a video game developer?

280
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:33,600
 He's developed 90 video games. Let me back up. He hasn't programmed anything. He has 90 video game stories that he's come up with.

281
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:39,600
 One about a character he's created that's a Batman-esque vigilante called Jack O'Lantern.

282
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:47,600
 One, there's like three or four games where the point of the game is you're recycling cans.

283
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:55,600
 You're recycling cans. There's a game called the Flutter Birds where you're a flutter man.

284
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:03,600
 You're working for General Flutter Bird and you have to stop snipers who have killed everyone in the neighborhood and put all the bodies in a dumpster.

285
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:14,600
 That's the first level, by the way. To be honest, the games sound fantastic. The games sound so amazing.

286
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,600
 We're going to cover all this stuff. I've got to spread it out. I could honestly just spend the next month talking about this guy.

287
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
 We've got to spread it out. I think we'll do one or two more this week.

288
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,600
 I feel like an archaeologist who has... I didn't find it. Oogs sent it to me.

289
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,600
 But thank you so much. I'm so happy I found this website. This is something that I love, this type of stuff.

290
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps. I can't fanboy about this all day long.

291
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here and wrap it up like this.

292
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 Conspiracy cap fully on. I've seen it three times.

293
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,600
 What if Max is right? I'm not talking about the Matrix stuff.

294
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 I'm not talking about the work computer graphic people.

295
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,600
 What if him and real raw news are right? And I'm the fool.

296
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,600
 There are life-like suits people can wear out there.

297
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,600
 Look just like Joe Biden or Eddie Murphy or Andy Serkis or whoever.

298
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
 That would be terrifying, right?

299
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:18,600
 Because we want to know they existed. You would just go about and you'd see Eddie Murphy walking on the street and you're like, "Hey Eddie, he's all...

300
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:27,600
 You're like, "Jason, that is the worst. That might be the worst."

301
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:36,600
 If I saw Eddie Murphy make that noise, I would assume he was choking.

302
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
 Anyways, I was...

303
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,600
 Now I'm imagining myself walking around in a skinny...

304
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,600
 How damn it. I was trying to make it scary.

305
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,600
 Where somebody comes into your house and he looks like your dad or whatever.

306
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
 He looks like your loved one in his really max creamer.

307
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 But now I just imagine 280 pound Jason walking around in an Eddie Murphy suit.

308
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 The red leather suit is...

309
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,600
 It's like skin tight on me. You're like, "Jason, you are clearly not Eddie Murphy."

310
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,600
 He's not like Fat Albert. That's not like Fat Albert noise.

311
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,600
 Damn it. Okay, so that was supposed to be a scary ending.

312
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,600
 But while you're going to sleep tonight...

313
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,600
 While you're going to sleep tonight, you're sleeping soundly knowing that Jason Carpenter is behind bars.

314
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,600
 He didn't get away with pretending to be Eddie Murphy.

315
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,600
 But while you're sleeping at night tonight, your bedroom door opens.

316
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 And there stands your loved one looking at you.

317
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 But is it your loved one or is it Max Kramer wearing their skin?

318
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 There you go. That's kind of spooky.

319
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,600
 [laughs]

00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,600
