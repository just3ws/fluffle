00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 When a group of construction workers attempt to knock down a haunted school, they have a choice to make.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Leave the job site, or become one of the ghosts themselves.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we travel to Paris to take a look at a bizarre string of disappearances.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Is it possible that a maniac is living in the catacombs underneath the city, or...

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 is the answer far more monstrous today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I am not having a great day, but I hope you're having a great day. I'm actually sick. I'm a little bit under the weather.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 But, I'll get to it. It's probably cold, but it's probably a little more than under the weather.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 But before we get into that, let's introduce today's feature on support.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 He's like, "No, no, I don't want to come in. You're totally contagious."

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Come on in. Everyone give a round of applause for John Shelton. John walking in in full quarantine gear.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 John, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Now I'm going to run over and give John a big old hug. Oh, I'm so glad you're supporting the show.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 He's like, "Stop it, stop it. I'm sick. I don't know if it's COVID because I can't get a test to..."

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 "They're like $100 or the government will send me a free one in like seven days."

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 That's ridiculous. It's going to take forever. So I assume that I have it.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I have a couple of the symptoms. I have the runny nose. I have general just sort like my body hurts.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It feels like the flu, but it's like in my joints that hurts.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Brain fog. I've been having that. I can't say that my taste buds are completely gone, but food tastes bland.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 However, I've been eating really bland food. I've been eating chicken noodle soup and freezer bread.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Bread that I threw in the freezer about a month ago so it didn't go bad.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So I don't know how that's supposed to taste anyways.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And then there's this other weird symptom I have. Every, I don't know, hour or so I get this searing pain in my head.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Like right in my forehead. I just feel like this burning pain.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It's almost like I like almost collapsed to my knees.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And then I'm on Jupiter and there's this huge black cube in the sky.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And a figure steps out of it.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's wrists are slit open and these veins go for miles right into my mouth and I'm just sucking on them.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And I can feel pure COVID entering into my bloodstream.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And I look up at this entity, this new God.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And I continue to just suck on these veins and I just feel so powerful.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And then Dr. Fauci shows up and he starts shaking when he goes, "Resisted son! Resisted! Wake up! We need you!"

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then I'm just sitting back in my living room.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 So I don't know what's up with that. I don't know. I checked the CDC.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 That wasn't listed as one of their symptoms.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's funny. As I've been dealing with my brain melting due to COVID, obviously, a couple of times that has not happened.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 But a couple of times I've found myself just walking in circles in my living room trying to remember what I'm trying to do.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I was thinking that would be a great conspiracy theory, right?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That the COVID is some sort of alien... We talked about it's COVID from space, but what if COVID was an alien invasion type scenario?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 That'd be a really cool conspiracy theory.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I'd say like, COVID is the next stage of human life and the vaccine's supposed to stop.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But you could go either way. Depending on how you felt about COVID or vaccines and stuff like that.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You could make up whatever story you wanted to.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But I thought, where's the... Where's the pizazz? Where is the razzmatazz in our conspiracy theories?

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 COVID as this alien organism invading Earth.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 That's a good conspiracy theory. It's not true.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It's my shift from side to side and they glow. Little COVID, little cartoon COVID things in my peoples.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 But yeah, that would be cool if conspiracy theories wore more... Like, more action packed.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 But they're not. I'm just sick.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And this is what happens when you have COVID apparently. You're like, oh, I wish reality was different.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I do feel... My memory is fading, but I haven't forgotten our Patreon supporter.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 He snuck out. He snuck out during that spooky diet drive.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 John, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 We're driving all the way out to Austin, Texas.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 [imitates car engine]

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 The year is 1990 and we're pulling up in the Soul of Jason Jalopy. Eeeet!

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And we're outside the Metz Elementary School. Now this school has stood in place for 75 years.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Now, the Metz Elementary School for the past 75 years has been a place of joy and wonderment

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 for these little kiddos to run in with their backpacks and learn about the world and to learn about, like, reading and stuff like that.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But it's time to tear it down.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 There's like no more education. We're no longer gonna teach kids in Austin, Texas. You have to go to another state to learn.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They're gonna destroy Metz Elementary School. So the school is shut down and the Torres Construction Company is brought in.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But right when they start doing this demolition work, strange things begin to happen.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 You'd have people climbing up ladders and they're up there, they're like pulling down rain gutters.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 [imitates car engine]

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Throwing stuff. This really unsafe construction company. They're like, "Catch!" They're throwing nails at people below them.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Ah! When these workers are up on these ladders, they would feel someone shaking them at the bottom.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Whoa! And they'd look down and there'd be nobody there.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Sometimes... those were the lucky ones. Sometimes who would be up on ladders, you know, pulling out light bulbs and electrical fixtures and stuff like that.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Then some unknown force would actually sweep the ladder away from underneath them. They'd fall to the ground.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Ah! They're holding light bulbs in each hand. Ah!

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 So you had workers start to be really, really superstitious about what's going on. Why are these ladders keep falling down now?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Maybe they're buying cheap ladders? Who knows? But people start to go, "Ah, maybe I don't want to be on ladder duty today."

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 But that wasn't the only problem. Bulldozers...

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 [imitates bulldozer noise]

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 ...as they're coming towards the school, smoke belching into the air, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, guy working the gears, as it would get closer and closer to the school.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 [imitates bulldozer noise]

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The bulldozer would break down.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Bulldozers were falling apart, not like comically, but they just stopped working as they approached the school.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Now, you're trying to run a job site, and you have a bunch of people who are spooked out. This is not a good mixture.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Elementary schools, they can be a place of magic, 'cause these little kids, they don't know anything about the world. They're learning new stuff every day.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 But at the same time, they're super spooky. Libraries are spooky. Schools are spooky. These liminal spaces are always spooky when they're empty.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 You have these construction workers going in and down these hallways and these empty classrooms and things like that, and they're getting creeped out, and you start to think, "Listen, the bulldozers are breaking down. The ladders are falling apart, but guys, there's no ghosts here.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 That's what you're thinking is not happening. They're like, "Ghost, I didn't think about that!"

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Well, anyways, ghosts aren't happening here.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 These are just coincidences. These are just various malfunctions.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But then the sightings begin. As these workers were to walk into empty classrooms, they would see weird writings scrawled across the chalkboards.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 "Oh, that's just Binny. The guy we just hired. I suspiciously fired before any one of you met him, fellow workers. I hired this guy named Binny," and he wrote those weird scribbles.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I think he was Egyptian or something. "Forget the weird scribbles," the foreman said, and they're like, "Oh, okay, maybe."

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And then there was a worker who was working in one of the restrooms.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 [Laughs]

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 The worker turns around and he sees a little kid looking out through one of the bathroom stalls.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 [Laughs]

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So now, they're like, "Foreman, did you hire a little child as well from Egypt?

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I saw a little kid in the bathroom and there have not been any kids here. It's been weeks since we've been working on this school, and I saw a little kid hiding in the bathroom. What is up with that?"

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So at that point, the foreman had no excuse, because otherwise his excuse would be violating child labor laws.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 So half the crew quit.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Half the crew was like, "You know what? I'll go get a job tearing down some other building. I quit."

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 The rest two stayed to work, made a compromise. We'll stay to work, but we will not work inside the building.

103
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And the foreman's like, "You have to be inside to destroy the building, right? It's not a comic book. You just can't drive a bulldozer in the entire building. It just becomes a pancake."

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You have to go in there. They refused.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So the tourist construction company called in an exorcist to perform an exorcism on the school.

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And finally, the foreman, who's actually Joe Torres himself, the foreman goes, "Okay, are you happy now? We have this guy come through and he exercised the place. And will you go inside to work now?"

107
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And the workers are like, "Yeah, I guess." So they start going back into the school, shortly after that one of the co-owners of Torres Construction Company was working in the school himself, and a wall collapsed on him, killed him on the spot.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Even with that death on the scene, the workers continued to do it, and the school was finally torn down completely, six months behind schedule.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It took them that much longer to get rid of the 75-year-old elementary school.

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Probably I'm surprising it took longer if they only had half their workforce.

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Now, a falling wall to you and me is supernatural in and of itself, right? Like, if you were at your work, you're a mailman, you're driving your car, and a wall fell on you. That would be the most bizarre way to go.

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I think for most people's profession. But as a construction worker, as a demolition expert, it's a hazard of the job.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 For most people, although they were suspicious and they didn't see all these ghosts and things like that, the exorcism had happened, and people go, "Well, maybe the wall just fell accidentally."

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I mean, they did knock out the other three walls, and this one was all dusty and barely leaning. He shouldn't have been there, but maybe it was just an unfortunate accident. It's part of the industry.

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 After the elementary school was completely torn down, Joe Torres, now probably the sole owner of Torres Construction, takes a tree from the school site.

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He goes, "I really like this tree. It's all soaked in the blood of all of his coworkers." He's like, "Oh, it's so pretty in spring."

117
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He takes this tree and he plants it in the front yard of his daughter's home. It's just such a pretty tree, apparently, and a reminder who's really in charge, who really owns Torres Construction.

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 To this day, people say when you drive past his daughter's house, you'll see this tree in her front yard.

119
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And sometimes, you'll hear the sound of children playing. "Peek-a-boo! Hee-hee-hee-hee! Can you trade me those Pokemon cards? Here's a Charizard for two Mew-toos!"

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Um, yeah, if you go by her house, you'll hear little kids outside. It's not her kids who are kids who are playing next to the tree they're going to possess.

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 The tree, like, you can hear the sounds of laughter and little kids playing jump rope and stuff like that.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Very, very interesting ghost story. I got it from my favorite book, the book "Hunted Places," the National Directory.

123
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You can buy it on Amazon. I've got a link in the show notes. It's not an affiliate link. Just buy it. It's a great book.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And then I did some additional research online. Great ghost story. The question that I have about this stuff, because this one has...

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 This is a really good ghost story and it's very recent. And it has a lot of specific names. So I started thinking, "Is it real?"

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I always think that, obviously, but this was one that we might be able to dig into. Is this an urban legend? Is it an actual ghost story?

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Well, I was able to find a news article in a newspaper called "The Austin American Statesman." It was published on August 27, 1992 by John Bryant.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And, let me read you this quote. This is really fascinating, again, because even though it's recent and this story takes place in the 1990s,

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 memories fade and not everyone keeps a complete archive. I'm actually really lucky I was able to find that.

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So the story I just told you is repeated in "Ghost Lore." The National Directory haunted places you'll find other ghost sites that tell you the story.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 This is from an actual newspaper. This is from a legitimate news source. Quote,

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 "In spite of nationally publicized rumors..." So this was a big story at the time.

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "In spite of nationally publicized rumors that the Met's site is haunted by ghosts of children who had died in the school, the new campus opened smoothly Tuesday with no need for ghostbusters."

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Really, really interesting. So these reports were real.

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 At the time, this was an event that was actually going on. Now, it doesn't say anyone died at the site.

136
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 But there's one thing that I was curious about as well. On the one hand, if someone died on the site of a haunted school, you think that would be written.

137
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And they're like, "And kids, as you're going into this new school, remember a man died where the cafeteria now is?"

138
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Like, on the one hand, you think they would go after the tragic death to one of the owners. The school was still open.

139
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 But, so that's part of the story may be made up. We don't know.

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But this was national news when it was going on. In spite of nationally publicized rumors. So that's really, really interesting, isn't it?

141
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's what I love. That's one of the things I really love about this job is just taking the ghost stories and then digging into it.

142
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So yeah, parts of this story were true. The one question I have is whether or not the owner, the co-owner, died.

143
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 But there were workers walking off the job site because they thought this place was haunted.

144
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 So the stories were there. This is not just an urban legend. It was being reported on as it was happening.

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Why? See, for me, I don't mind collecting haunted items. I don't mind collecting haunted items.

146
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 So if I found the tree at a haunted house, I would take it.

147
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 They're like, "Jason, that's my dream. Running away, running away."

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Then I'm like, "Your house is full of ghosts. I want this tree."

149
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But I don't think I would give it to my daughter. I want to be like, "Here you go, honey."

150
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 To show that I love you so much, I'm going to give you this thing that is going to take root in your front yard and be possessed with the souls of the damned.

151
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I wouldn't do that to somebody else. I find that interesting.

152
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 One end of Joe Torres probably was one of the guys who just didn't believe there were ghosts.

153
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Got the exorcist because he had to.

154
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And he's like, "Whatever. I don't believe in ghosts."

155
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And then even though he's ignorant of that, there were ghosts there, he's giving his daughter a haunted tree.

156
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 So if you're in Austin, Texas, just drive around the area, driving around the area with your windows rolled down really late at night.

157
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And slow down whenever you see a tree in someone's front yard. And listen really carefully.

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Either you'll hear the whispers of dead children tickle your eardrums,

159
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 or you will hear the sirens of police as they're wondering why someone's driving around at 3 in the morning super slow in front of people's houses.

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Either way, it'll be an interesting night. A night you'll never forget.

161
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 John, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 We are leaving behind Austin, Texas before any of these ghost kids can hitch a ride.

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 We're headed all the way out to Paris.

164
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 [imitates car engine]

165
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Now I gotta be honest with you guys. I actually told this story before.

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I told it as a footnote, I told it as a 5 minute story at the end of like episode 49.

167
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And I love this story. I actually thought that I had covered it again later in the run of the show, and I realized that I hadn't.

168
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So I wanted to go ahead and let the story breathe a bit, and if you haven't listened to episode 49, this will all be new to you.

169
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I remember reading this story in the 40 in times, and I was absolutely transfixed.

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 We're in Paris, France. Specifically, we're in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.

171
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 In the neighborhood of Esor.

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And what happens? It's 1894, and this is just a little town. It's like a neighborhood in Paris.

173
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And people are just walking around, drinking coffee, eating baguettes, doing French stuff.

174
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But every so often, somebody goes missing.

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It doesn't happen all the time, but the police are supposed to investigate it, right?

176
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And they're not just like, "Oh, we wait for three people to go missing before we start to work."

177
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 What happens is, about once a year, for the past four years, someone has gone missing in Esor.

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 There's no correlation between their sex or their age, but it always happens between March 20th and March 31st.

179
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And it's never a child.

180
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Those are the only things that they know.

181
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 It's happened four times. It doesn't matter boy or girl.

182
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But it's actually not a boy or girl, it's a man or a woman. And it happens in that time period.

183
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Now remember, this is, like Jack the Ripper was operating in 1888.

184
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So just, man, just six years earlier was kind of the birth of the modern serial killer.

185
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So it would have been super, like nowadays, if this happened, you would immediately start to suspect a serial killer

186
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 just because of the weird date range.

187
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 You're like, "Is this the time that the guy has free time?"

188
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 He's like, "Oh, honey, I'm gonna go down to Esor and start murdering people just for a week, then I gotta get back to work."

189
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But serial killers weren't really a phenomenon back then, but the police still have to figure this out

190
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 because people go missing in this area.

191
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And since March was coming up, it's 1894 and it's coming up to March 20th,

192
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 the French police are just swamping this area.

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And at 3 a.m. there's an officer, we're gonna call him Officer Tyler.

194
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So Tyler, this French police officer, is walking down the street, it's 3 a.m.

195
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He's twirling around his billy club and he's just his feet are on the cobblestones, clip, clip, clop.

196
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Clip, clop, clip, clop.

197
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And off in the distance, he hears...

198
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 [singing]

199
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 He doesn't actually have the sheet music for what the melody was, but he hears a strange melody coming from somewhere in Esor.

200
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 [singing]

201
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He's walking through the streets.

202
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 It's 3 a.m. All the Apple stands are shut for the night, people are sleeping,

203
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 smoke stacks in the distance,

204
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 [singing]

205
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 belching up black smoke, chimney sweeps dancing around.

206
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 All the stuff that you would assume back in 1894.

207
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 [singing]

208
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Following the sound, he comes to the Tomb of Esor.

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So the neighborhood of Esor is named after this tomb of a guy named Esor.

210
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 What this is? I know this is super complicated, you're like getting at your notes, you're like, "I got it, Jason."

211
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 First off, I don't think you pronounce it any of this, right? I'm surprised you got Paris, right?

212
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Anyways, so here's what happens... I almost do a separate story on this, so I'm gonna have to try to get this packed in here.

213
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 This is fascinating in and of itself.

214
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 In this location, there is a place called the Tomb of Esor, a.k.a. the Giant's Cave.

215
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And this tomb is directly connected to the Paris Catacombs, so underneath the city of Paris, there's this massive series of tunnels that have a bunch of bodies in them.

216
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 They've been using it to store bodies for hundreds of years, really. You can go down there, you can get lost down there, there's tours, it's super spooky.

217
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 There's been a ton of movies, horror movies based on that place, and just historical accounts underneath the city of Paris.

218
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 You have all of these bones. I don't even think the Catacombs have been fully explored, honestly.

219
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 So you have the Tomb of Esor, a.k.a. the Giant's Cave, and the story is... there's a giant buried there.

220
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The story goes that before the Christian era, there was a race of giants in the area, and one of these giants was named Isor, and he actually was a brigand.

221
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 He would rob people as they were moving through this area of France.

222
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 This wasn't like a place with bakeries and delis at the time. It was just like a road.

223
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And this... because this was before Jesus was born, right? This was before France was even a thing.

224
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 There was this giant who would waylay travelers and smash their heads open and take all their stuff.

225
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And eventually the people in the area were like, "We gotta do something about this. He's gonna kill us all."

226
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 So they actually assaulted him, and they killed him, and he was so huge, he was so giant, they couldn't move his body.

227
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Now, I would have probably just like chopped him up and walked him... I put his legs on, he's like, "Stilts, I'm looking at me. I'm a giant now."

228
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But they didn't do that. They're not super disgusting and macabre.

229
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They buried him where he laid, and that is the giant's tomb.

230
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And what's really interesting is France is...

231
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 So the Basque people were there before there were French people there, and the Basque people have legends that, before the birth of Christ, the whole area was run by giants.

232
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And when the Star of Bethlehem shown in the sky, saying that it was time for the Messiah to be born, the giants said, "Time to leave.

233
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 New dude in town. We're not allowed here anymore." And they left. That's an old Basque legend.

234
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We talked about that on another episode. I'm Basque, so I did a whole episode about Basque Christmas traditions.

235
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 But yeah, that's a really cool parallel, because it does match the same thing now.

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 In the Basque legend, the giants just left. This dude got attacked by a bunch of people stabbing him, but it is an area that is known for giants.

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And nowadays, you can go to this area in France, the Isor neighborhood, and they have a statue of Isor on the side of a building.

238
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's three stories tall. It's about 30 feet tall, and the statue's him sitting down.

239
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So this dude was massive. It would have taken an entire village, or maybe a couple of them if he was way-lain travelers, to take this dude down.

240
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 But the giants cave, and there actually is provenance of giants active in this area pre-Christian era.

241
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Just a really interesting side note. Almost deserving of its own story, but...

242
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 What was this officer doing? I can't tell. He went off on a whole giant thing. What was the cop's name?

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Tyler is walking through the street, and he hears this...

244
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 [humming]

245
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 He hears this melody, and he sees the tomb of Isor. Now, there was this giant boulder that was placed on his tomb to mark this is where he was buried.

246
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And it's also this boulder leads down into the catacombs.

247
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 When the officer who's familiar with this area, when he gets there, he realizes the boulder is slightly moved away.

248
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 [humming]

249
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And the song is coming from within the darkness of this tomb.

250
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Clip-a-dee-clop, clup, clip-a-dee-clop, clup. That's when he hears the sound of somebody else walking down these streets.

251
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And he turns and sees this man walking in tune to the music.

252
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 [humming]

253
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 He's a little dance move. Now he's breakdancing. He's moving in tune to this music, and the cop is watching this.

254
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 He watches this man, and he's walking towards the opening in the tomb.

255
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And as the man is getting closer, the music gets a little faster, and the man picks up his pace.

256
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Before Tyler can even react to what's going on, the man is now broken out into a full sprint.

257
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 The song's become dubstep, and he broke out into a full sprint, and he ran into the darkness of the cave.

258
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Tyler grabs his revolver, click, gets his whistle.

259
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Just as long before radios were invented, they didn't even know about two tin cans in a string, he gets his whistle.

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 [mimics whistle]

261
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 That whistle carried for miles, and all the other cops who were on their own little streets trying to prevent another missing person hear that whistle.

262
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And police from all over begin to head towards the tomb of Isor.

263
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Tyler, though, is unsure if they'll get there in time.

264
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So with his revolver ready, he also runs into the darkness of the tomb.

265
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 By the time the other officers show up, the singing is done. There's no more melody coming from the tomb.

266
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 But, I mean, they're police officers. They can figure it out.

267
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 They got an alert of a whistle of a fellow officer in the area. They see the boulder moved aside.

268
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 They see the darkness of this cave. Get some ropes! Get some ladders, guys! Bring the torches! Let's go!

269
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And these guys, the guys are a bit smarter than Tyler. They begin to very carefully go into the tomb.

270
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 They realize quickly that when you walk in, it's not like a cave. It's a pit.

271
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So they realize that getting the ladders and the ropes were necessary.

272
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 They see it's a real steep drop-off. So they start climbing down on the ropes. They have their torches.

273
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And in the darkness, they see a man on his back, squirming.

274
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 One of the officers is holding the torch up, hoping to get a better look.

275
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Is that their fellow officer? Do they recognize the uniform?

276
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And then...

277
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 They see it.

278
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 A massive spider, barely illuminated by the torchlight, is standing over the man on the ground.

279
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 They said it was the size of a terrier. This was a 50-pound spider in the darkness with its legs flicking upwards.

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And on the end of each of these legs, unlike a normal spider, it had claws.

281
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Its abdomen was covered in thick bristly hair, and giant wart-like growths seemed to protrude out of its body at random places.

282
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 This creature is so focused on its task, it doesn't even realize that its layers have been invaded by all these police officers.

283
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 In the darkness, there's only two sounds that could be heard.

284
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 The flickering flames of the torches, and the sound of blood being drained out of a living human.

285
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Shock is replaced with anger. The officers already their revolvers and just light this toot up.

286
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Greenish fluid begins shooting out of its wounded abdomen. The spider turns and raises its arms, trying to snap and bite at these guys,

287
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 but it's no match for lead penetrating its body.

288
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 And the spider dies.

289
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Some of the police officers run towards the man who is dead now. He had enough blood drained from his body that he's not going to make it.

290
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And then in the darkness, they see Tyler, who, in his good-hearted nature, trying to save this guy, ran and fell.

291
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Remember, it was a pit. He didn't know it was a pit. He ran and he fell about 30 feet, and he was unconscious.

292
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 He was not there for the final shootout. Well, he was there, but he was just laying on the ground, and he was able to be rescued.

293
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 He actually made it.

294
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They finally bring him back to the surface, and as Tyler regains consciousness, he looks up at the beautiful Paris night sky.

295
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He realizes that he was just moments away from dying in a pitch black hole, devoured by a monster, a beast, devoured by the singing spider of the Paris catacombs.

296
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I love it. I love this type of stuff.

297
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 I remember reading this long time ago, and the 40 in times, I was transfixed. It was as if the article was singing to myself.

298
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Is it true, though? That's always the question I like to ask. It's not always a question we can have an answer to.

299
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 This one, this was published in the newspaper. This was published in the newspaper back on September 14th, 1894, in the Ann Arbor Argus, which is a real newspaper.

300
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 What's really interesting about old-timey newspapers?

301
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 This is something we see a lot about old giant stories, old newspapers that have photos of giants.

302
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Back then, and even today, honestly, but back then, newspapers made stuff up.

303
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Back in the early 1900s, late 1800s, you had people just completely making stuff up to sell newspapers.

304
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 This article, this story is published in one newspaper that anyone can find, and it's the Ann Arbor Argus, which is an American newspaper in Ann Arbor.

305
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So, is the story true?

306
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 It does give us some interesting clues at the end of the article. Let's take a look at this.

307
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It goes on to explain that this spider is known as the arachne giganus. It's a giant spider that was believed to be extinct.

308
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Spiders used to be able to get this big, apparently, when oxygen levels were different, like prehistoric spiders were bigger than the spiders are today.

309
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So they said that these things used to be able to exist they don't now, and that apparently, after this event, scientists started to believe that these spiders may exist in the Periscatacomes.

310
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 They say that this body was preserved. It was actually pulled out of the catacombs, because obviously you're not just going to leave it down there.

311
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 This is a scientific marvel, and it was exhibited at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, France.

312
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 This article, you know, a lot of people really, really like this article. It's cool.

313
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 A lot of people looked into it. Apparently, there is not in France a place called the Museum of Natural History, nor has there ever been.

314
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 That's what other researchers have said. They go, "Maybe they meant this museum or this museum."

315
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 But when you have a detail that's verifiably false, it really puts a suspect on the rest of the story.

316
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 So, from a scientific perspective, this story didn't happen, right?

317
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 But from a par-- In the world of the paranormal, this could happen.

318
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And just like the story from 1990 that I covered, where they said, "Nationally rumored ghost story."

319
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 This was going all over the news. The only article I could find that talked about the Met's Elementary School and Ghost was one article.

320
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 So, just because it's only in one newspaper doesn't mean it's fake.

321
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Now, there's other stuff that can make it be fake. A 50-pound spider existing today.

322
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 But in the world of the paranormal, we accept these type of things.

323
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I don't throw that out as the end-all be-all. But I do want to cover that as well.

324
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It's only in one newspaper. Newspaper has some factual issues.

325
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I love this story, though, because this is one of the stories that I believe could be real.

326
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Because I love monsters. Like, why wouldn't I want a world filled with mysterious monsters coming out of the catacombs?

327
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 This creature long-thought-dead existing down there, and it's only-- it needs to feed once a year.

328
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And this is where it lives. And a giant spider in a place known for giant activity.

329
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Like, old myths. The Basque mythology is very, very giant heavy.

330
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And that's in this region. Giant men, giant spiders. Right? That's how it works, right?

331
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Manute Bull has giant guinea pigs hanging out with them.

332
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 You have this location known for its gigantism and you have this giant spider.

333
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I love it. I think it's super creepy. I really, really do. I love everything about it.

334
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I love giant spiders. I love people fighting back against monsters.

335
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And it's a-- I love this story, and we'll end it up like this.

336
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Because humans like to think that we're the masters of the planet, because we can reshape it.

337
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 We can harness the power of the sun and the wind. We can split the atom.

338
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 But the surface of the world is the tip of the iceberg, right?

339
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Like, what is inside the world? What is in the oceans? Endless catacombs. Tunnels. Caves.

340
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 What is in there? Beasts? Monsters? Creatures of darkness?

341
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Things that we can never even imagine because they're so removed from our environment.

342
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 We are unknown to each other. But every so often one of these monsters gets loose.

343
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Every so often one of these creatures crawls closer and closer to the surface.

344
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Now, within the planet, resources are fairly scarce. It's brutal. It's dark. Every day is a fight for survival.

345
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I don't even know what the day is. I've never seen the sun. But every moment is a fight for survival.

346
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 But one of these creatures eventually makes it to a closer and closer to the surface.

347
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And realizes, on the surface, everything is food. It's lush and vibrant. And everything's squishy. Everything's frail.

348
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Your body has evolved to combat monsters from the abyss. But on the surface, the creatures have simply evolved to thank and walk up right.

349
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And use thumbs to write letters. Delicious morsels everywhere. Unarmed. Unarmored. And unaware of your existence.

350
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 The creatures that inhabit our planet but live in the darkness underneath us. Are they the true masters of the world?

351
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 The only reason why civilization exists is because they haven't come up in mass. They haven't discovered us as a species yet.

352
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Every so often one of them may. We call it a cryptid. We call it a monster. We call it impossible. And go on with our lives.

353
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But if one day more of these creatures from the pitch blackness beneath our feet rise up, will we be able to stop them?

354
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 It took a legion of French police to take down one spider that was unaware that they were even in there.

355
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 What would happen if thousands, if millions of these creatures crawled out of the crevices in a single night?

356
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Would man remain the top of the food chain? Or would we simply be prey, be food, to the creatures beneath us?

357
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 You may not believe in the existence of giant spiders. But as you find yourself webbed up with your family in your house, staring at your loved ones with pleading eyes,

358
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 "Help me, help me." But nobody can help anyone.

359
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 These spiders have conquered the planet. They're laying eggs inside of your body. You can feel your flesh undulate.

360
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 It takes days for them to eat through your organs. Somehow you're still alive.

361
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Somehow you're still alive.

362
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 New York Times is like more spiders invading. You're like, "Oh man, what's the sports page?"

363
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 It's the spiders eating a bunch of football players. And the spiders are keeping you alive. They're eating your organs.

364
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And you're like, "Uh, they're eating the organs you don't really need at first." They're like, "Oh, pancreas."

365
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And then your appendix, "Nom nom nom." But then eventually, right before you die, you start to see your skin kind of split open and you're watching all these little spiders crawl out of the opening in your rotting flesh.

366
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 "Uuuuugh!" You've now given birth to a whole new generation of these monstrous spiders.

367
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 The only reason why we think we run the world is because we have not encountered our true competitors. Yet.
