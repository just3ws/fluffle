1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,800
 A beautiful bandit, a mysterious family, and a UFO story so bizarre even veteran UFOologists

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:21,200
 have a hard time believing it. What happened in 1955 in a sleepy little town in California?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,720
 Were they invaded by aliens only children could see today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:40,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,320
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's actually only about two hours

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,720
 since I finished the last podcast. Most of you guys know I work three jobs every so often.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,920
 Someone has to take a vacation at one of the jobs and I cover form. It's once in a blue moon,

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,160
 but starting this week into next week and a little bit of the week after that,

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,760
 I'm working all three jobs every single day. So try to get these episodes out when I can get them

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
 out. And that's one of the good things about doing a solo podcast. I just want to get them out once a

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,240
 day for you guys. So if anything absolutely earth-shattering has happened from the time I'm

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,480
 recording this to the time you hear it, it's not because I ignored it, didn't know what happened

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,520
 yet. I'm recording this at 11 o'clock at night. But let's go ahead and jump right into this one.

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
 I'll keep my energy level up for you. I'm drinking my diet mountain dew, choice of a generation.

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,560
 So hop on board. Let's use the Jason Jalopy. So throw your bags in the back. This is going to be a

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,440
 long journey. We're going to have, bring a sleeping bag, some popcorn. I don't know why popcorn.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,240
 Bring food. That was what I'm saying. Bring yourself some food or some delicious beverages from

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,320
 PepsiCo only because they sponsor the show. No Coke. No Mr. Pib. No Dr. Pepper either. That's

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,360
 just disgusting. Prune juice flavored soda. Get in the car. And also they don't sponsor us for

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
 legal reasons. That was a joke. We're driving down the road. Beep, beep. Keep your hand off the horn.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,440
 Only I can press the horn. Drive another road. And we're pulling up to Sugarland, Texas.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,280
 This just happened August 23rd, 2019. So this happened on Friday, last Friday. It's 825.

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 The darkest time of night when all the spooky stuff happens. 825 is quite early for this type of

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,120
 activity. We're parked across the street in our Jason Jalopy eating. You brought snacks. I'm eating

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
 them too. You're like Jason. I'm like, I thought you were on keto. I'm like, I'm trying to break.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,160
 Doritos. So as I'm swelling up and some gaining 10 pounds of water weight from just eating one

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,960
 Dorito, we're looking across the street and there's a place. There's like a parking lot.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,760
 And we see this hot woman hops out of the car. And you're like Jason, you have to objectify her.

29
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,520
 Yes, I do because that's the point of the story. Now give me some more Doritos.

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:04,160
 You see this hot woman hop out of the car. Blonde hair, pink blouse, yoga pants. You're

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,720
 taking a look. Hold on. This is important for the story. This is important for the story.

32
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,280
 And also it's not just my fantasy. This is on surveillance video. Hot blonde hops out of the

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,200
 car. Hair blowing in the wind. Beat of sweat moving down her chest. No, so anyways, we see on

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,440
 surveillance video this blonde woman gets out of her Mercedes SUV, walks over to a building,

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,080
 tries opening the door, goes back to her SUV, gets a portable power saw and begins cutting through

36
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,320
 the window because she's breaking into the Botox RN MD Spa. It's a place where they injected

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,080
 Botox into people's faces. Makes your face all tight, gets rid of the wrinkles. She cut her way

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,960
 in and stole a bunch of Botox and then gets in her Mercedes SUV, just drives away. They don't know

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,760
 who it is. They have no suspects. She's not wearing a mask. She's just walking up in her pink blouse.

40
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
 She looks like she just got done picking up the kids or, hey, I'm not going to be sexist. Maybe

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,280
 she just got done buying a business. Maybe she's a CEO. I don't know. Maybe she's president of

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,960
 the United States, Jason. Don't be sexist. So nobody knows who this woman is, but anyways,

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,480
 she gets in her car and she drives away. Now I will say this though, police of Sugarland, Texas.

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,600
 My personal, if I was a cop, I would just look for women who look permanently surprised. Their

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
 eyebrows are all lifted. No wrinkles. They'd be like, where were you Friday night? She's like,

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
 no emotion on her face. Actually, she'd be really good in interrogation room because you wouldn't

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,840
 be able to read her face. It would be full of a deadly disease and she shows no emotions. Just

48
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,640
 constantly looks like she's in shock. I'm arrested versus hello. I guess your voice doesn't change.

49
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,680
 Anyways, so be on the lookout, residents of Sugarland, Texas. An attractive woman

50
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,440
 may actually have a face like her entire body at this point. It's just 90% Botox and she's coming

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 for you. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Hop back in the Jason Jalopy. We are driving

52
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,560
 to a place that was recommended to me by Andrew. Andrew via Gmail sent me this recommendation.

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,880
 We are going to Yucca, Ipa, Yucca, Yucca, Ipa, California. So we're going there. We're going

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,120
 to, we're just call it the Big U. We're going to the Big U out in California. I'm driving up. Now

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,520
 actually, it's perfect. We're in the Jason Jalopy for this story because this story requires you

56
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,760
 to be in a car. So we stopped at that gas station. You bought some beef jerky, right? Okay, awesome.

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,280
 You're like, Jason, you have a Patreon now. You can afford your own food. I was like,

58
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,680
 I'm putting the gas in, man. So anyways, we drive up to outside of this house. There's a specific

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,640
 house in the Big U, Yucca Paya, and it's an urban legend come true, video proof of this house. And

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,360
 what happened was it started off in the area and then it spread to the internet and then things

61
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,960
 got really bad. If you pull up to this particular house in Yucca Paya, you're driving your car,

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,160
 you park in front of it, and a bunch of people come out of the house. Now you're thinking that's

63
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,400
 not unusual. And so it's funny because it's so mundane, but at the same time,

64
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,280
 it's very, very bizarre when you kind of step back and think about it. People will drive up to this

65
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,320
 house and park outside the house. And then a bunch of people come outside the house. That's the story.

66
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,680
 That's the story. That's the story of Yucca Paya. They're technically called the Yucca Paya

67
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,400
 Watchers. So that makes it sound like really sinister, but that's it. You drive in front of a house

68
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,600
 and people come out. And what's okay? So if someone just said, "Hey dude, did you know that if you drive

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,400
 down this spooky street during the day in the middle of the day and park in someone else's parking

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,600
 spot, someone's gonna come out of the house?" You'd be like, "That's the dumbest urban legend I've

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,000
 ever heard." But the reason why Andrew sent this to me, it's because these guys don't just come out

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,720
 of their house. They come out like four or five deep and begin screaming at people in their cars.

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,040
 So there's tons of YouTube videos of people, you know, just dumb kids driving in front of this house

74
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,720
 and they just park. And then like four dudes come barreling out of the house. They're all like

75
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 donkey kong. They're like, "Get out of the house!" So they've made themselves into a target for people

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,160
 to just park the car any time of the day. And that's why they call the watchers. They don't just

77
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,960
 watch, but they know when you're there. People are like, "We think they have cameras." Probably,

78
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,600
 probably. But it's one of those, I mean, again, it's they've made themselves a target for people

79
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,840
 parking in their front yard, which seems so not even in the front yard. They're not driving up on

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
 the grass. They're like, "Oh, my petunias!" It's like they just park the car. The problem is,

81
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,320
 is it's gotten to the point where people in the neighborhood are like, "Hey, look at these local

82
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,200
 weirdos." Like in Bay Area, I've talked about him before. We have that guy named Joe Trombone,

83
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,880
 who's this crazy schizophrenic hobo who just rapped all the time. Local legend. But in Yucapaya,

84
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,040
 you have people going, "Hey, man, those guys, they run out of their house when you're parked."

85
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,360
 And then people started doing it on YouTube and then people started coming from all over California

86
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,640
 to videotape themselves. I'm surprised Jake Paul hasn't done a video with these guys yet.

87
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,240
 It's become this thing. And they call the cops all the time. So now you run the risk of being

88
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
 arrested for parking your car. And this was a total flashback for me. I read this short story.

89
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,040
 I watched a couple videos about the Yucapaya Watchers and then I read this story.

90
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
 I'll try to make it shorter. It's kind of, let's see how long this goes.

91
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,360
 "I don't know how many of you heard of the Yucapaya Watchers. But don't ever go there."

92
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,040
 They were pretty famous on YouTube. Here's the legend. That's their word. Legend has it.

93
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,360
 "If you go by there any time day or night, the people who live there will come out of the house

94
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,160
 and confront you and talk." Beep. Beep that up. People listen to the show at work.

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
 "Me and my friends went there and just like they say, they immediately misspelled.

96
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,600
 Immediately come outside. It was two in the morning. So the beep started walking to the vehicle

97
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,680
 with a full, flesh sasch light." I really shouldn't make fun of people spelling because of my

98
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,280
 pronunciations but a flesh sasch light shone on us and started talking. Beep.

99
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,360
 "He took down our plate and called the cops." I guess. I probably could have read that more

100
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
 smooth. "He took down our plate and called the cops I guess and we got pulled over on our way back

101
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,840
 to the freeway. The officer said she knew we were at the Watchers and knew we filmed it and blah

102
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,200
 blah so they checked us." This is my favorite part. This reminded me of me being in my 20s.

103
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760
 I loved it. It just had this like, this put a smile on my face when I read this last sentence.

104
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,600
 "So they checked us all and looked for any excuse to arrest us since driving by a house isn't really

105
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:10,000
 illegal. Long story short, my friend had one Tylenol 3 on him that he doesn't have a prescription for

106
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,080
 so they arrested him. Don't ever effing go there." Now I'm not happy that the kid got arrested

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,840
 obviously but I remember being such a stupid knucklehead kid and just doing dumb stuff and

108
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,000
 you'd be driving with your buddies and the one kid has a single pill. I don't know why I find that

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,600
 so funny. It's just such a flashback to what people do as kids that are idiots. So yes,

110
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,880
 I don't think the moral of the story is don't go to the Ucopie Watchers. Don't have prescriptions,

111
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 even a single pill on you if you're going to do something semi-legal. But so the legend is this,

112
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,720
 is that the Ucopie Watchers are like satanic cult or they're meth dealers like they have something

113
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,160
 to protect. I just think they're weirdos who have attracted more weirdness to them because

114
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,320
 of the way they react stuff. So thank you Andrew for the recommendation but looking into it I don't

115
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,760
 think there's anything sinister going on. I just think they're lunatics for legal reasons. A legend

116
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,320
 lunatics who have like maybe they're think they're gangstaught or but the thing is is like every

117
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,840
 time they react in a crazy way more and more people want to go out there because they see these

118
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,280
 crazy videos. So it keeps going on. The legend that I think is going to happen is they're going to

119
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,400
 end up shooting somebody or there's going to be a serious fight because the people drive away real

120
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,640
 quick when they get nearby. They're like man that was close everyone take their tight little three oh

121
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,360
 it feels so groovy now. Driving away but yeah I don't know. I think it's an interesting local

122
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
 legend and because of things like YouTube it's become far far more popular. I mean like sometimes

123
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,880
 you can engage in behavior that makes you more likely to become an urban legend like the Ucopie

124
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,760
 people. Okay so we're driving away from Ucopie. They're chasing us down the street. I'm like oh

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,920
 good thing I still have all this pain medication on me. You're like Jason no you're driving. I'm

126
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,200
 like you take the wheelie. I'm just going to lay in the back seat for a while and be constipated

127
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,600
 and you're like where are we going Jason? I just can't drive the Jason Jalopy wherever I want or

128
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,320
 can I and you try to take it back in time but I'm like no no no don't do that. Only I can

129
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,120
 activate the magical powers of the Jason Jalopy. We are going to Casablanca and you're like yes

130
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,680
 played against Sam. No we're going to Casablanca in 1955. You're like yes is that when the movie

131
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
 came out? I'm like no actually I don't know when that movie came out. I'm going to come out in 1955.

132
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,400
 No we're going to Casablanca, California. So we're almost there. We're going to Riverside County

133
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,800
 so go ahead hit that button right there. Take us back to the year 1955.

134
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:51,200
 Car, the car does not sound that smooth. It actually sputters and barely gets us to 1955

135
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,400
 Casablanca, California and I'm going to tell you a story. I'm going to tell you a story.

136
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,240
 It was a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Two p.m. Kids are out playing, flying kites,

137
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,960
 eating apples, having fun. There's a group of eight kids wrestling. Well technically only two of

138
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,200
 them are wrestling but the other six are like fight fight fight and we have a dude named Kermit

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,360
 Douglas. His whole body's all oiled up ready to go and then an unnamed kid who I imagine he's wearing

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,120
 like a unit's heart he's like come get some big chest hair they're wrestling in Kermit's yard

141
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:39,520
 and then they hear a ping kids look up in the sky and they see a dome like a silvery it was like

142
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:48,720
 silvery and translucent dome in the sky and he goes ping disappears and then they hear a ping

143
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,080
 and they see what looks like a flying saucer but it's flying sideways so it's like stationary but

144
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,200
 it looks like a circle in the sky and they're said they could see light bending around the edges of it

145
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
 at this point Kermit's like come on let's go let's go everyone else is looking at these things

146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:12,880
 Kermit's like what he looks up he sees it and he's like oh I better stop wrestling ping disappears

147
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,280
 ping the dome appears ping disappears ping sideways flying saucer appears ping

148
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,960
 disappears and the two vehicles started going ping ping ping appearing and disappearing appearing

149
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,760
 and disappearing in front of these kids now one of the kids is like this is not good I'm out and he

150
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,160
 runs away and he runs home and he tells mom mom there's some pinging out there you got to come out

151
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,200
 and see what's in the sky now of course she's probably like oh great gotten to his dad's acid

152
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,680
 again but she's like looks out the window she's like I don't see nothing and the kid's like oh mom

153
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,320
 he runs back to join his friends to see if this is still going on his mom couldn't see anything though

154
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,200
 he goes back and he goes hey so what happened with those UFO things and the kids go in unison all

155
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,200
 seven of them go we don't just so can they go they went away you rent to go tell your parents and

156
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,480
 then they just disappeared and the kids like oh shucks what do you want to do now you want to

157
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,760
 kick the can and then ping the dome appears again ping and they start alternating the end and the

158
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,800
 kids are like oh okay now now this is creepy because at the first point they're thinking oh you know

159
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,200
 maybe we're seeing something wrong maybe it's a UFO but once the kid went to go tell their parent

160
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,120
 and it went away it's almost like a stranger in the bushes like hey you want to come play with me

161
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,920
 I'm gonna go tell my mom and then he like leaves gets in his van drives away but then you come back

162
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,960
 and you're like oh mom doesn't care you go back he crawls back on the bushes that's creepy so the

163
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,200
 fact that he left to go tell his parents made it stop they're like oh it's kind of a stranger

164
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 danger right and they didn't have a stranger danger back then lights are blinking ships are

165
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:00,640
 coming in and out of existence and then they see the dome ship go 1950s 1950 sound effects it's like

166
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,000
 bobbling like it's attached to a string they see it land in a football field about a half block

167
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,360
 from kermit's house and she goes it's hovering about three feet off the ground so they're like

168
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,560
 come on guys goonies never quit or whatever that stupid saying is they start never say die whatever

169
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,640
 they're running through the yard to get to where the dome is and then they see it they all turn to

170
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,280
 their left or right it doesn't matter it's by kermit's house they see an alien and they describe

171
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,280
 this alien as this it had like a roundish head like a normal normal head big red round eyes

172
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:44,800
 taking up a good portion of its face a big red round mouth it didn't have a nose it had four

173
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,320
 little dots kind of spaced around its cheeks and they said they shimmered like diamonds

174
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:58,400
 it had arms little arms moving around but it had no legs its body actually tapered off like

175
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,600
 Casper the ghost so i know what you're thinking at this point i know what you're thinking at this

176
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,080
 point Jason this is kind of creepy and it's quite bizarre we haven't even gotten started yet so they're

177
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,520
 looking at this Casper ghost just kind of floating there wavy arms just kind of hovering there right

178
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,160
 it's wearing a belt like all ghosts it has to have a fashion accessory it has his belt with a giant

179
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,160
 like mirror type piece of metal on it super bright the kids are like oh i can't see i can't see and

180
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,120
 then one of the kids in the group is like looking at the alien and he's like yeah that's nothing

181
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,080
 he looks at the dome UFO in the in the football field and he goes that's the most beautiful thing

182
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,800
 i've ever seen and he starts walking towards the domed UFO and two of the but everyone's staring

183
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,960
 at this ghost he's not chill and not a ghost whatever whatever it was alien ghost maybe the

184
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,920
 ghost of an alien who knows anyways this thing's floating around the corner there and everyone's

185
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,840
 staring at that one kid leaves the group starts walking over there two of the older kids see what's

186
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,080
 going to happen see him walking towards the ship they have to run they have to tackle the kid they

187
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,640
 can't keep him from walking towards the ship once they tackle him multiple UFOs began appearing in

188
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:22,880
 the neighborhood one lands on a nearby roof of a house one knocks off the branch of a tree

189
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,560
 a walnut tree to be specific and then one seems to fly by and shoot out some sort of ray

190
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:36,800
 now at this point the kids are screaming out loud because they've seen the alien guy hanging

191
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,400
 around the corner they've had to tackle one of their buddies all these things are blinking in

192
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,840
 and out of existence their parents and other people in the neighborhood come out to see what's going

193
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,680
 on and they don't see anything they don't see a little ghost man mommy mommy know there's a guy

194
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,800
 over there he has a weird belt buckle ah it's blinding me it's blinding me she looks over there

195
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,720
 it's a shrub with a shiny ant on it she's like oh that's just an ant they don't see the UFOs flying

196
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
 around they don't see the landed UFO they just see their kids like freaking out in the front yard

197
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,640
 the parents have no idea what they're looking at but these UFOs are bing bing bing flying all around

198
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,760
 dudes are getting tackled kermit's ready to wrestle an alien all the kids are freaking out

199
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:27,120
 and then one of the kids turns around and in a you got all this chaos going around right

200
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:36,320
 he turns around and out of thin air he sees an arm just like cut off at the shoulder it's like the

201
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,960
 rest of the body is invisible and there's just an arm reaching out of reality and it's beckoning

202
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,040
 him towards it it'd be like if you cut a hole through a curtain and stuck your arm through it

203
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,640
 but that curtain happened to be existence and it wasn't a alien arm it wasn't a human arm it was a

204
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,400
 metallic armored arm and it's just beckoning a child over towards it now there's drawings of the

205
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,320
 arm and what it reminded me of is you know how we'll put our not we because we're not professionals

206
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,280
 but you know how professionals will put their arms in those things to kind of control like radioactive

207
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,800
 isotopes and like move aids from one vial to another they have to use like those mechanical arms

208
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,480
 or they at least put their hands in gloves and you know like you see them in movies where they're

209
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,840
 like reaching into a box that's what it looked like but it was this like metal sleeve over an arm

210
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,280
 with fingers beckoning the kid over he doesn't go he doesn't he's like i'm not going over there the

211
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,240
 arm's like snaps its fingers it's like dang it it disappears a dude appears in the field and other

212
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,200
 kids looking out in the field and there's just some guy now there's just some random normal looking

213
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
 human walk he was considered he was called a strange man so it wasn't one of the ghost guys

214
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 this is all happening in the middle afternoon by the way there's a man walking around now by the

215
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,320
 ufo he pulls out two guns he goes jew jew doesn't make the noises actually shoots two kids and they

216
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,280
 get paralyzed now i know what you're thinking at this point because i was thinking the same thing

217
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,360
 i can understand if the if the parents walked outside and the kids are like oh no it's an alien

218
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
 and the kids the parents look around the corner and they go that's weird there's nothing there my

219
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,920
 kids must just be imagining stuff but if you were a parent and you walked outside and your kids are

220
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,080
 running around they're going oh my god no aliens are getting us i would think they were playing

221
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,160
 around if i saw a branch fall off of a walnut tree you're like oh no my walnuts if i saw a branch

222
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,200
 get knocked off a walnut tree if i saw two kids running and then go paralyzed and hit the ground

223
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,560
 i'm not going to be like oh those those rap scallions oh they're just playing around i'd be like

224
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,880
 oh you know that they always play that game loss of central nervous system oh it's just an

225
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,320
 old thing we used to play that as kids too you would go oh no there's some sort of emergency going on

226
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,680
 but apparently okay so let me finish the story let me finish the story so two kids get shot with

227
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,080
 paralysis ray and i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you this right now before i keep going this isn't

228
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:08,560
 from backpackerverse this story is from several reputable ufo sources not even just websites but

229
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,480
 from ufo literature okay so it's there's no twist to the ending where i'm like surprised i found out

230
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:24,400
 it was invented in 2018 no this story goes back to 1955 when it was reported so where did i leave

231
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,400
 off because it still isn't even the weirdest part yet two kids get paralyzed walnut tree is

232
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,240
 destroyed or branch broken off you have the mechanical arm still we're coming up to this is

233
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,680
 the my favorite part this is hands down my favorite part so now the ship the dome ship in the distance

234
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,000
 a portal opens up like a little doorway right and out comes another alien now this alien looks has

235
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,040
 the same head as the alien who was hiding behind the corner has the big red eyes big red mouth a

236
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,440
 little diamond little like red things that sparkle like diamonds but he has two arms but at the elbow

237
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,480
 it becomes two more arms so he has four hand like four four arms four hands on each like he has a

238
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,400
 like a shoulder to elbow and then the arm splits and his body doesn't taper down like a little

239
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,840
 caster ghost he has four tendrils he just kind of hovers above the ground upside of the ship he's

240
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,280
 just hovering above the ground with his weirdo arms and his weirdo legs and then there's a kid

241
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
 there we have a names a few of these kids we had kermit we have this kid his name is ronnie stricklin

242
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:37,040
 he said that the alien telepathically told him hey go climb that tree we'll pick you up in 15 minutes

243
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:44,960
 and he's like yes master yes and he starts walking towards the tree now an other kid as well must

244
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,160
 have gotten the command because an other kid starts walking towards the tree with ronnie now you have

245
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,440
 all of this chaos going on so kids are trying to just not get paralyzed themselves trying to save

246
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,920
 their walnut trees they're like this is for my science fair project no everyone's it's basically

247
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,920
 every man for themselves so they don't see what ronnie and this other kid are doing at first

248
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:11,680
 but they do end up climbing a tree and they sit up there for 15 minutes so this story supposedly

249
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,080
 took place between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. this was going on i know i've been kind of saying then this

250
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,680
 happens and this happens supposedly all of these events took three hours from beginning to end

251
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,520
 these must be the worst parents in the world who they're like oh yeah you know kids love to play

252
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,320
 the same game for three hours i love to play paralyzed on the ground that's such a popular game

253
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,880
 they saw on leave it for beaver oh they love playing that game where they're just petrified

254
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,760
 pointing at nothing going please mommy help me oh it's such a great game this goes on for three

255
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,920
 hours so they are waiting up in the tree for 15 minutes and then you still have this core group

256
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,680
 of kids and they're trying to get this is my favorite part of the story they're trying to get the kids

257
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,760
 down from the tree they're like no ronnie no other kid get down get down from the tree i don't know

258
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
 if it's the same tree as the walnut tree that would be hilarious the other branches getting ready to

259
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,080
 break they're like no no i eat walnuts i have to forge those before winter we're going to hibernation

260
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,920
 and their kids are just sitting up in the tree so then after 15 minutes a ufo comes down and they

261
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,080
 said it's shaped like Saturn so it had like a ball in the middle and this ring around it okay this

262
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,800
 is so great i love this oh did i tell you i didn't i did i should say this right now um put you in a

263
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,280
 little bit of suspense here but i want to make sure i give credit i have read this story this weekend

264
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,240
 and then just the other day chop top on youtube said hey have you ever heard the story of the

265
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,640
 casablanca entities and i was like i just read that story but i wanted to give him credit so chop

266
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,960
 top thank you for recommending this story he definitely sped it along i probably would have

267
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
 waited a little bit longer to do this but i want to give i want to give you guys credit when credit

268
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,320
 is due so back to the story there's this hovering ball there's this ball with like this Saturn like

269
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,120
 ring right and Ronnie and this other kid are standing in this tree sitting in this tree now

270
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,960
 little dudes a little little Martian guys are now walking out of the ufo and they're like hanging

271
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,520
 off of the Saturn ring reaching for the boys they're like come on get in the ship get in the ship

272
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,640
 and Ronnie and the other kid are like hypnotically trying to reach for the aliens

273
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,800
 and their friends are like oh my god we're about to watch your friends get kidnapped go to another

274
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,120
 planet so how do you get kids out of a tree how do you let me rephrase it how do you quickly get

275
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,480
 kids out of the tree my scenario would be just throw stuff at them but i'm an adult so i could

276
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,200
 throw hard enough to knock a kid out of a tree i could be like oh this rock will do it and just

277
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,520
 like hit him in the ribs and be like but a kid can't throw that hard so they go and they grab a hose

278
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,200
 right they go and they grab a hose and they're like hit it and they turn the water on and they

279
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,760
 shoot him they're in a tree they're blasting these kids with the hose thinking actually

280
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,320
 they're not trying to knock the kids out of the tree they're trying to wake them up so don't throw

281
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,080
 rocks if a kid is hypnotized in a tree they start blasting their friends with this hose

282
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,080
 and Ronnie's like what he wakes up from his hypnosis and he sees these little guys like

283
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,760
 hanging off of the ship and they're like we'll get you next time and Ronnie climbs down the tree

284
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,040
 but the other kid is still hypnotized and they're just blasting this kid with this hose and then

285
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:28,800
 and then finally he does he falls he falls out of the tree the aliens can't get him so he falls

286
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:38,320
 out of the tree and then floats through i love this he falls out of the tree he doesn't hit the

287
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:48,480
 ground he floats across the yard and lands on a roof lands on a roof safely so somehow he fell

288
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,000
 he started fall he levitates he goes back up because the tree is not as tall as the house

289
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,840
 i'm assuming unless it's this giant tree he falls out of the tree he slowly levitates he ends up

290
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:13,440
 on the top of the house walks off the house he walks off the house after just being magically

291
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,400
 levitated across the yard these kids are watching their friend they're about to see him fall out of

292
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,480
 the tree they're like oh no and then something catches him he slowly glides through the air they're

293
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:35,040
 like oh good and then he just takes a step and falls off the house he lands on his head he falls off

294
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,280
 a two-story house presumably even a one-story house but he falls off the house he lands right on his

295
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:53,040
 head and then all the UFOs disappear so that is the story of the Casablanca entities and i'm

296
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,640
 reading that i read about it on the cryptopia website which has been a huge resource for this

297
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,680
 show in the past like week or two i found a lot of great stories from that and i read it and i go

298
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,480
 this there's no way this story is true and i actually had a really hard time finding backup

299
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,280
 resources for it and i thought this is the only site where i could find the story i go this is

300
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,400
 the most likely fake or the author's just having a joke maybe there's an april fool's story or

301
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,160
 something like that but i spent like the past two days every so often i'd kind of go back to it

302
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,200
 looking for references and he mentioned a couple authors and he's like this UFO author covered

303
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,640
 this story but he wasn't really saying what sources i could find it at and so right before i decided

304
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,440
 to do this story today because i was talking to chop-top on youtube decided to do the story today

305
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,640
 and originally i was going to say there's only one source for this it's this one website but

306
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,720
 i went back revisited his article found the name of an author typed in that name of the

307
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,880
 ardor Casablanca entities found a paper he wrote that includes this story along with very well

308
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,200
 known UFO story the kelly hopkins story the hopkinsville story or whatever kelly's what it

309
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,840
 doesn't matter it's a little goblin story that's fairly well known that there's a house and a

310
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,880
 bunch of goblins attack it kelly hopskin it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the point is is that as

311
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:19,200
 stupid as the story is it's very very obscure but it is listed with by it is written about by

312
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,320
 reputable authors once i was able to get that author's name a bunch of resources popped up i

313
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,400
 think Casablanca is just such a generic name it was really hard to find this stuff but once i was

314
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,040
 able to match Casablanca to the author's name found article after article after article detailing

315
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:43,760
 this stuff from again established UFO websites so is this story true again i don't want to sound

316
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,880
 like a broken record but either they're making it up someone else made it up they're misinterpreting

317
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,320
 real life events or it's true i think those are always the four things we can look at with this

318
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,040
 type of story there's no evidence we could go out to see if there's a walnut tree with no branch

319
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,440
 but let's assume just for the sake of fun that it's true because again we can't really prove it

320
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,480
 either way there is a i had to read this article multiple times and i had to read a bunch of resources

321
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:19,680
 on it there is a through line in this story that makes it genuinely terrifying every single thing

322
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:26,000
 that the aliens do let's presume they're aliens every single thing the aliens do once they show up

323
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,040
 is to divide and conquer the ghost shown up around the corner of the house distracted all the kids

324
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,880
 so the one kid would start walking towards the ship and while people were focusing on getting the

325
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,920
 kid from walking towards the ship the mechanical arm appeared to the one child beckoning him over

326
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,360
 there the alien comes out with the guns to paralyze two kids whittling their number down from eight

327
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,840
 to six you had the two kids hypnotized instead of hypnotizing all of them it was almost like they

328
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,800
 simply wanted any one of those children no one was the particular target but it was all about

329
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:11,920
 distraction and attraction it was a hunt the fact that the parents couldn't see anything makes it even

330
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,080
 more creepy because what child wants to live in a world where they are surrounded by dangers that

331
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,320
 are invisible to the people who can protect them the most this story has never been replicated as

332
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:32,640
 far as i know there's never been such a massive alien presence in a neighborhood really in two

333
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:42,720
 yards in a football field and a home there's nothing that parallels this why did this happen

334
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,000
 in that neighborhood has it happened since or before but more importantly is that a viable

335
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,760
 hunting strategy i mean it could have worked in almost any other location a campsite where a kid

336
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,000
 is lured off into the bushes another neighborhood where kids don't play in groups but just a kid

337
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,680
 walking home alone that's terrifying because it doesn't seem like they're after anyone particular

338
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,840
 it seems like they were the alien equivalent of a human predator any child will do

339
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,760
 so for all the fun and all the ridiculous stuff that happens in that story that's the terrifying

340
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:37,520
 throughline they were hunting and they came close several times but hunters rarely give up

341
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,080
 they may move where they hunt they may change tactics but eventually

342
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,560
 they'll bring home that trophy dead rabbit radio gmail.com is going to be our email address you
