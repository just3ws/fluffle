1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
 What does it take to remove the spookiest tree in the world?

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,920
 How far would you go for your art?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,720
 And then we cover a bizarre new conspiracy theory that I just thought of.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,240
 Just thought of this one last week, but it's been sticking to my head.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,880
 Is it possible that cryptids are actually-

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,400
 [laughs]

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,240
 This is when you know there's only two episodes left of the season.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,720
 Is it possible when this type of insanity comes out?

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:42,000
 Is it possible that cryptids are actually old-timey drug users today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,520
 [music]

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,240
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,720
 There is only two episodes left of season 14 after I record this one and tomorrow's one,

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,280
 which I'm going to record back to back.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,200
 I'm doing these on the same day.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,920
 I get to take three weeks off.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
 The show will be back in the first week of August.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
 We'll be back.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,040
 And though, we will have a live stream on YouTube, so subscribe to the YouTube channel.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,720
 On July 18th, we are going to have an alien invasion live stream brought to you by a quiet

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,680
 place part two.

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,880
 Join the live stream, ask me some questions, get your bowl of strawberry ice cream ready

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,440
 as we wait for the alien invaders that are predicted to come show up.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,120
 I don't expect they're going to, but we're going to have a bowl anyways.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,400
 And if you do miss the live stream, I will be including that audio.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,960
 I will be uploading that audio to the podcast channel as well.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,600
 I think it'll be a good, fun time waiting for aliens.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,480
 But let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,560
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, walking in is a longtime Patreon supporter.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
 Sister Celestine.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,640
 Everyone give a round of applause to Sister Celestine.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
 I imagine she's hovering.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
 She doesn't seem like she would be walking.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,080
 That seems so earthly.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,960
 She's floating around in Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,680
 Sister Celestine, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,480
 We are heading on out to Bentonville, Illinois.

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,920
 Sister Celestine, she's just floating next to the Durgible.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,280
 She's towing it with a rope wrapped around her neck.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,200
 She's flying us out to Bentonville, Illinois.

44
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,960
 Specifically, we're headed to the Peoria State Hospital.

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,160
 It's shut down now.

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
 It's shut down now.

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 There's no longer an operation.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,920
 There's just a bunch of old spooky buildings sitting on this plot of land.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,600
 But in the early 1900s, Peoria State Hospital was known by a different name.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,160
 The Illinois Asylum for the Incurable Insane, which would suck, right?

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,200
 Which would suck if you're getting taken there.

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,600
 You're like, "I'm slightly insane, but maybe things will work out."

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,240
 And as you see the car pulling up, you see the sign, you're like, "Oh man, I wanted to

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
 go to the accurable one."

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,320
 But no, sir, you are incurably insane.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,840
 It's 1900, so that could just mean that you had a headache that wouldn't go away.

57
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,440
 Everyone, you were just locked up if you were even slightly insane.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,720
 But this place, it's interesting because we've covered a couple of insane asylums on this

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,880
 podcast because they tend to be haunted, right?

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,560
 So this one fell into the kind hands of Dr. George A. Zeller.

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,200
 And for the early 1900s, he was considered like, "If you were going to go to any, if

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,640
 you were going to go to any mental institution, you'd want to go to this one."

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,360
 Even though it would mean you were incurably insane, he actually was ahead of his time

64
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,360
 as far as treating people who mainly, by treating them, not just going, "I wonder what happens

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,080
 if we put this much electricity in their brain?"

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,440
 He actually, by all accounts, seemed to be a pretty good guy.

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,280
 He's the one who said, "Hey, I know that we already have all those business cards made

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,680
 up that said Illinois is silent for the incurable insane."

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 But we shouldn't call it that, right?

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
 We shouldn't call it that.

71
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,080
 He's running the hospital.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,200
 He hasn't changed to Peoria State Hospital.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,920
 It's a much more hopeful name.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,400
 But anyways, he was all about helping people.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,840
 This is a pretty big campus.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,920
 You can still go there.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,440
 Some of it's office buildings now.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,120
 Would you want to work in an office building that you're like, "Oh man, my job totally

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 sucks."

80
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,200
 You look over and there's like a bloodstained wall and chains hanging there.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,600
 Because even though he did his best to treat the patients, there still were a bunch of

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 insane people there.

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
 Okay, I don't know.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 I don't know if it looked like a farsight cartoon with chains hanging off the wall.

85
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,120
 Even a well-run insane asylum, I wouldn't want to work there.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,640
 I wouldn't want to be at a call center in there, right?

87
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
 But now it's office buildings.

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,320
 You may, your attorney, if you live in Illinois, your attorney may be working out of an insane

89
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,040
 asylum, former insane asylum.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
 Some of the buildings are gone.

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,480
 Some of the buildings are now used as small business buildings.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,560
 And then other buildings are just spooky, spooky buildings on the property.

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,680
 And there's four separate cemeteries on this plot of land as well.

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,560
 And one of the things Dr. George said was we want to kind of get, like having a job as

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,400
 part of the human condition.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,720
 Having a job, having something to do, I mean even animal species do it.

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,680
 If people aren't working, it's kind of weird.

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,520
 We would like to just sit back and retire, but even people who retire like to continue

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
 to work.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,480
 Ants, bugs, stuff like that, they need jobs.

101
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 Humans need jobs.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,680
 Everything needs, everyone needs a job.

103
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,020
 Even if the job is digging a ditch and then someone else filling the ditch in, we need

104
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
 something to do.

105
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,520
 So he thought about that and he goes, "We can even get all of these insane people."

106
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
 He wasn't calling them insane people, right?

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,600
 He's a little more kindhearted than I'm going to be.

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
 And he goes, "You know what?

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
 We have all of this labor.

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,680
 There are these patients here and there's different levels of insanity, right?

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,200
 Like you don't want the guy who's stabbing his relatives.

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,160
 You're like, "You'd be a great gardener.

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
 Here's some shears."

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,120
 But they go, "Let's take some of these people who are in the Insane Asylum who can't, we

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
 can't let out because they're incurably insane, but let's put on a work."

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,600
 He had them working, which actually now I'm thinking about it, but it would totally suck.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
 What if you're insane due to like you're a workaholic and you're like, "You have a

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 nervous breakdown.

119
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,480
 Your family's like, "We love you, Daddy, but we got to put you in the asylum because

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,240
 you just won't stop working and your job is trying to murder us."

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,400
 So then you figure you're going to go to the Insane Asylum and just kind of chill.

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,480
 We kind of chill acts for a while as people are screaming in your ears.

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 That's just the nurse.

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
 That's just the staff.

125
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,160
 And then when you try to sleep, the inmates are just ripping out your clothes.

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
 You're sitting there and you're like, "Ah, finally some peace and quiet.

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,440
 The screams of a thousand main acts."

128
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,040
 I don't know where I'm going with this, but I mean, my biggest fear is being locked up

129
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
 in an Insane Asylum.

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,960
 I've talked about that on the show.

131
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,200
 Being locked up in an Insane Asylum.

132
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,080
 But the one thing I could do is like, maybe I could do a bunch of puzzles or do crosswords

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,320
 and stuff like that, but no.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,640
 Now I have a totally different view of this Dr. George guy because if I'm locked up in

135
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,560
 an Insane Asylum, I don't want to do nothing.

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,240
 I just want to sit and be insane.

137
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,760
 He made him work.

138
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
 He made him work.

139
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now that I'm thinking about it, that's kind of like slavery because these people couldn't

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 leave.

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,200
 Man, so anyways, the first story I'm going to be thinking of Dr. George as a slave driver.

142
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,360
 I just want to sit back and be insane.

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,440
 But he put together these work crews and he had these work crews for all sorts of jobs.

144
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
 One of them was the cemetery job.

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,080
 And there was a guy named Manuel Bookbinder.

146
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,120
 That wasn't his actual name.

147
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,600
 He was mute and nobody knew what his actual name was.

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,640
 But apparently before he came to the asylum, he was a Bookbinder.

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,520
 I don't know where Manuel came from because every job was Manuel back then.

150
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
 It's not Manuel like, hey Manuel, like a manual.

151
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
 His name is just manual, like working on stuff.

152
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,240
 Or, who I wrote in town raw.

153
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,280
 And his name might have been a manual.

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,040
 But the point is, one, this is the second last episode of the season.

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
 And they usually get this weird.

156
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,720
 Last season I was singing Nickelodeon songs.

157
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,120
 This one, there's a guy named Manuel Bookbinder.

158
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,520
 AKA Old Book.

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,480
 That's what everyone called him because they didn't know if his name meant that he was

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 manual labor.

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,560
 But anyways, he's a mute man.

162
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,320
 He's in his 20s.

163
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,520
 And they go, hey, how would you like to be a grave digger?

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
 And he can't answer.

165
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
 He's just sitting there.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,960
 He's mute and they're like, perfect.

167
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
 He's like, oh man, you didn't let me grab my chalkboard.

168
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,560
 So he becomes the grave digger.

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
 That's his job.

170
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,040
 He's a very, very simple man.

171
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,600
 So he would go out there.

172
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
 He would dig the grave.

173
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,880
 And then they would hold the funeral.

174
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,800
 Old Book would watch from an elm tree.

175
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,240
 He would stand there leaning against this elm tree, just sobbing heavily.

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,360
 Sobbing heavily at the loss of another human life.

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,680
 He was deeply affected by death.

178
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,440
 He's watching these people being buried.

179
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,040
 And he's probably sobbing because he's like, oh man, I gotta fill that grave back in.

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,280
 Oh, I've been insane at a lazy prison.

181
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,520
 People loved Old Book.

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,080
 He was like just a really good guy.

183
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,360
 They're like, hey, dude, how's it going?

184
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
 He's just walking by.

185
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
 He's mute.

186
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,960
 They're like, yeah, same to you, buddy.

187
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
 But he dies pretty young.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,760
 He dies at the age 32.

189
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,040
 And everyone showed up to his funeral.

190
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,200
 It said 400 people showed up to his funeral.

191
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
 Everyone loved Old Book.

192
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,280
 He was such a nice guy.

193
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,240
 So everyone was there.

194
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,920
 And the pallbearers are carrying Old Book's casket to his grave.

195
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
 And then all of a sudden, they go, huh?

196
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
 What?

197
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
 What?

198
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
 Do you feel that?

199
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 The other guy goes, I feel that.

200
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,400
 And the third guy goes, he's insane.

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,760
 He's totally incurable and sane.

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,400
 They're like, we gotta get another pallbearer.

203
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,440
 But then the fourth pallbearer goes, I feel it too, guys.

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,080
 All of a sudden, Old Book's casket got lighter.

205
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,920
 It felt like it was empty.

206
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:12,760
 And then, echoing across the graveyard, they hear a deep, sobbing cry.

207
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,360
 [CRYING]

208
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,600
 And everyone can't figure out where it's coming from.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,760
 They turn and they realize that the sound is coming from the old elm tree that manual

210
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,680
 Bookbinder always stood next to.

211
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:45,880
 400 witnesses, including Dr. George Zeller, who was at this funeral, saw Old Book leaning

212
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,240
 against the elm tree sobbing.

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,480
 [CRYING]

214
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,320
 The crowd was so certain that that was actually what they were seeing.

215
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:08,720
 They actually put down his coffin and opened it up, just to be sure that Old Book was dead.

216
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,520
 When they opened the coffin up, there they saw the body of manual Bookbinder and the

217
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:22,600
 crying stopped.

218
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,880
 Now beyond being a ghost story that has 400 witnesses, this was actually Dr. Zeller wrote

219
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
 this down in his journal that day.

220
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,880
 Dear Diary, today was the spookiest day in the insane asylum, and that's saying a lot.

221
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,720
 He wrote in his journal about seeing the specter of Old Book, but the story, the ghost story

222
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 doesn't end there.

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
 It actually just starts there.

224
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:57,720
 Because now as a spirit, Old Book continued to appear, or at least his voice did.

225
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,320
 Days after manual Bookbinder was buried, the elm tree began to show signs that it was quickly

226
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 dying.

227
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,960
 It's a fire hazard that can fall on people, so they gotta get rid of it.

228
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:19,000
 So people go out to chop it down, and as they get close to it, someone's looking at

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
 each other and they're like, "Do you hear that?

230
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 The tree is crying."

231
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 That's kind of weird, right?

232
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,040
 And trees don't normally do that.

233
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,960
 I've heard of the weeping willow, but this is ridiculous.

234
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,080
 And everyone's like, "Oh, come on."

235
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,200
 So anyway, he goes through there's only two episodes left, man.

236
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
 What do you expect?

237
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,280
 They're like, "What are you talking about?"

238
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,520
 One of the guys goes, "Crying tree or no crying tree?

239
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 We got a job to do."

240
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,960
 And he takes an axe and he swings it down.

241
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,360
 This tree is haunted.

242
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 Come on.

243
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,840
 They know that this tree is associated with a man who just died and his ghost appeared

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,480
 in front of 400 people.

245
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,840
 But this dude, this guy, he was in the insane asylum for chopping people with axes.

246
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 He's like, "I don't care.

247
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,120
 I don't care if manual Bookbinder was standing here alive.

248
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
 I'm chopping this tree down."

249
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,440
 And when he takes his axe and he swings it into the tree, the second that blade cuts

250
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,400
 into the mighty Elm's bark, everyone around the tree said that it sounded like a man wailing

251
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,960
 as if a human being had been hit with an axe.

252
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,560
 Again, all of these people are in insane asylum.

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,520
 More than one of them have probably hit a guy with an axe at some point.

254
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,240
 They're like, "Ah, memories.

255
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
 Ah, memories.

256
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,800
 That reminds me of that time I hit my boss in the head with that hatchet."

257
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,680
 So at this point, they go, "Okay, that's terrifying."

258
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,240
 The guys still trying to chop it down.

259
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,080
 They're like, "Barnie, Barney, no.

260
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 Don't do it.

261
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 We don't know what's going to happen."

262
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,560
 So they decide not to chop down the tree because there's something spooky going on.

263
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
 It's crying.

264
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,960
 It's screaming as if it's a man getting chopped by a tree.

265
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
 But they have to get rid of the tree.

266
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,360
 So they hold this little meeting and they go, "On the one hand, this tree may possess

267
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:03,480
 the spirit of good old book, a good hearted man who never did anyone any harm.

268
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,240
 But on the other hand, let's burn it."

269
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
 Right?

270
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,520
 That was the other thing they came to do because they got to get rid of the tree.

271
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,160
 So maybe it has the spirit of gentle book, but they want to burn it.

272
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
 They just want to set it on fire.

273
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,440
 So they go and they go to set it on fire and it begins screaming so loudly that people

274
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
 have to put it out.

275
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 Right?

276
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,400
 People, more cooler heads prevail and they're like, "The tree may be dying and it may be

277
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,040
 a health hazard to make fall on somebody at some point, but at some point that may happen.

278
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,560
 Right now, it sounds like a screaming man on fire."

279
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,640
 So they put out the fire.

280
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,840
 The tree looked like it was dying, but it never died.

281
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 It just sat there for the longest time.

282
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,760
 And people were too afraid to remove it because who knows what was going to happen.

283
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,840
 But one day, it was finally removed by nature itself.

284
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,920
 Lightning struck the tree and completely split it.

285
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,640
 And at that point, they were able to remove it and it made no sounds.

286
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,380
 Now, Dr. Zeller ended up writing a book called "Befriending the Bereft," which I actually

287
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,760
 tried finding a copy of.

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,360
 It goes for like hundreds of dollars now.

289
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,560
 It's been out of print for a long time, but he wrote a book called "Befriending the Bereft"

290
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,720
 and it's Dr. Zeller's experiences at Peoria State Hospital.

291
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,840
 He's talking about, "Oh, I remember this one guy, he was such a cut up.

292
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,040
 He was always cutting up other patients, but he did it in such a funny way."

293
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,800
 He's telling these stories about, "He wasn't making fun of the patients.

294
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
 I would pay hundreds of dollars.

295
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,640
 I would pay hundreds of dollars for that.

296
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
 I would start to go fund me."

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,920
 If it was the book of a doctor of an insane asylum, just racking, doing a roast on all

298
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
 these people, you know.

299
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,080
 He talks about his time and rehabilitating people and the friendships that he made and

300
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,200
 the stuff he learned, but there are parts of the book that are spooky stories.

301
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 The description of that I've seen of the book says the book is about his life working at

302
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,560
 these state hospitals, but they also contain anecdotes of creepy things he ran into and

303
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,440
 one of them is the story of Old Book.

304
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,120
 The stuff about seeing the apparition of Old Book at the graveyard is apparently in the

305
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,000
 book befriending the bereft.

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,800
 I don't know if the story of removing the tree is as well.

307
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,760
 That might be, but I know for sure they've sourced the story of Old Book himself from

308
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
 this book befriending the bereft.

309
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,560
 So interesting story.

310
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,000
 Imagine reading a book about the psychology of inmates and all of a sudden you turn the

311
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
 page and it becomes an R.L.

312
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,200
 Stein novel.

313
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,920
 But that's apparently what befriending the bereft was.

314
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,600
 Nowadays, you can actually visit the Peoria State Hospital.

315
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,320
 Most of the buildings are either private or demolished.

316
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,280
 However, you can still go see Old Book's grave.

317
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,160
 It's grave number 713 because they weren't putting names on the graves.

318
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
 There were so many of them.

319
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,200
 Obviously, there were 713 of them.

320
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
 But that's the story of Old Book.

321
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,680
 A man who was a simple man, but he couldn't understand death.

322
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,200
 He filled him with such grief that that grief infused the environment around him.

323
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,160
 And I would say that it was his grief, because I believe that a lot of ghost stuff could just

324
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,400
 be emotional energy.

325
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,280
 Infusing an area, what I find fascinating is that the tree was reacting to it trying

326
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
 to be removed.

327
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
 So it wasn't just the recording of his grief.

328
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,600
 You could actually interact with it.

329
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
 Maybe there's a little seed.

330
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,680
 Maybe there's a little elm tree seed in the soil right now and it has like a, it wiggles,

331
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
 goes "inginging".

332
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
 Maybe.

333
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
 Dude, why don't it be creepy thing about this?

334
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,560
 It's what our conspiracy cap's on real quick.

335
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,360
 Imagine that elm tree and there's like a seed and it falls out of the, I have no idea how

336
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 elm tree seeds work.

337
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
 I don't even think I could pick an elm tree out of a line of trees.

338
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
 Say that an elm tree has a seed, because I'm sure that it does.

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,320
 And then a little seed, a little seed falls off of this elm tree.

340
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,400
 And as the lightning strikes it, the little seed like goes "woo" and it falls and then

341
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,280
 it rolls around on the ground.

342
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,800
 And then like a insane person picks it up and goes "okay".

343
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,680
 He puts it in his pocket.

344
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,320
 That's his insanity.

345
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,800
 And he likes picking up seeds.

346
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 My point is, that wasn't the end of the story.

347
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 This is what I'm trying to get at, but I'm getting confused.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,200
 It's getting really hot in my recording studio.

349
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,560
 What if a haunted tree produced this haunted seed is what I'm trying to say?

350
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,400
 Like what if there's a seed out there like two tastes of the stories from like 1910.

351
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,920
 I don't think there's a haunted seed still out there.

352
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,800
 But seeds last a while, right?

353
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 Don't they?

354
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,200
 Like if you took an acorn and you put it in a vault for a thousand years, a thousand

355
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,240
 years later couldn't you be like "ha ha, now it's time to plant you"?

356
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
 Let's say that that's true.

357
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,480
 Let's say that that's true, even though I don't know.

358
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
 I imagine it's hard, right?

359
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,880
 So like it wouldn't decay because it's too hard.

360
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,280
 It's kind of like a rock, but it's a seed.

361
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,120
 No, number one science podcast in El Salvador by the way.

362
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,480
 So anyways, it's not anymore.

363
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,840
 We've been steadily dropping down the ranking since I announced this was the number one

364
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,120
 science podcast on El Salvador, which was true at the time.

365
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,120
 It is steadily dropping down.

366
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,360
 I really think the community of El Salvador got together and they're like "no way dude,

367
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,240
 we gotta, we gotta, we gotta, we have to remove this from our country's reputation."

368
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,740
 If you took this one, getting that.

369
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,040
 We're not going to be able to talk about the artist story.

370
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,560
 I'm not going to have time for it because I want to finish this.

371
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,080
 What if you took a haunted, you have a haunted tree.

372
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,440
 You take a haunted seed from it and then you plant it.

373
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
 Would that tree be haunted?

374
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,560
 Well, it's the same thing.

375
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,200
 If you had a haunted house, think about this.

376
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,000
 If you had a haunted house and you removed the wood from it and then you put new wood

377
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,320
 on it, is the house still haunted?

378
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,080
 And then if you took the old wood and then you built a new house with using the old wood,

379
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,760
 is which house is the haunted?

380
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 Jesus.

381
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 Stop.

382
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,640
 Just seriously stop dude.

383
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,160
 I'm about to unsubscribe.

384
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,000
 Think of which house would be the haunted house.

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,360
 Would they both be haunted?

386
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,080
 Would the ghost be like between the two?

387
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,640
 It's a vacation house.

388
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,880
 It's like "see you guys later.

389
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,560
 I gotta go haunted this family in Connecticut."

390
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,640
 That's what I love about topics like this and I talked about it yesterday too.

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,080
 It's just exploring the ideas.

392
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
 Exploring the ideas.

393
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,400
 If you had a haunted object and you get a tree, a haunted tree is interesting because

394
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,560
 it's continuing to produce.

395
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,800
 Dude, what if a demon possessed person had a baby?

396
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,360
 Would the baby be demonically possessed?

397
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 Little devil.

398
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,320
 It's like who's that little devil character that used to run with Casper?

399
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,960
 It's a little baby with horns.

400
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
 You can do this for hours.

401
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,640
 I'm going to continue to do it after the podcast talk.

402
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,920
 You're thinking about it but right now.

403
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,320
 So I'm just saying like what if there's a whole forest of haunted trees out there now?

404
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
 Haunted Elm trees.

405
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,560
 Bunch of old books in them.

406
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,900
 Even at night when you're walking through the forest you think you're just hearing the

407
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,560
 wind blowing through the trees but instead you're hearing a hundred moans.

408
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,560
 The crying of a man lost forever.

409
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:20,560
 Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

410
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,920
 I see it kind of spooky.

411
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,880
 See you didn't expect to get spooky right?

412
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Like you thought it was uplifting?

413
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,560
 You're like chasing the story of a man in an insane asylum.

414
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
 Who couldn't speak?

415
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 Couldn't speak?

416
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
 Who died young?

417
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,560
 Possessed a tree and got set on fire.

418
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
 It's not uplifting.

419
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 I would not use the word uplifting to describe any part of that story.

420
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,440
 That was terrifying.

421
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,600
 And sure you made it slightly more terrifying to say that his body, his soul is now split

422
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
 among an entire forest of trees.

423
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,840
 But it already was incredibly unsettling.

424
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
 It wasn't uplifting.

425
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 What type of weirdo?

426
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 What type of lunatic?

427
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:12,560
 You should be in the asylum if you think if you consider that first story to be uplifting.

428
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,720
 Sister Celestine, I gotta outrun my listeners.

429
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,600
 They're about to have me put in the Peoria State Hospital.

430
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
 Fire up that carbonicopter.

431
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
 We are leaving behind Illinois.

432
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 We are heading on out to a forest in the middle of nowhere.

433
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 A bunch of old books.

434
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,440
 A bunch of old books over there.

435
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,360
 I came across this a while back.

436
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,920
 I was on the heroin subreddit.

437
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,200
 Long time listeners of the show know.

438
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 I spend my evenings like when I'm going to bed.

439
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 What am I doing?

440
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,500
 This is such a bizarre Jason trait.

441
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:53,780
 As I'm going to sleep, I go to subreddits of really despondent and despair subcultures.

442
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,160
 For whatever reason I do prefer to bed.

443
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,880
 I go to heroin subreddits, meth subreddits, gambling addicts subreddits which are the

444
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 most depressing.

445
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,120
 Like at least with a heroin user you have something to look forward to.

446
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
 More heroin.

447
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
 You have more heroin.

448
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,560
 But if you don't have more heroin then you're on that journey to get more heroin.

449
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,420
 It's like a Frodo-esque quest.

450
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,820
 Your fellowship of other heroin addicts and trying to score and maybe breaking people's

451
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
 houses.

452
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 Still their DVD players.

453
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,660
 Apparently you live in the year 2003.

454
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,820
 The DVD players still worth money.

455
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
 Gambling addicts are the worst man.

456
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,100
 Those stories are so tragic.

457
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,380
 Because it's one thing to be like "Oh I need 20 bucks to do some smack this morning."

458
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,540
 Versus "I'm $40,000 in debt."

459
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,280
 There are so many posts on this gambling subreddit.

460
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
 I don't remember the name of it.

461
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
 I'll put it on the show notes.

462
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,360
 I don't want to go there.

463
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,160
 There's so many posts that you come across and they're like "I own a loan shark $20,000

464
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,400
 and I don't know what to do."

465
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,080
 And I'm like "Oh that guy's not going to be posting on Reddit for a while."

466
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 That's rough.

467
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,560
 I'll see people lose.

468
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,360
 They'll be like "I lost $400,000 last year."

469
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,580
 Anyways, this is how I go to sleep before I go to bed.

470
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,660
 A while back I came across something on the heroin subreddit.

471
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,140
 Junkies hate water.

472
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,660
 This person who's a heroin user goes "Is it just me or do junkies hate water?"

473
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,540
 And I didn't know that was a thing, but apparently it is because every single junkie, I think

474
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,860
 there's maybe two or three exceptions.

475
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,700
 Everyone else said "Oh no I hate taking baths."

476
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,920
 I can't stand the feeling of showers on me.

477
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,720
 Singing in the rain is a horror movie to me.

478
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,640
 What are you mad?

479
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,360
 Apparently junkies hate water.

480
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,680
 And so that put a little piece of macaroni in my mouth because I started thinking there's

481
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,000
 a lot of things that don't like water.

482
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,920
 There's a few other things that don't like water.

483
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,240
 In my side of the world, the paranormal world.

484
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,540
 People with rabies hate water.

485
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,460
 And a whole host of cryptids and paranormal entities.

486
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,860
 Most famously the vampire.

487
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,660
 But there are other entities out there that if a creature is chasing you, you just cross

488
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,780
 the river and it won't come after you.

489
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
 You see that a lot.

490
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,740
 If it's running water, the creatures won't cross the running water.

491
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,380
 So I started to think, "I wonder if there's anything to this junkies hate water thing?"

492
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,960
 There actually is an interview with William S. Burroughs about heroin addiction.

493
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,400
 And he does confirm that.

494
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,720
 He goes, "Junkies hate water."

495
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,920
 It's something to do with the fact...

496
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,200
 It's like a psychological response to being high on heroin.

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,320
 You don't want to get wet.

498
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,400
 You're going to have to really put your conspiracy caps on and strap them in for this one.

499
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 Because they might pop off of your head and go, "Uhhh."

500
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
 I have a thing.

501
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,420
 And hanging out with me is like hanging out with a toddler.

502
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,460
 Because I'm always asking questions.

503
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,020
 And the number one question that I always have is, "How did this start?"

504
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
 How did this start?

505
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,420
 There's a huge fire and molding a match.

506
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,860
 I was like, "How did this start?"

507
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,260
 No, when I think of stuff, I go, "Who was the first person to do this?"

508
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
 Who was the first person?

509
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,220
 And I've mentioned that several times on the show.

510
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,220
 I don't think I've explicitly said how much I'm obsessed with origins.

511
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,460
 But early on in the show, it was like, "Who was the first person to ever drink milk out

512
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,860
 of a cow?"

513
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,080
 Like somebody was.

514
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,200
 Somebody goes, "Well, I'm drinking milk out of my mom's boob."

515
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,080
 Not actively when I was a baby.

516
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,560
 So that cow has boobs.

517
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,360
 Maybe I can drink that too.

518
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,560
 Or shamans going off.

519
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,920
 I mean, how many thousands of shamans died trying to go on a vision quest and they ate

520
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,560
 poison and someone goes, "Oh, don't eat that bush.

521
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
 That'll kill you."

522
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,920
 I'm always interested in who the first person to do stuff is.

523
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,280
 A while back, we did an episode about virgin boy eggs.

524
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,800
 And I didn't really get to the origin of it.

525
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,060
 Nobody knows why they started cooking virgin boy eggs.

526
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,980
 If you missed that episode in this province in China, they take a hard boiled egg, damn

527
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
 Jason.

528
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
 I did listen to that episode.

529
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,480
 It was super disgusting.

530
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,100
 And I hoped you'd never bring it back up.

531
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,060
 They take hard boiled eggs in China.

532
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,660
 They boil them in the urine of boys who are under the age of 10.

533
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,740
 And then they crack them open and boil them some more so it soaks in all the urine and

534
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
 then they eat them.

535
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,720
 When I was doing research on it, nobody knows why they started doing this.

536
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,920
 No one knows why it was discovered.

537
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,660
 I personally think, and this is my theory, that some pervert wanted to eat virgin boy

538
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,540
 urine.

539
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,000
 We don't know the origins of so many things that we think we do.

540
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 The burrito.

541
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,360
 We don't know why we call a burrito a burrito.

542
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,580
 We talked about that on a recent episode.

543
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:50,580
 But if cryptids, these old timey cryptids, were drug users.

544
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,340
 So here's what I'm going with this.

545
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,220
 I always thought the stories of people with vampirism and lycanthropy, turning into a

546
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,940
 werewolf, was very, very closely connected to rabies.

547
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,020
 Because so many of them are connected.

548
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,820
 One, you're getting bit by a dog or you're getting bit by a bat or you're just getting

549
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,580
 out in the wild and you contract rabies, you go mad, you're frothing at the mouth, everyone

550
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,260
 thinks you're a lunatic and you won't cross rivers because people with rabies are deathly

551
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,020
 afraid of water.

552
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,180
 So if you saw someone with rabies in your village, you want to know what it was.

553
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,820
 Oh man, it got bit by that dog.

554
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,980
 That dog was acting crazy and then you start acting crazy and you would just be hitting

555
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
 them with a broom.

556
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,020
 You'd invent a broom real quick to hit them with it.

557
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
 You want to know what that was.

558
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,260
 But then I started thinking, what if there is a connection?

559
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,780
 Because when we have these stories of these cryptids, the question is always, when was

560
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,220
 the first one seen?

561
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:56,860
 Whether it's a water nymph or a headless mule or bigfoot, when was the first one seen?

562
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,740
 Like is it possible that way long ago, we're talking, some of these cryptids are actually

563
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,180
 more recent than you would imagine.

564
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
 The chupacabra?

565
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,140
 Chupacabra, we know where it came from.

566
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,580
 It was started, the first sighting was by a woman after she saw the movie Species.

567
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,260
 The chupacabra is so recent.

568
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,460
 It's after the movie Species.

569
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,660
 They've gone back and said, oh no, there were chupacabra sightings in the 1800s and 1600s.

570
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,420
 No, there were not.

571
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,980
 The chupacabra did not appear in the lore until after a single woman saw the movie Species

572
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,260
 and thought it was a documentary.

573
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:36,020
 There is a very, very well documented book called Hunting the Chupacabra or Searching

574
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
 for the Chupacabra.

575
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,380
 I'll put it in the show notes.

576
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,180
 The journal is, because it's such a new cryptid, they were able to track it back to the very

577
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,900
 first witness.

578
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,340
 That's why the chupacabra looks like the creature from Species.

579
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,540
 Chupacabra, whenever people bring that up, it instantly causes my eyeballs to roll back

580
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,100
 in the head because it's so easily dismissed.

581
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,060
 And that's what I'm talking about.

582
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:04,140
 What if more cryptids than we would like to think were a single lunatic tripping on some

583
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,460
 sort of drug in the middle of nowhere?

584
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,740
 What if it was people in the past ingesting drugs, acting super weird, and then a legend

585
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,180
 being built around them?

586
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
 Because this is my thing.

587
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,620
 I know this sounds really scattershot, but this is kind of what I'm getting at.

588
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:27,020
 You could have easily had some lunatic in a village back in the 1400s act in a fool.

589
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:33,820
 Like running off into the wilderness and a cryptid legend being started about that person.

590
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,940
 Saying there's something in the fur, and we know how these legends grow.

591
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,540
 First off, it'd be like "Don't go in the woods, we think that maniac's still out there."

592
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,180
 He drinks some wine, they don't know it's fermented that it had gone bad, but he drinks

593
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
 some wine and he got possessed.

594
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,020
 He ran out in the woods, don't go out there.

595
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,380
 And then the next generation, even though this guy would have been long dead by now,

596
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,380
 probably fell into a chasm, the next generation was like "Don't go out in the woods, there's

597
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,460
 a taper picnic, but if you don't go out to the other side of the woods either."

598
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,140
 Because there's the thing out there, he stands in the darkness with glowing red eyes, and

599
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,700
 then the story keeps growing and growing and growing.

600
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,540
 Because imagine this today.

601
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,740
 Let's go 500 years in the future.

602
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,420
 Where origins of things are lost.

603
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,620
 We're not like a caveman society where super advanced, but we still over time just lose

604
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
 sight of things.

605
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:26,860
 If you talk to someone 500 years from now about a meth addict today, they would sound

606
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,140
 like a cryptid.

607
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,180
 You wouldn't believe that people would be like "That's old superstition."

608
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,940
 You're like "No, because imagine 500 years in the future we've moved past the need for

609
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,100
 drug abuse, we've moved past the need to put these chemicals in our body to feel good."

610
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,620
 If you sat down and you talked to someone, listen.

611
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,660
 In my neighborhood there used to be a guy who would, there used to be a guy who didn't

612
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,420
 sleep, he never slept, he peeled his own skin off, he would pick little pieces of his skin

613
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:04,140
 off, his teeth would fall out of his mouth, he drank more Mountain Dew than he thought

614
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:12,620
 was humanly possible, and he would see the shadow realm, he could see past reality.

615
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,660
 Even in the future it would be like you're totally making that up.

616
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,380
 You're 100% making that up.

617
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,580
 There's another guy in my neighborhood you say because it's a really bad neighborhood,

618
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,260
 who did PCP?

619
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,180
 And I would watch him fight 10 cops off at once.

620
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,660
 It's a very, very exciting neighborhood.

621
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,940
 He was just getting tased and hit with batons, he shook it all off.

622
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,380
 If you talked to people about drug addicts and they had no concept for the drugs that

623
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,500
 we do today, they would seem like they were cryptids.

624
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,620
 To some they may seem like gods.

625
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,580
 Yeah, it used to be, I knew this guy, this other guy on my block, who smoked weed and

626
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,620
 he could communicate with the oneness, he would get so stoned that time would slow down

627
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,540
 and he could see the syllables in his own brain form.

628
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,700
 As the sentences were being said.

629
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:13,500
 It is a superhuman feat to be able to manipulate time like that.

630
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,400
 So why couldn't it be that in the past as well?

631
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,460
 Not saying that they had some meth factory in our Thurian times, but these people eating

632
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,780
 these berry bushes, eating these plants that are either drug like in nature or they're

633
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,380
 processed to become an old timey drug.

634
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
 Did you know?

635
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,020
 This just goes to show, because people are like Jason we don't lose history that much.

636
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,420
 Did you know there used to be three shakers on a table?

637
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:48,260
 Up until like the late 1700s, early 1800s, you had salt, pepper and something else.

638
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,760
 And we don't know what that something else was.

639
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,620
 When we look in history, we can see there were three shakers on tables, pre-1700s.

640
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,100
 Salt, pepper and something else.

641
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,220
 We have no idea what it was.

642
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
 None.

643
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,100
 We've narrowed it down to like 5 or 6 different spices.

644
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,500
 But they can't get it any closer than that.

645
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 Because the question goes, out of all the spices available in the medieval world, why

646
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,780
 salt and pepper?

647
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
 Salt obvious.

648
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,700
 Salt's obvious because it's to preserve food.

649
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,900
 But why pepper?

650
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,620
 When you have all this other stuff, you have paprika, you have cayenne, you have a bunch

651
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,620
 of other stuff.

652
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,420
 I'm not a real spice guy, I'm more of a spice girl.

653
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,980
 But why pepper and what was the third one?

654
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,860
 That just happened 200 years ago.

655
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,020
 It was such a domestic, it was such a common thing.

656
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,780
 It would be sitting on your table.

657
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,900
 If you were in the 1700s, you would go, where's the third shaker?

658
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,780
 And you would know exactly what it was.

659
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,860
 But today, historians have no idea what it is at all.

660
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,540
 So that's how quickly that something incredibly common can be lost.

661
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,340
 And it would be fascinating to learn that all these cryptids, we spend so much time

662
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,540
 researching and having fun with and trying to investigate and see if they're true.

663
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:11,020
 If 99.9% of them are 100% urban legends that have grown over time.

664
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,800
 Or based on real people, a single event of a lunatic doing something and then a legend

665
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,780
 being brought out about them.

666
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:26,020
 Or not a single lunatic, but a group of people who are engaging in some sort of drug use.

667
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,060
 The world of the paranormal is fascinating, but not because it's paranormal.

668
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,140
 Because it's so close to normal.

669
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,900
 If the answer was always just, it's magic, it's interdimensional, you can't comprehend

670
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,100
 it, that's okay.

671
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,780
 But I think if we can trace at least some of these things back to a rational answer,

672
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:49,060
 that we can sit back and go, whoa, that's it.

673
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,500
 We figured it out.

674
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,700
 That makes the chase even more exciting.

675
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,260
 That makes the search have an ending.

676
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,140
 Whether or not we find the answer isn't always the important part, but it's nice to find

677
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
 some of them.

678
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:11,020
 Even if the answer is mundane as the story of Dracula was just a dude who was ripping

679
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:19,060
 on a bong and got a little two stone and decided to impale 10,000 people.

680
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,300
 Dead rabbit radio and Gmail duck.

681
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,180
 There's two episodes left.

682
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,140
 I've lost five pounds when dead rabbit radio.

683
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,940
 I like that.

684
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,140
 I always imagine sometimes at the end of these episodes, there's like two people listening.

685
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,900
 They're like, I'll try it tomorrow.

686
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,380

687
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,980

688

 I like this one.

689
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,700
 I can just imagine that one person left there like I like it too.

690
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,940
