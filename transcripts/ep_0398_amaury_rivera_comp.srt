1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
 A pair of bizarre incidents in the United Kingdom may point to something sinister going on.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,400
 And then we travel to Puerto Rico to meet a man named Amore Rivera, who not only claims

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,920
 he was abducted by aliens, but has photographic proof of the military coming to save him,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,720
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:34,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,840
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,920
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to jump right into it.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,040
 First off, this time I'm going to give the keys to someone who's supported the Patreon

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
 for a long time.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,760
 A lot of times I give the keys to a new listener, but let's give a shout out to the people

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,480
 who have continued to support the Patreon all this time.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,600
 So, Kentilians, here you go, you're our first classic Patreon listener, person, supporter,

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 I guess this is the term.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,120
 I'm throwing you those carbonic hopter keys, flying through the air, you grab them, ding.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,040
 Kentilians, you are going to take us up, up and away to Bolton.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,080
 Now we've talked about this a lot.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,040
 I don't really know how stuff works in pretty much anywhere outside the United States, to

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 be honest I barely know how stuff works here.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,800
 But so in England or the United Kingdom is the technical term, there is a play, there's

21
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,560
 like the county or the Shire of Bolton, which is where we're going, and then there's also

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,120
 next to it a place called Manchester, which we'll get there in a second.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,000
 Anyways, we're going to, first off we're going to go to Little Holton.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,160
 Kentilians is flying the helicopter, he's like "Dude just say where we're going, we're

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,400
 hovering, we're swaying back and forth."

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,480
 He's like "I know how this works Jason, you can at least know some basic geography, whatever."

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,560
 So land the helicopter in Little Holton.

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,840
 Now both of these stories I completely stumbled across.

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,160
 Nobody's made this connection yet.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 At all.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,880
 Super weird.

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,480
 On February 22nd the Bolton News has an article, just a little weird article in their newspaper,

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
 no follow up yet.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,760
 It doesn't say the date that it happened, but the article was published on February 22nd.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:30,080
 In Little Holton, in Manchester, police officers get a call, 999 what's your emergency?

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,440
 There's a car abandoned in the middle of the road.

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,080
 Okay, let's go out there.

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,960
 Woo woo woo, cops pull up and they see a car, broad daylight, like mid morning.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,520
 Woo woo woo woo, car is sitting there in the middle of the road.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,720
 Cops get out, they're like "What's all this then?"

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,160
 Walk up to it, completely locked.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,720
 All doors locked, windows rolled up, looking in there, there's no one around.

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 This, what?

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,400
 Shhh, hey British cops, shhh, yeah we got a report of another car dropped off in the

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 middle of the road away.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
 What?

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
 Woo woo woo, go out.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,880
 Other part of Little Holton, there's a car just sitting in the middle of the road, completely

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
 abandoned.

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
 What's all this then?

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,960
 Shhh, hey British police, we have a report.

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,440
 They got within one day, four reports of four abandoned cars.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,560
 Two of them were blocking the road, right?

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,800
 Two of them were half on the road, half on the sidewalk.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,000
 There was no damage to any of the cars.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,360
 All the cars were locked up, there was nobody around.

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,720
 Done, done, and you're like Jason, that's true.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,960
 Okay, that's the first part of it, right?

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,160
 Now you think these cars obviously have license plates, the police can get in, I mean I could

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 break into a car like that, but anyways, so you figure, well the police should just look

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,840
 up the, they must know who those cars belong to by now.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,600
 That article was published on the 22nd, the story probably took place on the 21st and

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,120
 the 20th, it's been six days since, but there's no follow up to it, it's such a small story,

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 right?

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,720
 Four cars, I don't think it's a small story.

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,760
 I think it's quite creepy, but four cars found completely abandoned in the city of Little

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 Holton.

68
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,800
 So, that happened on February 22nd.

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,440
 On February 23rd, there's another article in the Bolton News.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,400
 Now we're going to Rivington in Bolton, so we're leaving Little Holton, we're going to

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,400
 Rivington, it's 10 miles away, so what is that, like 30 centimeters?

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,360
 It's a 27 minute drive from Little Holton to Rivington.

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,280
 And there's a woman, a young woman named Jane Tolan, she's the manager, sorry, general

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,400
 manager, I'm sure there's a distinction, of the village green tea room.

75
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,480
 And now she's walking around Rivington, my car, I got locked out of my car in Little

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,120
 Holton, so now I had to walk all the way here, I had to walk 30 centimeters, now I'm in Rivington,

77
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,400
 so she lives in Rivington, she works in Rivington, she's walking around Rivington, and she stops

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,360
 dead in her tracks.

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:15,480
 She's staring at this sign, what, what, no, the sign is for the village green tea room.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,800
 It's a sign that was put up three years ago, cost a thousand pounds, and it's basically

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,880
 village tea room, and then the direction that you want to go in to go to the tea room.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,840
 The advertisement, it's an advertisement, right?

83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,520
 With a helpful arrow pointing which way to find the tea room.

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,960
 Now Jane Tolan knows this sign by heart, she's seen it a hundred times, gold lettering, beautiful

85
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,240
 gold lettering, it's a green sign with the arrow pointing down the main road.

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,880
 So when people are driving down the road, they see, oh, I want tea, I haven't had tea in five

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,240
 minutes because this is Britain, let's go to the village green tea room, so they follow

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,760
 the arrow.

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,880
 But now she's standing there looking at this sign, it's white lettering, it's no longer

90
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,320
 gold, and the arrow no longer points down the road.

91
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:17,200
 The arrow points towards the local church chapel where there's a footpath that takes

92
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,080
 you to the tea room.

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,680
 And so Jane goes to the church, she goes, did you guys change my sign?

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,400
 And they go, no, we thought you changed it.

95
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,720
 She's like, this has to have been done recent, and they go, we remember a sense a little

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,360
 bit before Christmas, the sign was white, but we assumed that you had changed it.

97
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,160
 Because see, for people taking the footpath, it's much safer for them to walk through the

98
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,040
 church to get to the tea room.

99
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,480
 Before the arrow was kind of pointing them so they'd have to cross a relatively busy

100
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,880
 street.

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,640
 And she goes, the sign wasn't intended necessarily for walkers.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,400
 Walkers could follow the sign, but it was intended for the drivers.

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
 Who changed the sign?

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,040
 Parish people go, I mean, it's on our property, but we didn't do it.

105
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,360
 Basically this story gets reported in the media and Jane's like, this doesn't make

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,400
 any sense, I didn't change the sign, I'm in charge of the tea room, church didn't change

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
 the sign.

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,160
 And more importantly, who paid for it?

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
 This is not the sign that's been up for three years.

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
 And so somebody changed the sign.

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,000
 The church goes, yeah, the sign used to be gold lettering.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
 Jane goes, the sign used to be gold lettering.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,080
 The arrow pointed it in a different direction.

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
 Who changed the sign?

115
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,200
 And she goes, whoever changed the sign, this was professionally done.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,000
 This wasn't like just hand painted on Tom Sawyer.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,760
 This was a professionally done sign.

118
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 Who paid for it?

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 It was $2,000.

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 We know that.

121
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 Who paid for it?

122
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,640
 Why haven't I ever gotten a bill?

123
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
 Who changed it?

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
 What's going on?

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,880
 Both of these stories, that story is very reminiscent of a Mandela effect type thing.

126
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:12,240
 But it's almost like now you can dig up physical proof and receipts and everyone who's involved

127
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
 in the story agrees this is not the original sign.

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,100
 They just thought the other person had changed it.

129
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,640
 So it's not like the church is going, oh no, no, no, it was always white lettering.

130
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,360
 They both agree it used to be gold lettering pointing in a different direction.

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
 So somebody changed it.

132
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,760
 But the only two parties that really matter both thought the other one didn't, they didn't

133
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
 do it themselves.

134
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,040
 So unless a third party shelled out a thousand bucks to do free advertising for these people,

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,400
 which is possible, which is more likely than what I'm about to say.

136
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,380
 But that's very Mandela effect-ish like.

137
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:55,360
 With both of these weird events happening so close to each other geographically and time-wise,

138
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,880
 is it possible we're looking at some sort of paranormal vortex in the area of Bolton?

139
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,160
 I mean, technically it's unlikely.

140
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,320
 But I find it odd and what's more interesting to me is I always love the idea that the world

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,300
 is so big and populated that weird stuff like this can happen all the time and we just don't

142
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,020
 observe it.

143
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,940
 We spend so much time looking for Bigfoot or looking for UFOs that things like this

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,700
 kind of go unnoticed.

145
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,060
 Now at this point, I would assume they found the owner of the cars.

146
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,940
 But what if they haven't?

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,780
 What if they just found four abandoned cars and they can't track the registration, they

148
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,660
 can't track who the drivers are?

149
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,680
 And then 10 miles away you have a sign being replaced.

150
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,120
 A sign being replaced in such minute ways that you would think it almost was the decision

151
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,560
 that the tea room made in an alternate reality.

152
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,200
 Oh no, no, let's have it be a footpath sign.

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
 Oh yeah, yeah.

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,560
 So is there a reality where very close to ours where there has appeared a gold sign pointing

155
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,580
 towards the road and people are like "what?"

156
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,540
 Staring at that sign as well.

157
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,300
 And are there just four people going "where's my car man?

158
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,900
 I'm just driving my car and then I tumbled out of it."

159
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,100
 Let's keep an eye on Bolton for a while, let's keep an eye on this area, I'll see if I can

160
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,440
 find anything else but I think something's going on over there.

161
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,500
 We may be seeing the birth of a reverse Bermuda Triangle where stuff isn't lost but it's found,

162
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,840
 it's just found doing the wrong things.

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,640
 Worlds a weird place guys, the world is a bizarre place.

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
 Speaking of bizarre, I want to do a Dead Rabbit Radio Recommends.

165
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
 Try to get more of these out.

166
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,960
 This one's actually a real subtle one.

167
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,760
 Not that I'm going to subtly, I'm going to be like "pspspsps" recommending it.

168
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:05,880
 There is a movie called The History of Time Travel and it's a documentary about time travel.

169
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,380
 As in time travel has already been invented and it's a documentary talking about how time

170
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,180
 travel has impacted society.

171
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 So it's a mockumentary about a world where time travel was invented during the 1960s.

172
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,300
 It's a really interesting movie.

173
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,440
 A lot of times when I'm watching movies I'll be playing Minecraft because I don't have

174
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,920
 time to do just one thing.

175
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,780
 So I'll have the movie going on, I'll be playing Minecraft, I know a bunch of these cinephiles

176
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,500
 are pulling your hair out right now.

177
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,020
 I've got to get my diamonds homey.

178
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,000
 I've got to get my diamonds.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,560
 I'm playing Minecraft watching movies.

180
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,000
 Guess how I listen to podcasts as well.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
 That's how a lot of you guys listen to podcasts.

182
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,800
 I get a lot of emails saying "listen while I'm playing video games" which is cool.

183
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,280
 Ruiner2077 on Twitter listens to Dead Rabbit Radio while he's pushing those weights.

184
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 Yeah!

185
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,080
 If you can do that too, you don't have to just play video games.

186
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,880
 But anyways, I play Minecraft and it's a super subtle movie.

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
 It's really really interesting.

188
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,360
 That's all I'm going to say about it.

189
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 Check it out.

190
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 It's called "History of Time Travel."

191
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,820
 It's a very kind of cool little movie going on.

192
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,980
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

193
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
 Our last story.

194
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,460
 We are going to go to Puerto Rico.

195
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,820
 We're going down there now.

196
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,820
 We're going to meet a guy named Amore Rivera.

197
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,180
 This segment might run kind of long because it's kind of detailed.

198
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,980
 I don't want to leave a lot of stuff out.

199
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
 Amore Rivera.

200
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,140
 Hey, what's up man?

201
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,880
 So Amore Rivera was a young dude.

202
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:38,520
 He was driving home from a concert, a band called El Gran Combo, which suppose, according

203
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,880
 to him, because he's written up this long document explaining everything that happened.

204
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,960
 This is an old story, but it's fairly obscure.

205
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,560
 You can find the whole manifesto for a lack of a better term that he's written up.

206
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,720
 But he's on his way home from an El Gran Combo concert.

207
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,740
 Now his aunt had given him a camera so he could take photos of all the band members.

208
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,240
 There's 13, by the way.

209
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,740
 It's a lot of photos.

210
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,740
 And this story takes place May 10th, 1988.

211
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,860
 You're like, "That's not a lot of photos I can fit.

212
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,580
 That many photos on my phone.

213
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
 I can...

214
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,740
 A thousand times that photos."

215
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,100
 Well, there's a regular camera back then.

216
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,980
 You had like what, 24 pictures?

217
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,100
 You had to take photos of the band.

218
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,880
 He also gave him an album that she instructed him to get every signature from every band

219
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
 member.

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,600
 So 13 signatures, a bunch of photographs.

221
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,280
 This guy has a bit of social anxiety.

222
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,560
 He gets to the concert.

223
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
 There's a ton of people there.

224
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,960
 He says most people he's ever seen at that venue.

225
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,680
 So he throws the album behind the bar and he plans on telling his aunt that, "Oh, I got

226
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
 all the signatures.

227
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
 Oh, it was totally awesome.

228
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,920
 They were like writing new song lyrics.

229
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 Oh dude, you totally would have loved it."

230
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,900
 But someone stole it.

231
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,700
 So he kind of admits to even lying that he's a bit of a liar at the beginning of his story

232
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,260
 here, but that was his plan.

233
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,700
 But anyways, maybe for karma for that, it's 4.30 a.m.

234
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
 He's leaving.

235
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
 That's a good concert, dude.

236
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,020
 When you're driving home at 4.30 a.m., signatures are not.

237
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,580
 You've had a good time.

238
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,660
 Driving home from this concert at 4.30 a.m.

239
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,860
 He has all these songs stuck in his head, but luckily they all sound the same.

240
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,400
 So what are you going to do?

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,560
 He's driving home and he sees a dense fog.

242
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
 Invelop the car.

243
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,760
 He's like, "Oh, this isn't good."

244
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,920
 Actually, he's not that smart.

245
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,320
 Mori, I apologize for that comment, but if you're listening to this episode, I hope

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
 that we've made some leaps and bounds in logic.

247
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,800
 He's driving down the road.

248
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,320
 He's enveloped in fog.

249
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,960
 Now, the fog starts to break and he notices he's going like maybe 35 miles an hour, 40

250
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,720
 miles an hour, because he's in fog.

251
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
 He's driving down the road.

252
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,020
 He hears, "No, it's not the little drummer, boy."

253
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,260
 He hears someone running right outside his car.

254
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,940
 Now, he turns and he looks and he first thinks, "It's a little kid, because three feet tall.

255
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,540
 It's a little kid wearing a Halloween costume because it has a big old head, right?

256
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
 Big old eyes."

257
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,780
 This thing's running alongside of him.

258
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
 He thinks it's a kid.

259
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,700
 Now, choose your adventure time.

260
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
 You're driving down the road.

261
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
 Not really.

262
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,660
 We're not going to do a full interactive episode, but you're driving down the road.

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,280
 You're being chased or you're being paralleled by this kid.

264
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,920
 This alien, this gray alien's running alongside your car, which I've never known them to

265
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
 run that fast.

266
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
 Maybe he was actually just hanging onto the side of the car.

267
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,880
 He had a sound effect machine of like feet hitting.

268
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,120
 Now, you have two choices.

269
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
 You can hit the gas.

270
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,760
 You can swerve to your left and try to run the kid over.

271
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,280
 I'm sorry, run the alien over.

272
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,600
 You don't want to run kids over.

273
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,500
 I'll show you kids.

274
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,380
 Or you can stop the car, right?

275
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,740
 Well, obviously you don't want to stop the car because the alien's going to get you.

276
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,300
 And you don't know, maybe you could swerve to the left with alien.

277
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 I don't know.

278
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,780
 Don't do that either because it might actually be a kid in a Halloween costume.

279
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,700
 You chose right if you chose A. Hit the gas pedal.

280
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,900
 So Amore hits the gas pedal, but he forgets, this is 100% true, he forgets which pedal

281
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,760
 is the gas pedal because he's so scared he hits the brake.

282
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,520
 His car comes to a complete stop in the middle of the night with an alien standing right

283
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,360
 next to his car.

284
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,560
 That's just the beginning of this dude's most ridiculous decisions.

285
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,120
 So now his car is at a complete stop.

286
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 There's an alien standing outside his car.

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,880
 He looks down the street and he sees a bright light.

288
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,720
 And this other alien in really, really tight clothes, which seems to be super common because

289
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,780
 we've had a lot of those lately.

290
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,700
 Alien in super tight clothes is walking towards his car and then he looks out the passenger

291
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,580
 side of this car.

292
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,100
 There's an alien walking that way too.

293
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,820
 This dude's totally boned, right?

294
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,620
 And now the aliens, we know aliens have all these technology.

295
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,780
 They can use telepathy to like freeze your body.

296
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,260
 They have ray guns.

297
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,820
 They have like beam weapons that can paralyze you.

298
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,660
 We've seen this throughout stories we've done.

299
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,900
 Amore is so scared he blacks out.

300
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,960
 So they don't even have to use it.

301
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,360
 You can imagine those aliens being like, "Oh, my first training mission.

302
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,760
 Can't wait to use my telepath."

303
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,040
 Oh, he's asleep already.

304
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
 He's all, "Ugh."

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,560
 Oh man, I just invented this new ray gun.

306
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
 They're like, "I know Barry.

307
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 I know."

308
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,160
 Sometimes people, the guy did stop his car, right?

309
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,400
 We're not dealing with a dude with his full deck.

310
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
 Sometimes people just fall asleep.

311
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280
 So he wakes up.

312
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,200
 Now we get a combination of creepy plus him being Amoron.

313
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 Again, Amore.

314
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 So I'm sorry.

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,340
 I hope that things are much better for you now.

316
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,780
 Amore wakes up.

317
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,260
 I thought this was a creepy visual.

318
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,780
 It actually plays in the first story.

319
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,100
 He wakes up.

320
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
 He wakes up.

321
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,340
 He's still in his car.

322
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,540
 But his car is in some sort of what he describes as an underground parking garage type space.

323
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,660
 I don't know if it was actually made of concrete, but that's what it reminded of him.

324
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,860
 And he saw other empty cars in the same area.

325
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,180
 That's creepy, right?

326
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,920
 I find parking garages by themselves are creepy because I've seen so many horror movies where

327
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,480
 young women are being chased through them.

328
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,160
 I'm not a young woman, but I can empathize with people.

329
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,720
 I don't think every victim in a horror movie doesn't have to be me.

330
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 I'm like, "What?

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 That's lame."

332
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,920
 I don't have to watch a movie where it's five Jason's at a sorority house.

333
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
 He wakes up.

334
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
 He's in the parking garage.

335
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,080
 And he sees a bunch of empty cars.

336
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
 Now at this point, he's like, "I just totally suck.

337
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I don't know where I'm at.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,360
 I'm super scared still.

339
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,500
 If I could pass out, I would."

340
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,980
 At that moment, an alien pops up from along the side of his car.

341
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,620
 He was just chilling there the whole time, I guess.

342
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,940
 And then reaches into the car.

343
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,780
 I'm assuming the windows rolled down at this point.

344
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,780
 Maybe the aliens rolled it down and then they're like, "He's sleeping."

345
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
 They rolled it down.

346
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
 They abduct him.

347
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,460
 He wakes up and the windows open.

348
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,020
 He's like, "Ah, the alien touches his forehead."

349
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,300
 He passes back out.

350
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
 He's a berry.

351
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,540
 He's like, "Yeah, finally got to use my powers."

352
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,560
 He wakes back up.

353
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
 Now he's out of his car.

354
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,640
 He's in this rectangular room filled with nothing.

355
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,000
 He calls it the Great Infinite Space.

356
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,520
 I would think I was dead at that point.

357
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,040
 If I woke up in a Great Infinite void, I'd be like, "Oh, okay, I'm dead.

358
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 This is it."

359
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
 But he's looking around.

360
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,760
 He said everything was one color.

361
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,480
 He said everything had one even lighting.

362
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,320
 And it just seemed to go on and on forever.

363
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 Here's a quote.

364
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,380
 "If a person stood in the middle of that place alone, without any point of reference,

365
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,980
 he would think he was standing in a great empty space.

366
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,100
 One could not see doors or windows of any kind."

367
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,660
 He's standing there.

368
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,860
 He's looking through the infinite void.

369
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,620
 He's taking this all in.

370
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,260
 He's already told us that this is a great infinite space.

371
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,100
 If you looked on in one direction, you'd be completely alone.

372
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,040
 He turns his head slightly to the left.

373
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,440
 There's 20 Puerto Ricans sitting on a big giant couch.

374
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,440
 Dude, why did you tell us that you were standing in a great infinite void if there's 20 other

375
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
 dudes next to you?

376
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,480
 So apparently, then he goes on for a paragraph to tell us about a couch.

377
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,280
 He goes really into detail about this couch, right?

378
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,520
 This couch is completely blended into the wall.

379
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,160
 And the way the lighting hit it made it seem like there was no couch there at all.

380
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,620
 He could not perceive the couch.

381
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,620
 Fair enough.

382
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:34,240
 You could perceive the 20 other Puerto Ricans sitting on the couch, though, right?

383
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,880
 Like I get it, you can't see the armrest, because there's 20 people sitting on it.

384
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,420
 But don't go on about your great infinite space when there's just a bunch of dudes chilling

385
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
 there.

386
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,580
 Now, to be fair, in his defense, they weren't making any noise.

387
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,220
 Which I actually don't believe is true, because I've never met 20 people of any group to not

388
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
 make any noise.

389
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,560
 And that's probably if you're in sheer terror of being abducted by aliens.

390
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,760
 Can you imagine the first person who showed up there?

391
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
 He's like, "Ahh, I'm in the void!"

392
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
 It would have taken him a year to find that couch, because apparently it is invisible.

393
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
 Then the second person shows up and they're like, "Why are you bumbling around?"

394
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,520
 He's like, "I don't know where to sit!"

395
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 They kind of feel around.

396
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
 "I feel an armrest, what?

397
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,040
 Oh, look it, here's a cushion here."

398
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,800
 And then they sit down and then the third person, "Oh no, I'm lost in the void.

399
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,520
 Let me turn my neck slightly to the left."

400
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,800
 "Hey, what's up guys?

401
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 Hey!"

402
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,000
 And then they probably had a big party, and it was probably when a morrie showed

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
 up, everyone's all, "Oh, great, this nerd."

404
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,740
 We heard that, he doesn't even, he can't even get an album signed!

405
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
 Oh, great!

406
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,740
 So he gets abducted, now he's hanging out, now he's number 21 on this couch, this infinite

407
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
 couch.

408
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,300
 So they're all sitting in this great empty space, it also has a giant couch on it.

409
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,620
 So they're standing there, and now these two aliens, these two gray aliens walk into the

410
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,780
 room and they're just staring at these dudes.

411
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,820
 So a morrie and his buddies, well they're not his buddies, they really don't like them,

412
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
 they don't want to talk to them.

413
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,320
 Everyone is having a great conversation until he showed up.

414
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
 The aliens are just staring at him, and at that point, some time passes, the aliens just

415
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,560
 kind of staring him down.

416
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,880
 So this guy walks in, this tall white guy, which you think Nordic, right?

417
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,520
 But he has black hair, so maybe he's going through his emo phase, that's like swept over

418
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 one eye.

419
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,960
 It's like the universe doesn't, he's cutting himself with fusion torches, ah!

420
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
 It burns so good.

421
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,120
 Anyways he walks in, the two gray aliens are standing there in this Nordic, which if you

422
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,820
 don't know what a Nordic is, it's basically a tall human looking alien.

423
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
 They look like people from Norway.

424
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,460
 So he walks in, he can tell everyone's a little afraid, right?

425
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,260
 And he's like, "Hmm, you guys are afraid of these aliens, let me show you that there's

426
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
 nothing to be afraid of."

427
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,900
 And then he picks up one of the gray aliens, and the gray, this is so bizarre, the gray

428
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,180
 alien wraps his legs around the man's waist, and then the man begins manipulating the gray

429
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,580
 aliens, like he puts his hand under his chin and begins moving it back and forth.

430
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,520
 He's like, "See, they're harmless."

431
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,040
 That was actual quote, "See, they're harmless, like look at, I can hold this like a child."

432
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,600
 Now I would, yes, thank you, thank you Nordic man, I was terrified of the two gray aliens

433
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
 staring at me.

434
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,960
 I'm also terrified of one, I'm trapped in an infinite void, I'm on a couch floating

435
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,080
 through an infinite void, that's scary.

436
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,480
 Two, I still don't know where I'm at, it doesn't matter if you can move a gray alien's head.

437
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,420
 Now, this dude is now walking around with this gray alien wrapped around him.

438
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,780
 I assume the rest of the story, but this Nordic guy says this.

439
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,940
 Well, this is what we know, because see Amore says, "I can't tell you everything we talked

440
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
 about."

441
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,180
 I can't tell you everything we talked about, some of it has to remain private, but there

442
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,140
 was a catastrophe that was going to come to earth, and we were chosen to help save the

443
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,980
 country of Puerto Rico from this disaster.

444
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,120
 Now come on Amore, you can't really hide that type of info.

445
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,320
 No, no, no, no, no, I can't tell you what it is, I can give you some tidbits, I can give

446
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 you some clues.

447
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:04,520
 One, he says they were showing on this monitor a massive tidal wave hitting San Juan.

448
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,120
 They saw an earthquake splitting the island in half causing mass death.

449
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,320
 So whether that is some sort of just massive natural disaster, you're like Jason, that's

450
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,440
 kind of what it sounds like.

451
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,460
 But could have been, I wonder if asteroid strike is considered a natural disaster, because

452
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,700
 you know, rocks are natural.

453
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,900
 But you know, whether it's some sort of asteroid strike, maybe it's just some sort of basic

454
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,020
 massive earthquake, but something huge was coming.

455
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,300
 And it was their job to help prepare Puerto Rico for it.

456
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,060
 Now they were each given a particular task by the aliens to do.

457
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,380
 Now he doesn't say even what his task was, whatever job they gave him had something to

458
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,640
 do with plants and animals.

459
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,000
 Now that's super vague, right?

460
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,280
 He won't tell us what it was.

461
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,000
 He does tell us what another guy's mission was.

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,440
 We have this, let me go back to this passage he wrote here.

463
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,800
 The strange man took each of the people there in turn and told them what they would be doing

464
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,480
 at the time of the cataclysmic event.

465
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,480
 To a young man in his high teens sitting there in his undershorts and sandals, obviously

466
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,560
 taken while relieving himself in his backyard.

467
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,400
 So this dude was pissing in his backyard at 430 in the morning.

468
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,640
 "Hey buddies, I'll be right in.

469
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 I gotta take a leak."

470
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

471
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:50,280
 And then he is told by an alien that "He would have to provide drinking water for

472
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,360
 50,000 people."

473
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,200
 Now you could show an alien and show me "Hey, Oregon's gonna get hit by this earthquake

474
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,360
 and you're gonna have to do coordination stuff or you're gonna have to cut wood or you're

475
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,920
 gonna have to just leave.

476
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
 Just leave Jason.

477
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
 We'll let other people take care of it.

478
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,140
 Trained emergency personnel.

479
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,000
 There's a lot of different things that I could probably do.

480
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,480
 I could definitely leave.

481
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,840
 Amore doesn't reveal what his task was.

482
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,880
 Could you imagine being 17 years old, pissing in the backyard, getting it up to my aliens,

483
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,360
 and then being told that pretty soon you would have to provide drinking water for 50,000

484
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 people.

485
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,000
 Like how would you even calculate that?

486
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,760
 You're like, "Uh, 50,000 people in one day?

487
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,560
 Like how would that blow my mind?"

488
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,840
 I'd be like, "Dude, I just come on man.

489
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,720
 Can I get that?

490
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,880
 Can I get Amore's job?"

491
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
 And they're like, "No, no.

492
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,040
 Amore, he's not all there.

493
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,640
 We accidentally abducted him.

494
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,120
 It was an accident we were trying to get some physicists.

495
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,200
 We don't know what's gonna happen with the nuclear reactors, but we're stuck with this

496
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 guy.

497
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,120
 So we just told him to take care of the bunnies."

498
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
 And then he'll do that.

499
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,920
 He has to feed five bunnies.

500
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
 "Come on, man.

501
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
 Can I get that job?"

502
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,000
 "No.

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,440
 You will learn to desalinate and purify water for 50,000 people a day.

504
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
 A day?

505
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
 A day.

506
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
 And I'm turning now."

507
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,200
 Now, Amore says this interest, and he goes, "Because the age range of people on the couch

508
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,080
 were high teens.

509
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,680
 There are some older people."

510
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,680
 And so he figured that this event was gonna happen within the next 20 years.

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,960
 Because they were told this event was gonna happen in their lifetime.

512
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
 So he figured it actually should happen by now.

513
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,600
 But so you're like, "Jay, why are you wasting my time with a story about a disaster that

514
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 hasn't happened?"

515
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
 "Whoa, hold on.

516
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 Hold on.

517
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,400
 You watch your mouth or I'm gonna make you get water for 50,000 people."

518
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,600
 He goes, "I figured it would happen within our lifetime.

519
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
 And considering how old the oldest person was, I'm thinking it should happen within 20

520
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
 years.

521
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,080
 So the oldest person probably in their 60s."

522
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,240
 So next thing Amore knows, he wakes up in his car.

523
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,560
 What a dream I had, but didn't have because it was totally real.

524
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,520
 And he's in a known location.

525
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,240
 He's not where he thought he was.

526
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,440
 Now you may think he got roofied.

527
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,680
 He got roofied at the salsa party and he tried driving home and he passed out somewhere.

528
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 That's possible.

529
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
 That's possible.

530
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,840
 There's a kid with a Halloween costume caught underneath his wheels.

531
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,280
 But he wakes up in an unknown location.

532
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,960
 He has no idea where he's at, but he's back in his car and he says that he just began

533
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
 crying.

534
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,960
 He began sobbing.

535
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,800
 He says he cried like he would cry when his mother would die.

536
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,480
 She hasn't died.

537
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
 But if she dies eventually, this is how hard I'm gonna cry.

538
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,040
 That's what he says in his statement.

539
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 He's crying.

540
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,800
 And then that's not him extra crying.

541
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,320
 He looks up.

542
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,240
 He sees fighter jets in the air.

543
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,040
 And then he sees a silvery disc.

544
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,840
 Fighter jets are circling this UFO and he goes, "Wait a second.

545
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,880
 I have a camera in my car."

546
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,120
 So the camera that his aunt gave him to take pictures of this salsa band, he jumps out

547
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,400
 of his car with his camera and he points it to the sky and he takes a photo.

548
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,720
 Every time he takes a photo he hears a beep, beep, beep.

549
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,600
 Pressing that button he hears a little electronic beep.

550
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,400
 But the thing is this camera has no beep built into it.

551
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
 It just should go the click.

552
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,840
 Click, but he's hearing a beep every time he takes the photo.

553
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 Eventually there's a bright light.

554
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,520
 UFO is gone.

555
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,160
 The jets fly away.

556
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,800
 Now these photos are available online.

557
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,840
 I recommend you take a look at these photos.

558
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,040
 Cause I look at the photos and I have a hard time determining whether or not they're fake.

559
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,360
 Which probably, they look pretty fake to me, honestly.

560
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,040
 But here's the thing.

561
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,080
 I don't know what a fighter jet, the reason why they look fake to me is that the jet is

562
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,320
 completely in shadow.

563
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,840
 But the UFO you can see some, I don't know, I don't know anything really about photos.

564
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,800
 But you can see UFOs like lit better.

565
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:23,640
 However, who's to say that a UFO would follow any sort of, well I guess someone who knows

566
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,240
 who's a therapy.

567
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,600
 But you know like maybe light hits UFOs differently cause they're from some, okay so anyways the

568
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,000
 photos are probably fake.

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,560
 But they're interesting nonetheless.

570
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,480
 I wish I could use them as the artwork for this episode.

571
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,880
 But I've had stuff taken down because of copyright things using photos like that.

572
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,280
 So I gotta be careful about that.

573
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,160
 But I recommend checking them out online.

574
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,200
 But basically it's an intriguing photo to say the least.

575
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,000
 Now the way that this story all comes about is that Amore drives home and he just goes

576
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 to sleep.

577
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Like what would you do after this?

578
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,720
 He's like I gotta find five bunnies and feed him.

579
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,240
 But first, and he goes home and he sleeps.

580
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,320
 Now he tosses the camera to his aunt.

581
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,560
 And I'm sure his aunt was like hey where's the album?

582
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,520
 And he's like dude I'm not even gonna talk to you about this stupid album right now.

583
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
 I gotta go to sleep.

584
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,000
 We'll talk, I'll lie to you about the album later.

585
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Cause he did.

586
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,560
 He said in the confession the first time his aunt will ever figure out what really happened

587
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,560
 to that album was when she reads this confession.

588
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,400
 That he was writing, not really confession but this story.

589
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,120
 He was writing out for UFO researcher.

590
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,080
 I don't think she's reading UFO digest.

591
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,920
 She probably still wondering where her album went.

592
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,200
 But anyways, he gives her the camera now.

593
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,080
 She doesn't really think anything of it.

594
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
 But she's super excited.

595
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
 Yay, El Gran Combo!

596
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,440
 I'm gonna go get these photos developed.

597
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,120
 She goes against the photos developed and there's like some photos of concert, a couple

598
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,880
 of photos of the band and then the last four photographs are fighter jets attacking the

599
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 UFO.

600
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,320
 So she goes home and she wakes up Amore.

601
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,200
 She's like what, what, what is this dude?

602
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,520
 And he's like what, what?

603
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,240
 And then he says when he sees the UFO, when he sees the photo, he immediately then remembers

604
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,400
 everything that happened on the ship.

605
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,720
 So sorry, I forgot that part.

606
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
 He wakes up in the car on earth.

607
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,360
 He doesn't remember anything.

608
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
 He sees the UFO.

609
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,840
 He takes the photos.

610
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,080
 He goes home and then his aunt shows him the photo and he goes, the great infinite space

611
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,760
 with 20 Puerto Ricans and then the story floods back to him and then he goes back to sleep.

612
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
 The end.

613
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,400
 The story ends with him going, oh no, I've envisioned this horrible catastrophe in Puerto

614
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,440
 Rico and my journey in it and then he goes back to sleep.

615
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,680
 And we end with this final statement of this UFO manifesto thing.

616
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,520
 I don't know what's the term for it.

617
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,440
 Amore fainted again and slept all day long.

618
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,880
 This is like a Berenstein Bear Book.

619
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,040
 Amore fainted again and slept all day long.

620
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,360
 He was just not ready to cope with the facts of the spectacular event that was so frightening

621
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,520
 to him the night before.

622
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,560
 And then Sister Bear said goodnight as well.

623
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,800
 So that's the story of Amore Rivera.

624
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,560
 I find that story fascinating because one, we have a photograph.

625
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,360
 It may be fake, but it's still a photograph.

626
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,800
 Two, it plays into a, personally I think this guy is too stupid to make this story up.

627
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,960
 It plays into a lot of tropes of the aliens trying to save the world thing.

628
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,520
 A lot of times it's some sort of environmental thing, but these aliens are like, Puerto Rico

629
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,040
 is doomed unless you do something.

630
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,360
 That poor teenager.

631
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,960
 And the thing is, is like you imagine the disaster never happened.

632
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,800
 There was no massive earthquake that split the island in half, but that teenager probably

633
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,760
 to this day is sitting out of a bunch of water.

634
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,320
 I'm going to look up, see who famous Puerto Rican water people are.

635
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,360
 Not like they're actual swamp people.

636
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,320
 Let's see if there's a Puerto Rican who owns a giant water company.

637
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
 Hold on.

638
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,880
 Nah, I couldn't find any.

639
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,440
 I was hoping to find something like in 1988 a teenager decided to drop out of high school.

640
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
 Wait no, you don't want to do that.

641
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,040
 In 1988 you want to stay in school, kids.

642
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:12,920
 1988 a dropout went back to high school, stopped pissing in people's lawns at 4.30 in the morning

643
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,280
 and built one of the biggest aquifers in the state of Puerto Rico.

644
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
 Except they're not a state yet.

645
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,640
 They're in their own country.

646
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,360
 But you know what we mean.

647
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,280
 And now this man is able to give 50,000 people water at a moment's notice.

648
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,720
 So hats off to you local businesses in Puerto Rico.

649
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,280
 I was hoping to, instead I found out that 60% of Puerto Rico's water supply is lost due

650
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,600
 to theft and leaks.

651
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,800
 So they definitely have a problem over there.

652
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,000
 So if you exist, if this story is real, if you exist teenager man but no longer a teenager,

653
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 fix that dude.

654
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,200
 Don't worry about the 50,000 people.

655
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,240
 Just fix those leaks.

656
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 And theft.

657
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,000
 Who's stealing water?

658
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,640
 What mad max world do you live in where people are like I'm not paying for this?

659
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,200
 You're drilling holes in the pipes before they get to the houses.

660
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,240
 Sweet, sweet water.

661
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,120
 But that is the story of a Mori Rivera.

662
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,600
 True or false?

663
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
 It's very very entertaining.

664
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
 I personally think the answer is somewhere in the middle.

665
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,240
 This guy may have been abducted because he just sounds too dumb to make this story up.

666
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,800
 And the photograph is a double edged sword.

667
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,480
 Because it's either a real photograph and if so that's amazing evidence that it's a

668
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,160
 pretty obscure story.

669
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,520
 But if it's a fake photograph that he faked to back up a possibly real story then you've

670
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,480
 just muddy the waters.

671
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
 But if the story is true it's nice to think that maybe not all aliens are jerks who abduct

672
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,480
 people at night and like poke them and suck all the blood out of cows and do all sorts

673
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 of stuff.

674
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,400
 Maybe they do want to help us.

675
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,200
 Maybe they do want to prepare the earth for upcoming calamities which is fine with me

676
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,160
 as long as I'm not one of the guys that has to do anything to prepare for the end of the

677
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
 world.

678
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,160
 I would much rather sit here contentedly while some teenager brings me water every day.

679
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,960
