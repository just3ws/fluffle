00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Today we have two terrifying stories of teenage life.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,640
 First off, a group of teenage vigilantes try to stop a crime but end up becoming part of one.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,720
 And then we travel back to the year 1988, where a slumber party turns into a horror movie

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,160
 when four girls are visited from beyond the stars today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:35,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,960
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. This one actually I'm

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,000
 recording really late, so I apologize for that for the people who listen to it day of.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
 It's just been a weird day. I think something's kind of going around the city of Hood River.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,640
 Everyone's getting kind of sick and I'm not technically saying I'm sick, but I'm feeling

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
 a little lazy today. A little bit lazy today. So let's go ahead and get this episode started.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,960
 We are headed off to the city of Vista, California. Hop in to Jason Jalopy. We're going to go for a

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,920
 ride. It's October 2019 and there's a guy named Robert Dreyfus. Allegedly, I'm sure there is

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
 actually a guy named Robert Dreyfus, but this particular Robert Dreyfus will allegedly be

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,880
 involved in these acts. There's a guy named Roger Dreyfus. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 he's not an actual tick. That's not a noise he makes when his claws, his little legs are hitting

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,440
 the ground. That's him typing on a keyboard. "Ooh, baby. Yeah. Mm-mm-mm. Yeah, I can't wait to be

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,080
 all perverted with you." And who he's talking with is not just a normal shopkeeper. He's not going

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,840
 into 7-11. He's like, "Yeah, I'd like a couple Slim Jims, a lottery ticket, and can't wait to

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,360
 be perverted with you." And they're like, "What?" No, he's talking to underage girls online. Again,

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,800
 it's not his mandibles that are clicking together that's making that noise. He is a human bean.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,480
 He's typing very, very loudly. So now let's jump to the other side of this conversation here.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,640
 We're watching this little tick, we're watching this little insectoid man typing away. We now

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,400
 teleport to who he's typing to. You're like, "Jason, Jason, no, no, no, I don't want to teleport

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
 into the room of a 12-year-old girl talking to a sexual predator." And I'm like, "But we're not.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
 We're actually teleporting into the room of a 16-year-old girl talking to a predator." And

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,520
 she's part of a group of vigilantes that they go online pretending to be younger girls and then get

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,320
 these guys to show up in person and they can videotape them and say, "Ha, you've broken the law,

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,040
 evil doer. We're going to send this to the police." Now, there's actually a big community on YouTube

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,320
 that does it. I don't know if these girls are doing this for YouTube, but they definitely

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,520
 were doing this. Now, the girl who's currently posing as an even younger girl turns around and

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,560
 goes, "Let's get them girls. Let's suit up." And they're like putting on their armor. Actually,

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,320
 they're just putting on their jackets. And they've arranged a date with this guy, October 6th, 2019.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,720
 We're ready to go, girls. Let's hop into the, let's just hop in our dad's Tesla, driving on the road.

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:17,440
 I can't say copyrighted theme song can't do that. That is the theme song for the pervert

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,680
 busters. They have a siren on their car. It's a "wow, wow, wow, wow." They're driving through the city.

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,720
 And so they arranged, this is all true, but okay, that's not true. They don't have, I don't know if

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,360
 their dad owned a Tesla. They don't have an alarm on their car, but a group of girls were going to

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,240
 start busting these perverts. It's start being the operative word because as far as I can tell,

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,360
 this is their first and most likely last time they've tried doing this. So they talked to this guy,

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,120
 half man, half insect, Robert Dreyfus. They arranged a meetup for October 6th, 2019, two days after

41
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,240
 my birthday. So I was just chilling. Two days while this story was taking place, I was, I don't know.

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,200
 I was two days older. No, I was more than two days older. It doesn't matter. The point is, is that my

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,880
 birthday is October 4th. Remember that? Send me presents. October 6th, 2019. The sting is ready.

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,880
 The girl standing on the street corner, dolled up and the dudes driving Robert Dreyfus is driving

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,800
 in his car. He has, yes, delicious sugar, sugar in the woman. I see the sugar. It looks so sweet.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,160
 He's driving down the road. Apparently now he's the bug monster from Men in Black.

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
 He sees this young girl on the side of the road. He pulls up, get in, get into my car. He puts on

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
 his human voice now. Get into my car. And again, this is a whole thing where the girls are going

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,480
 to be like, "Ha ha, you're a pervert and we're going to turn you into the police." But the guy

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,520
 pulls up and the girl standing there and he goes, "Get in the car." And she goes, "No, no, no, no.

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,760
 You get out of the car." And he's like, "No, no, no. Get in the car." Now, I'm not going to say

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,440
 teenagers are stupid. In a battle of wit, there's a reason why we use words like predator and prey.

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,800
 The reason why those words kind of matter is in a battle of the wits, generally someone who has

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,440
 been in this situation before, allegedly, will be better equipped for throwing curveballs and for

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
 being able to roll with the punches. And prey generally gets eaten. They don't get to learn

56
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,240
 from their mistakes, right? So this dude is trying a sweet talk. "Sugar, sugar, get in the car. Sugar."

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
 And she is like, "No, no, no." And eventually, so her friends are like hiding behind the corner,

58
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
 right? With cameras ready. And they see their friends standing out in the car, pulls up and the

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,200
 guy is like talking to her. And she's like, "What's Suzy saying? I don't know. I don't know

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,240
 what Suzy's saying." Apparently, they're all 50s health. "Wousewives, loose seal balls behind the

61
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,520
 corner eating a bunch of chocolate." And they see their friend talking. "Come on, Ethel." And then

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,920
 they see their friend still talking to this guy and the guy beckoning her to get in the car. And

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,960
 they're like, "Don't do it. Don't do it." And she gets in the car. And the car drives away.

64
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,200
 Now, at this point, all the friends are staring at each other. They all got their cameras ready

65
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:05,040
 and they're like, "Uh, that's not what was supposed to happen, right?" I never saw that in the YouTube

66
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,280
 video. So the girl is now captive of this guy. Now, she pulls out her cell phone and she starts

67
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,880
 texting her friends, "Uh, hey guys, you won't believe what happened, but you know what I've

68
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,880
 been talking to?" Who's a known sexual predator allegedly. She's typing out allegedly. "Yeah,

69
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,040
 I'm in his car now. Remember that whole sting thing where we were gonna like bust this dude?

70
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,760
 Yeah, I got in his car. Help, help. Little emoji, little screaming emoji." And the girl's called

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,720
 the police. Now, luckily, they were standing around next to the car. They, well, they knew who the guy

72
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,120
 was. They knew his real name. They could get his license plate number and all that stuff. So very,

73
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,880
 very shortly after all this happened, cops driving on the road, a real police officer,

74
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,520
 not a vigilante, not driving his dad's Tesla. He's driving on the road. APB comes in for, you

75
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,240
 know what? It used to be APB, which is all points bulletin. Now it's Bolo, be on the lookout for.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
 And maybe they mean two different things now, but, and so anyways, the cops driving on the road

77
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
 and he sees his car drive by and he's like, "Hmm, that's interesting. We're supposed to have a

78
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
 be on the lookout for vehicle matching the description." Plus, I'm also very, very concerned

79
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,200
 about the antennae. Bullsh*tting out of that man's head. Neow, neow, neow, neow. Pulls him over.

80
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,560
 Young girl in passenger seat. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, officer. She was in the car when I bought it.

81
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,720
 I don't know this girl. She's just like, she just lives in this car. He gets arrested and he's charged

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,240
 with kidnapping, sending harmful material to a minor and communication with a minor for specific

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
 offenses. And that's an actual law that you can break. And the cops basically were like, in and

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,640
 out, they have to really seize things every once in a while in the news. Don't be a, don't be a

85
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,440
 crime fighter. Don't be a vigilante. If you want to help, join the police or don't do that. I mean,

86
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,080
 there's other ways you can help raise money for them, I guess. Like, I don't know if you can hold,

87
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,120
 I don't know if you can hold a big sale for the police, but basically don't do this. And definitely

88
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,280
 if you are going to do this, don't, don't, don't climb into their car. Because really at the end

89
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,480
 of the day, it could have ended a lot worse, right? I guess that goes without saying. So

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,280
 we don't know. It's this guy's probably going to go to jail. He was caught red.

91
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:28,080
 What are, what's an insect's legs called? He was caught red that and he's currently doing time

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,000
 in a roach hotel. And then, this doesn't make sense, but I'm just going to roll with it. It's

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,880
 going to be a long episode. Just imagine Robert Dreyfus now sitting in a colony full of the worst

94
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,120
 bugs ever. That doesn't, that makes even less sense. Who are the worst bugs ever? Like, is it just one

95
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,040
 of each species or is their actual name the bugs? Bugs Bunny Mate? Okay, we're done with the bug

96
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,800
 jokes. Don't be a bug. Don't be an insect. It's moral number one. Don't be an insectoid human.

97
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,720
 Two, if you're going to be a vigilante, don't get into, there's never a part where Batman's like,

98
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,800
 I have to defeat Joker. But first, I must get in his vehicle and let him drive me away. And then

99
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
 the last moral, what was the first one? Oh yeah, don't be a bug. And the second one was, oh, don't

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,120
 climb into people's cars. I think the biggest moral of the story is, so yes, yes, moral of the

101
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,320
 story. I think those are it. Don't be a bug. Don't climb into people's cars. Don't climb into people's

102
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,920
 cars if their bugs is a good combination of those two. And then girls, be careful of bug people.

103
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,920
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next, let's repair the train wreck that was, I like that story.

104
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 Kind of went off the rails in the ending with the bug, the bug motel worst bugs ever. Bugs sitting

105
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,720
 in cells, lifting weights. Hey, cockroach guy, your time's up. And it's like dead roach walking and

106
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,680
 the, the roach is like walking down the, the ramp. And then they have to put them in like a big old

107
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,440
 electric chair. He's like, okay, you know, the worst part is the worst part is one, I'm leaving

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
 that in, I'm not going to edit that out. Two, I as I was saying it, I perfectly imagined it like I

109
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,760
 imagine the grimy walls of the bug prison, the giant cockroach walking down and then the guards

110
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,080
 were also bugs for some reason. Like in my head, it wasn't like humans, but the cockroach was walking

111
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,960
 like a regular cockroach, but the guards had on like guard uniforms and they were standing up

112
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,880
 and walking on two legs. Anyways, the theater of the mind people. I wonder if you imagined it the

113
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,280
 same way I did other bugs looking out the cells as the cockroach is walking to his, can you electric

114
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,640
 you to cockroach? I'm sure you can. Okay, that segment is over. Let's go ahead and move on

115
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,360
 to our next story. Our next story is from our 1988 file. Now, our 1988 file is a collection of UFO

116
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,160
 encounters that I found from 1988. It's all from this website called thinkaboutitdocs.com

117
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
 show notes though it'll be in the show notes. It's a really cool collection of stuff. Now,

118
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,160
 I'm actually have already moved on to 1987's UFO files, but I still have a ton of stuff from 1988

119
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,240
 and I kind of put these in as short little things that I can read off to you that are

120
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
 pretty creepy. It's hard to verify. So it's mostly just the story as it stands. So let's take a look

121
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:30,160
 at one of these. It's June 24th, 1988. Bing! We're out of Vista, California. We're now in Redmond,

122
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:39,840
 Washington. It's 2am and we are now teenage girls. You're like, Jason, Jason, come on man.

123
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,280
 You just did a story about a pervert trying to kidnize young girls on the internet and now we're

124
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,480
 at a slumber party and not only that word teenage girls and I'm like, bro, just roll with it. Okay?

125
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
 Sorry, the folly of youth. That's the theme of this episode. It's stuff that happens to kids.

126
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,240
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't really, you could have explained that in the intro. No, no, no, no.

127
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,240
 As we're having this conversation, I'm doing my ponytail. I'm like, how does it look? No,

128
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,680
 no, no, not ponytail. I want pigtails. I want like the little, what's those things? Not pigtails. I

129
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,080
 want the ones that like, it's like two ponytails sticking out of the side of my head. Right? I

130
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,800
 want those. You're like, Jason, this is oddly detailed for your slumber party fantasy. I'm like,

131
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:34,000
 oh, you. So we walk into this, walk into this teenage girl slumber party, but we're girls. So

132
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,240
 it's less creepy, right? I guess, okay, we're not going to, we're not going to think about the

133
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,400
 implications of this all. We are now at a girls slumber party. Okay. So let's take a look at this.

134
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,680
 On June 24th, 1988, four girls are having a slumber party and one of them lost their puppy.

135
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,640
 That's the noise I'm making because I'm sad when puppies are losing, but they can also out in the

136
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:11,680
 darkness here. I can hear their lost puppy outside. Oh no. Where's, where's her puppy? It's lost and

137
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
 their faces are pressed against the window and we're like looking out into the darkness too.

138
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,320
 You're like, Jason, quit making that noise. I'm like, sorry, it's sad. And we don't see a puppy

139
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:33,760
 out in the spacious backyard, but what we see off in the distance is a hovering disc shaped craft.

140
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,760
 Me and you look at each other and we're like, oh, this is what we're here for. Like, yeah, sure,

141
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
 missing puppies are sad and all, but this is a dead rabbit radio episode. But the, so we were

142
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,440
 expecting something weird, right? But the girls aren't. They just want to have a slumber party and

143
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:57,600
 read books and talk about boys. And instead they're seeing this vehicle. It had white and red lights

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:06,880
 and you can see a little faint green light. And we see it descend down. So now it's lower than the

145
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,280
 tree line. Oh, there was a forest back there, by the way. So was there weren't, there's not,

146
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,200
 it's Redmond Washington. So there's trees everywhere. So looking out into this dark forest,

147
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:22,400
 we see this UFO disappear behind the tree line. Now later in the evening, we're all in the house

148
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,200
 together, right? Party time. Dun dun dun dun dun. That was a hit song in 1988. Actually, no, it would

149
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,440
 have been 1988 would have been like, straight up now tell me, do you really want to love? And we're

150
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,360
 listening to some Paul Abdul and I'm brave. I'm changing my hairstyle and you're super irritated

151
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,280
 in your corner. You're like, dude, that better not have been it. We better not be at the slumber party

152
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,320
 for that. Yes, UFO sighting is cool, but come on, man. And I'm sitting there dancing, singing into

153
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
 a comb, singing, not in a comb, singing into a hairbrush, straight up now tell me, you're like,

154
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,200
 oh my god, I'm like, no, no, no, you can be MC scat cat. And I'm giving you a hairbrush. You're

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,520
 like, dude, tell me there's something else. Or I'm leaving. I'm leaving this slumber party.

156
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,560
 I'm like, don't worry, there'll be something else. But first we got to sing a duet. And as we're singing

157
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,920
 boys to men, Mariah Carey's one sweet day, two of the other girls leave the party. They're like,

158
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,520
 oh man, that's singing. It's terrible. Two of the girls leave the slumber party and they're walking

159
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,040
 through the house looking for something to eat. I wonder if there's some food in the fridge and

160
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,480
 these two girls are walking. Now, the way the house is laid out is I don't know actually,

161
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 but the way, sorry, but according to my notes, the way that it works is that where the girls are

162
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,080
 at, there's a staircase leading up to the kitchen. So I'm assuming the slumber party's in the basement,

163
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:56,160
 right? And these girls are walking through the house and they see the staircase leading up to

164
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,760
 the kitchen and they see the open door. They see the kitchen and they're like, oh yes, beyond that

165
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,160
 door is nourishment for our little tummies. And they go to walk up the stairs and a figure

166
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,280
 stands in front of the door at the top of the stairs, a shadow staring down at them.

167
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:21,440
 And the girls take off running. At this point, it's like three in the morning. The girls take

168
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,040
 off running and the girls run in and they shut off our song in the middle of it and you're like,

169
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,000
 oh sweet relief. And the girls are like crying, they're freaking out. And they go, there's someone

170
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
 in the house. There's somebody in the house. They're in the kitchen. Now, of course, there's

171
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,640
 adults in the house, but they could just tell from the silhouette of the shadow this wasn't an

172
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,560
 occupant. You know how you have that feeling in your pit of the stomach that something's wrong?

173
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,040
 That's what these girls felt. Now, the girls are panicked. The adults in the house are upstairs

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,680
 past the shadow. So the girls jump in their sleeping bags. I brought a sleeping bag.

175
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,720
 You did it. So we're going to get into the same sleeping bag, zip it up and cover it up over our

176
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:12,960
 heads. The room is silent. All of these girls hiding in their sleeping bags. The ultimate defense,

177
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,000
 something that children do when they're scared of the boogeyman, a monster under their bed,

178
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,400
 covered themselves with a blanket. The room is quiet. The air is still.

179
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:35,040
 And then one of the girls pulls her sleeping bag away from her face and sees in front of her,

180
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:48,080
 staring right at her a green humanoid with pointy ears, bushy eyebrows, and red glowing eyes.

181
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,520
 She gasps and makes every other girl in the room react. And according to this report,

182
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:04,880
 when they removed the sleeping bag as well, they saw that face. Each girl saw that face staring

183
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,320
 at them. You have four girls all peeking out of their sleeping bag, each seeing a green-skinned

184
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,360
 red-eyed face staring directly at them. The figure disappears from view. And then,

185
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,680
 from where they're at, they can see the stairway leading up to the kitchen, and they can see lights.

186
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:36,000
 Multi-colored lights flashing in the darkness of the kitchen. True story? Who knows? It was reported

187
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,640
 by something called UFO Information Service and then eventually reported on thinkabout@docs.com.

188
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,800
 Now, we've covered them a couple of times. A lot of their stuff does wash out. Again,

189
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,360
 not saying the story is true, but none of the stories I've come across so far seems like it

190
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,160
 was made up by this website. They do actually seem to co-olate a lot of existing reports.

191
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,680
 I think it's crea- Obviously, the idea of a bunch of kids having a slumber party is, it's such a

192
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,320
 symbol of childhood innocence, and you're near your parents, but also separated from them. That

193
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,040
 element of it is creepy. An object or a creature standing in between you and adult help is creepy.

194
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,360
 The idea of everyone seeing the same thing, again, according to the way that they word this,

195
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,480
 it makes it seem like each person sees the face from where they're sitting or where they're laying.

196
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,080
 But that idea doesn't mean there was four of them. Doesn't mean that this creature actually,

197
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,400
 no matter where you were at, was right in front of you. There was only one creature,

198
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,120
 because there was only one shadow, but no matter where you were at, it was right in front of you.

199
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,000
 So, you have an idea of like interdimensional, perception, altering things. And then you always

200
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,640
 have to think of, they were hiding, they looked, they saw the face, it disappeared. Is there any

201
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,920
 sort of lost time? This story is taking place at three in the morning. It's really easy to lose time

202
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,640
 late at night. When you're driving down the road and you're supposed to be at home by five,

203
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,960
 and the next thing you know, it's seven, and you're down some dirt road, you can be like,

204
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,520
 whoa, I lost time. If you go to bed at 10 p.m., and you wake up at 6 a.m., you could have been

205
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,240
 abducted at any point during your sleep. You would never notice the time was lost. So, were these

206
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,040
 girls, did anything else happen to these girls, were they abducted? Was it all a made-up story

207
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,960
 and these four girls thought it'd be really funny to tell the story? Who knows? But it's creepy,

208
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,480
 nonetheless. The next time you get invited to a slumber party, you may want to think,

209
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:40,160
 I don't think that's a great idea. So, when you go to bed tonight, think of this. You won't

210
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 really know what happens to you while you're sleeping. Because it's possible that this vehicle

211
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,200
 knew those four girls were going to be in that house secluded at that time,

212
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,920
 but didn't think they were going to be awake. And as that vehicle descended into the forest,

213
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:10,480
 and its occupant from another time, another place, another world, marched silently through the dark

214
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:18,560
 woods towards that house. Slipped into it without a key, without turning a lock.

215
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:26,640
 Stood at the top of the stairs and saw two young girls frightened at the bottom.

216
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,600
 That's when the entity would have thought they're awake.

217
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,640
 But I still have a mission. And then it slowly walked down the stairs

218
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:49,760
 to find four sleeping bags zipped shut. Young girls terrified inside.

219
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:59,120
 But this creature had come from a long ways away. Nothing would stop it now.

220
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
 The girls would just have a memory of a face in front of them,

221
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,920
 a disappearance, and some multicolored lights emanating from a dark kitchen.

222
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:22,080
 But the alien shadow would remember more, would remember it all.

223
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,600
 What will you remember when you wake up tomorrow morning? Will you remember nothing?

224
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,520
 Will you be one of the few that remembers everything? The experiments, the terror,

225
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,160
 the isolation, the powerlessness? Or will you just meet them in the middle?

226
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,520
 And all you will remember is a glimpse of waking up in the middle of the night.

227
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,880
 To a green face and red glowing eyes staring right at you.
