1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
 the worst story you'll ever hear about a Catholic priest.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,000
 And puppies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,800
 [Music]

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
 Hi everyone, I don't know what was up with that.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
 I don't know what was up with that but uh, hey everyone this is Jason Carpenter here

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
 with Dead Rabbit Radio. Another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,920
 It's a beautiful Tuesday night here. It's very, the temperature is great.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
 You know it's funny I always talk about the temperature at the beginning of this.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
 Like anybody really cares, people are listening to this all over the world.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
 But maybe you can expect, maybe you're also sitting somewhere and the temperature's good

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
 and you're like, "Yeah, Jason, I know what it's like."

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,120
 We got a great episode for you today and I gotta admit it's a little bit,

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
 a little bit by the skin of my teeth I think.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,800
 You know, like I always say, 41 years old.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,360
 And there is a time and a place for video games.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:20,480
 And for me, that time was my 20s and that place was in my 20s, if that makes sense.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,680
 I uh, the other day, I don't, I very, very play video games nowadays.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,480
 I played them a lot in my 20s. I'd get off work, I'd go home, I'd play Battlefield 2.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,160
 I always had the system, I'd play Battlefield 2 until we won.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
 And I'd always play Rando servers.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
 Hop on a server, I'd play Battlefield 2 until my team won.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
 And then I would continue to play until we lost.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,480
 And then once we lost, I would continue to play until we won again.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,120
 So I was about 24, 25.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,240
 I was playing till 3, 4 in the morning.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
 And that's very common for other people, of that age group even today.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
 But I noticed that I was a musician back then.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,440
 I didn't have a band, I had to do everything myself.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,440
 That sounds really sad, but it was actually, it actually was cool.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,680
 So every minute that I spent playing video games, I wasn't working on my music.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,200
 And I've always recognized that going forward.

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
 And I kind of found a balance.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
 And then just as time went on, I just didn't find video games as fulfilling as I do now.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,280
 And they're great.

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,680
 You know, for people who find a lot of enjoyment in them, I'm not knocking them, per se.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
 Just I've kind of grown out of them.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
 Well, the other day, they had the Steam Sale.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
 And there was a bunch of games that I've never played that I wanted.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,880
 Then I got like Saints Row 4, which I played Saints Row 3 forever.

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,240
 But anyways, and so I loaded it up.

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,280
 And in the past two days, I've just been playing it now.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,040
 I've obviously been finding room to, I have play practice and I'm hanging out with my friends

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
 and I'm doing this podcast.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
 But out of those three things, the podcast is something that only I can move forward on.

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
 No one's really making me do it.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
 And it's something about the game, the process of playing the game itself.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,960
 It just seems to suck the energy out of me.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,600
 I played it last night after I got done editing the podcast.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,960
 So we'll get this morning and I thought, okay, you know, I'll play a little Saints Row.

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
 But first, let me get some stuff done.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,520
 I really don't, you know, want to be playing video games in the middle of the day.

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,960
 Well, sure enough, by the time 11 o'clock in the morning rolls around and playing Saints Row 4.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,480
 And then I do my normal thing where I go for my big walk and I go talk to my friends and

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,360
 I come home and I'm like, oh, should I play some more Saints Row?

55
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,320
 I was like, no, dude, take a nap.

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,360
 Take a nap.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 It's almost like, I feel like the problem with video games for me is I've,

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,720
 I've, I see the mouse wheel now where I'm jumping around on building to building.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
 I see all these little blue orbs throughout the city that I'm collecting for power ups in this

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,280
 game. It's a, it's a good game, but there's a sense of accomplishment every time I get a blue orb.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,800
 You just, there's this noise.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,320
 I think there's an applause sound effect and you go back up to the, uh, another building,

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,560
 you look down and you've collected like 10 orbs and the, now the city looks clean.

64
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,120
 It doesn't look as cluttered as it was before.

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
 And so you feel the sense of accomplishment.

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
 I accomplished nothing at all.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,200
 But I feel the sense of accomplishment and that's what happens is that ends up replacing

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,120
 the sense of accomplishment I generally find by doing stuff like this.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
 So I have to work around that.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
 So I mean, if you, if video games are your thing, that's cool.

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,040
 They used to be mine.

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,960
 You just have to be aware that they are kind of like accomplishment engines.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,800
 And a lot of times it will replace stuff that you actually will feel more proud of doing.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
 You know what I've, I've, I find fascinating.

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
 I find a lot of things fascinating, but this is one thing in particular I think is fascinating,

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,360
 because I honestly, we think that there's so much stuff that only we do

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
 and millions of other people do it.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
 Cause we kind of do get lost in our own heads and there are things that we don't really talk

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
 to other people about.

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,800
 So we just assume we're the only ones who do it.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
 Couple of, I don't know, maybe a year or two ago it was online.

82
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,840
 And so it's funny because it's hard to explain without being,

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,480
 it being embarrassing, but I mean, most people do it, but again, it is still pretty embarrassing.

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,680
 So a couple of years ago or a year or two ago, at the time limit doesn't matter.

85
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,480
 I don't know why I was reading this thing online and someone said, do you guys,

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:41,600
 did you, do you remember being a kid and listening to a song and perfectly imagining

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
 the movie you would make cut to that song?

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
 And I was like, whoa, I thought, I thought that was a Jason thing.

89
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,920
 Like I'd be listening to a, to a cool song when I was a kid.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,560
 I don't know.

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:03,600
 You got the touch or I don't know, you know, Metallica song.

92
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
 Let's be a little, okay.

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
 You got the touch when I was younger.

94
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,320
 Let's do something off Metallica Black.

95
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,960
 Let's do something that, that, that, that.

96
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,920
 Anyway, the Wolf song from Metallica on Metallica, Metallica Black, the Wolf song,

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,960
 the Wolf and me or whatever.

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,240
 Anyways, it's pointless.

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
 I'm getting off track.

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,320
 So, and I was like, whoa, I thought it was just a Jason thing, like sitting there and listening

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,920
 to a cool song and like walking down the street and being like, yeah, when I make this movie,

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,880
 I'm going to use this song for the trailer and here's going to be my cut stuff.

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,080
 And then someone else said, yeah, remember, did you ever daydream that you were like,

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
 that you were like a master musician and you were going to play the talent show and impress

105
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,040
 the girl of your dreams?

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,800
 And I was like, okay, I, again, I thought only I had that daydream.

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
 I don't know how to play the guitar.

108
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,720
 I don't know how to play any musical instrument by, by any stretch of the imagination.

109
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,520
 I don't even think I could play the triangle effectively.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
 But I, you have that daydream.

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
 You're like, yeah, I'm going to get this six, like this cool sick, sick string guitar.

112
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,240
 And then Molly Madigan is going to be there in the audience.

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
 When I went around, I went around, I went around.

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
 She was like, oh, Jason.

115
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,520
 So bizarre.

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,800
 You know, and then people just started posting all of these daydreams that they used to have

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
 in their kids that are super cringy now.

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,480
 You know, it's funny because a lot of the daydreams like that one, I'm a writer.

119
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,560
 So we've all revolved around me, like again, making a movie or writing a book.

120
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,200
 And I'm like, yeah.

121
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,960
 And then like, as that scene in the movies playing, this song's playing, you're like,

122
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,680
 imagining it perfectly in your head how the story is going to match the song,

123
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,520
 or the talent show daydream where you're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to go to the talent show.

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
 And I'm going to be like an awesome break dancer.

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,880
 And, you know, all the cute girls are going to be like, oh, Kelly O'Dowd is going to be like, oh.

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
 Was it O'Dowd or was it O'Dell?

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,240
 Kelly O'Dell.

128
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,800
 I don't remember.

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,400
 But anyways, the point being that daydreams are fascinating because again, I've never told

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,120
 anybody that.

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
 I've never been like, oh, yeah, when I listen to music, I sit and I imagine perfectly what I'm

132
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,680
 doing.

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
 Or, you know, when I'm listening to like a cool, when I'm listening to Love in the Elevator,

134
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
 yeah, I'm daydreaming about getting on stage in a talent show and be like, loving an elevator.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But millions of other people do it too.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,640
 I'm sure half the people listening to this podcast have done it.

137
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,040
 Listening to a song and they're imagining how they'll perform that song at karaoke bar and

138
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,080
 everyone will be like, yeah, even though you're a terrible singer, you probably don't know half

139
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
 the lyrics in real life.

140
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
 Daydreaming keeps us alive.

141
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,960
 I love daydreaming.

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
 They dream all the time.

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
 And again, not trying to hammer the point, but I'm a writer.

144
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,400
 So daydreaming is just part of the writing process.

145
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,120
 It allows you, it's basically like working out your brain.

146
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,280
 I meet people who say they don't have an imagination weird to me.

147
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,840
 That's weird to me because my imagination is so vivid.

148
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,640
 What is even more weird to me is when I meet people, I've met maybe, I've met a couple people who've

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 said I don't have an imagination, which generally what means that they don't have a vivid imagination

150
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,240
 or they just don't have an imagination on the level of myself or a writer or a creative person.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
 They have an imagination.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,520
 When they read a book, their brain is processing that information on some level.

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,520
 What I find fascinating, I've probably met two or three people like this and I talk,

154
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,400
 I'm the type of person that I'm walking on the street.

155
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,920
 I know people get annoyed by this, but I'm very approachable and I talk to random people all the

156
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,240
 time.

157
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,400
 It's just what I do.

158
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,760
 So I've talked to thousands of thousands of thousands of people throughout my life and I've

159
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,960
 gotten to know very well quite a lot of people.

160
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,480
 I'm just kind of open.

161
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,640
 I've met an out of that huge group of people that I've met and talked to.

162
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
 I've met two people, maybe three people who have said they don't like music.

163
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
 And I remember the first time this girl told me that she goes,

164
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 "We're, I think we're out on a date or something like that.

165
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,480
 I don't remember."

166
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,000
 I don't know why I included that, but anyways, the point is that we were talking and she says,

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
 "Yeah, I don't like music."

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,320
 And I kind of took me back and I go, "You don't like modern music?

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,280
 Like pop music?"

170
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,240
 And she goes, "No, I don't like music.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,120
 I don't like the way it sounds."

172
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,840
 Now, I don't like eggs.

173
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,960
 I don't eat eggs.

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,080
 I've never eaten an egg.

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,440
 People who eat eggs and I go, "I don't eat eggs."

176
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
 They're like, "Oh, okay.

177
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,080
 That's kind of weird that you're an adult.

178
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
 You've never eaten an egg, but you know whatever."

179
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,640
 But there's tons of other food, I guess is my point.

180
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
 Like then they'll go, "Well, you do eat other food, correct?"

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
 And I was like, "Oh yeah, I had hamburgers and tacos and pizza or whatnot."

182
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
 So if someone goes, "I don't like country music," you go, "Oh, okay.

183
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,560
 You know that's fair enough.

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
 I like hip hop."

185
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
 And they're like, "Yeah, I don't like that either."

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,200
 And I'm like, "Okay."

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,800
 But for someone to say they don't like music, to me is the equivalent of someone just flat

188
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
 out saying, "I don't like food."

189
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
 It's annoying when I have to eat it.

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,520
 I don't like it.

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,960
 I don't like it in your life.

192
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
 You don't like some of it.

193
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,600
 No, I don't like any of it.

194
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
 I don't like any food.

195
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,280
 So I've met three people maybe four, I think between two and four people, which is three, but

196
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,680
 who don't like music.

197
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,480
 They don't like it.

198
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
 They don't like the way it sounds.

199
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
 It doesn't move them.

200
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
 It doesn't energize them.

201
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
 That, yeah, and they just don't like it.

202
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,520
 And what's weird is imagine being in their shoes.

203
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,080
 In a world that is dominated by music, you can't watch a commercial without music.

204
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,480
 Every movie who has music, people walking down the street humming, and you don't like music.

205
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,040
 Talk about stranger in a strange land because you would really exist in a world that everyone

206
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
 is connected to and you just don't like it.

207
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,960
 I think music is more essential than something.

208
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 It's more, music is more universal than ideas of like religion.

209
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,400
 It's fascinating to me that some of you can have 30% of the world population be like,

210
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
 "No, I'm agnostic."

211
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,280
 And everyone else goes, "Huh, okay."

212
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,840
 But we don't have 30% of the world's population being like music.

213
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,440
 Hold, no, no music.

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,800
 I don't like it.

215
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
 It has to be a super, super small minority of people like this.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
 I feel bad for her, for her in particular and the other people.

217
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
 And again, they've just kind of said it and it's so weird.

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,280
 And I honestly think that I've asked people, since I've run into those four, I've asked people,

219
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,160
 "Do you, you know, like not, not on the first time I meet you.

220
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,040
 Hey, my name is Jason.

221
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
 Do you like music?"

222
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,640
 But as I get to know people, sometimes I'll bring this story up and I'll kind of mention it to them.

223
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,960
 And other than those three or four people, it's all people are always very incredulous by that.

224
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,600
 How do you not like music?

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,960
 How do you not like music?

226
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,640
 Now, I did do a bit of a clickbaity thing there in the beginning of the video when I said the

227
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
 worst thing a priest has ever done.

228
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,840
 It kind of wraps into this.

229
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,960
 So the Catholic Church has had scandal after scandal after scandal.

230
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,960
 When I was growing up, I actually went to a Catholic school, St. Philip Nairie,

231
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
 graduated in 1988.

232
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
 That's actually its own episode.

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,240
 That's actually its own episode.

234
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,520
 But anyway, so I don't have any personal beef with the Catholic Church.

235
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,440
 When I was a kid, the biggest controversy the Catholic Church had was their beautiful,

236
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,200
 beautiful churches, cathedrals, and surrounded by abject poverty.

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,600
 And I remember even as a kid being like, "Ah, that's, that's, you, there's better ways to

238
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,160
 spend that money."

239
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,160
 And I get it on their argument, basically, is you have a beautiful place to worship the Lord in.

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,200
 But, but whatever.

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,480
 And then obviously as I was growing up, a bigger controversy was the child molestation thing.

242
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,840
 Well, now on top of that, the Catholic Church has decided to come down hard on a priest.

243
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
 So that's no pun intended.

244
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,440
 They decided to go after this priest who seemingly has broken the worst rule in the Catholic Church,

245
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
 because he immediately got suspended for a year.

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,800
 This Catholic Church, this minister was rapping.

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
 This priest was rapping.

248
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,200
 Catholic Church was like, "No rap.

249
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,360
 No rap at all."

250
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,520
 They kicked him out.

251
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
 Well, they didn't kick him out.

252
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,440
 They suspended him for a year.

253
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,240
 You know, the Catholic Church, the reason why they defended pedophilia for so long

254
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
 is because the idea was that the message is more important than the man.

255
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,520
 Why that doesn't cross over to this, this rapping, this rapping priest.

256
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,720
 And I believe he's in Africa.

257
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,200
 I'm having a hard time finding, I know exactly where it is.

258
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,960
 It says it's in Rappogi, which is Maghuri County.

259
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:11,920
 This, I'm going to post the link, but I'm pretty sure that this website is for a specific country.

260
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,840
 So they know where it's at.

261
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,400
 But anyways, anyways, he was rapping.

262
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,280
 He got canned for a year.

263
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,760
 It's rough.

264
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:28,240
 But again, Catholic Church, you got bigger problems going on than rapping priests.

265
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,520
 So a little bit of a clickbaity title, but I just wanted to kind of get that out there.

266
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,480
 Now, I want to tell you a story.

267
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,280
 No, cut, cut, cut.

268
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,840
 You guys are learning how the sausage is made tonight.

269
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,640
 That priest story you just, it's 1130, by the way.

270
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,600
 I've been editing the episode and I'm listening to it.

271
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
 The priest story you just heard is the second version I did.

272
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,760
 And I just edited out maybe another five minutes of it.

273
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,360
 I don't know why it took me so long to tell such a simple story.

274
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
 It was ridiculous.

275
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,680
 And then after that, the story I was going to tell you was a 15 minute long dramatic

276
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,560
 reading of an article that I read about a guy breaking into a little girl's house.

277
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,720
 Now, if you've listened to the podcast, I think you've picked up on that I barely

278
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,240
 comprehend the articles I read as is.

279
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:29,040
 So the fact that somehow I thought that I could do a dramatic reading of an event and not get

280
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,560
 every every possible single detail wrong.

281
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:41,680
 I got some of the details right, but I mean, for the most part, it was wildly, wildly wrong.

282
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,800
 And so I think that dramatic reading is going to go into the vault.

283
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,960
 Maybe I'm maybe I'm overstating how wrong it was, but I definitely got in the state

284
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,520
 where it happened was wrong, which is a big thing.

285
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,920
 And the fact that the guy was a hitchhiker, I called the guy a hitchhiker when in fact

286
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
 he had flown through three planes to get here.

287
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,880
 Here's the story.

288
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
 I'm not going to do dramatic reading.

289
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,520
 This guy met this 14 year old girl on discord.

290
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,400
 The guy is 26.

291
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
 They're talking.

292
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,960
 He obviously has a huge boner for her because he's an idiot.

293
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,200
 I'm sure the girl's a lovely girl.

294
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,120
 I'm not saying that I'm saying he's 26.

295
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,920
 She's 14.

296
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
 He lives in New Zealand.

297
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
 She lives in Gokuchi.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
 Gada Huchi?

299
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,840
 She lives in some city in Virginia or the West Coast or the East Coast or whatever.

300
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,320
 Some place where they name stuff Gada Huchi.

301
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,920
 But anyways, the point being, and I'll find it while I'm looking this up,

302
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,280
 but so he she tries to say, Hey, I want to stop talking to you.

303
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,920
 And he can't take an open answer, which is what it, you know, fairly typical, unfortunately.

304
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,640
 Now, if a girl blows me off, you know what?

305
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
 No, no, no, I'm not even going to go on a side quest.

306
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,760
 I just want to finish the story.

307
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,160
 So I definitely don't want to go on a side quest if a girl blew me off

308
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,040
 when the context is a 14 year old girl.

309
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,680
 But so anyways, this girl blows this dude off.

310
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,560
 He fly takes three planes and not a hitchhiker.

311
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,920
 He takes three planes to America and then travels by Greyhound bus to find her.

312
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,440
 He gets to the girl's home.

313
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,680
 The girl is home with her mother and two sisters and Guchilan,

314
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
 Guchilan, Virginia is where this happened.

315
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,920
 The guy gets to the house and it's the mother and two sisters.

316
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,760
 And he knocks on the door and says, Hey, I'm a hitchhiker.

317
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,720
 Can I use your phone?

318
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
 Which is a terrible way to get into somebody's house.

319
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
 Hi, I'm a loner drifter.

320
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
 Can I please use your phone?

321
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,200
 Say your church bus just blew up or I don't know, a nun, broker leg.

322
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,480
 Anyways, so of course, the mother being a smart woman doesn't let him in.

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,400
 He goes around back.

324
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
 He tries to break in the basement door.

325
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
 The dramatic reading is terrible, by the way.

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,680
 It's terrible.

327
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,400
 But anyways, so I should add it like sound effects.

328
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,040
 But so he comes around and then he breaks through the glass with another detail I got wrong

329
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,560
 in my dramatic reading.

330
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,280
 She shoots him.

331
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,800
 She shoots him once and I said she shot him twice.

332
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,640
 It's just it's just it's a cluster.

333
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,680
 It's a cluster.

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,240
 Anyway, so he could shop the neck and they lifelike amount he's live.

335
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,120
 So when the cops start of investigating this, the girl, they didn't recognize him at first.

336
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
 The girls like, oh, yeah, you know, I talked to that dude.

337
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,360
 Ed, he had a pocket knife on him.

338
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
 Duck tape and pepper spray.

339
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
 And the craziest thing about the whole story.

340
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
 Now this all happened just maybe three days ago in Guchland,

341
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,400
 Guchland, Virginia.

342
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,160
 Of course, the link will be in the show notes.

343
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,520
 But the most interesting thing about the story is that they're like charging him right now.

344
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,200
 The only thing that they're charging him with was breaking and entering with a deadly weapon

345
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
 with intent to commit a serious felony.

346
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
 So that is, I mean, that's a felony.

347
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,120
 But you think like the conspiracy, all the steps you had to go through,

348
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,240
 like all the premeditation of buying the three plane tickets

349
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,440
 and flying out here and having those items on you think they'd get charged with something else.

350
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
 And the police did say, sorry, I'm Yachty.

351
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,720
 I'm tired, man.

352
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,920
 I've been editing this episode for for about an hour and a half just to get it halfway decent.

353
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,040
 And then I was listening to the dramatic read and I was like, I'm throwing it out.

354
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,400
 The cops did say that they're going to turn the case over to the feds to see if he broke

355
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,160
 any federal crimes coming out here.

356
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,400
 So moral of the story, there's a couple moral of the stories.

357
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
 One, don't let random people into your house.

358
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,880
 You'd be surprised how often that happens.

359
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,080
 Two, if you are a serial killer, come up with a better story than your hitchhiker.

360
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,360
 Because then you can't say, you know what, actually in the dramatic reading, I think I said,

361
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,240
 I'm a hitchhiker and my car broke down.

362
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
 There's a possibility that I said that I'm not going to swear to it.

363
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
 That would have been funny if I did.

364
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,640
 It just, the dramatic reading was terrible.

365
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,720
 Lesson one, don't let people in your house.

366
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
 Lesson two, if you want to get in somebody's house, come up with a plausible lie that's going

367
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,320
 to allow you into their house.

368
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,840
 During the day, it could be things like I smell a gas leak.

369
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,280
 Or I see smoke coming out of your back room at night.

370
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
 You're probably better off going through with the brick through the window.

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,760
 But you could also use stuff like, why am I giving tips to their...

372
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,320
 Anyways, anyways, I already gave you enough tips.

373
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,200
 Go during the day.

374
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
 Actually, people are less suspicious during the day.

375
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,360
 Anyways, she was really good that she had a gun and she used it.

376
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
 That's great.

377
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,680
 That's awesome.

378
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,600
 That's what they're for in the home is to protect your house.

379
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 And the dude probably didn't think she had a gun and he ended up getting shot in the neck because

380
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:43,920
 of it.

381
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,120
 So he lived, so that's cool.

382
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,000
 Like I'm not saying he'd let the justice system take care of that.

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,080
 And she protected herself and her kids, so that's cool.

384
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,400
 I learned a lesson tonight.

385
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,160
 Dramatic readings is something that I may want to have more information on before I start doing it.

386
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,520
 So maybe that'll be something we do in the future.

387
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
 It was just way too long.

388
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,120
 The episode was running way too long and I just had to chop it up.

389
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,560
 So I'm going to go back to the original recording now.

390
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,800
 So I promised you a puppy story and it's kind of a puppy story.

391
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,520
 This is that I was super excited to share it with you.

392
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,400
 But then as I started to talk about it or think about it, it is a video,

393
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,360
 which again doesn't go very well with the podcast.

394
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,320
 So I'm going to describe it to you in as adorable terms as possible.

395
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,080
 And I'll put the link below.

396
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,320
 There's a police officer.

397
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,000
 He falls down.

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,520
 Spoiler alert.

399
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
 He's just acting.

400
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,040
 And then out of frame, this little puppy, this little puppy runs up and sees that his

401
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
 cop is down.

402
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
 It's officer down, officer down.

403
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
 Oh no, what's this canine going to do?

404
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,800
 He checks his pulse.

405
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 He puts a little paw on the guy's wrist.

406
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,280
 He's like, oh no, no, pulse.

407
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,560
 He's down.

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,200
 He's dying.

409
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,080
 My buddy's dying.

410
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,760
 It's kind of cruel now to think about it.

411
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
 Tricking your dog into thinking you're dying.

412
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,520
 The dog then begins to jump up and down on the dude's chest.

413
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,800
 He's giving him CPR.

414
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,840
 He's jumping.

415
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,880
 He's jumping.

416
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,400
 And then the dog nuzzles him with his little snout thingy and like he's giving a mouth to mouth.

417
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
 Isn't that adorable?

418
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
 I am going to get a dog.

419
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,400
 And I'm going to train it to act out every possible life saving scenario.

420
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,160
 I am going to make a paper mache head and have it roll off my body.

421
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,360
 And I'm going to teach my dog to like show it back on.

422
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,040
 And then like unless he succeeds, no treat, no treat.

423
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,880
 Dog, I am going to simulate drowning.

424
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
 I'm going to like bind my hands behind my back.

425
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
 And actually that's incredibly dangerous.

426
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,360
 I'm not going to do that one.

427
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,320
 I will, let's see, how else can I train a dog?

428
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,560
 Oh, I could pretend I could like get some crinkly orange paper and act like there's a fire around

429
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
 me and be like, help me, help me.

430
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,720
 And then train him to get water and throw it on the paper.

431
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,640
 We'll make the paper like great papers so it dissolves.

432
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
 So he'll think he actually put the fire out.

433
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
 And I could just be like pretending to like have really bad food poisoning.

434
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,880
 And the dog will like go buy me some activated charcoal.

435
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,680
 There is so much stuff I could train a dog to do.

436
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,880
 I will actually like find, I'll be walking him along.

437
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,080
 And then I'll just fall down and the dog's like, oh, not again.

438
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,360
 Not again.

439
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
 And it's like trying to feel like what's he trying to do now?

440
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,720
 Is he faking a heart attack?

441
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,160
 He gets stung by a bee.

442
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,120
 Needs an Epi pin.

443
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
 He's like reaching back for the Epi pin.

444
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
 I'm going to put my dog through the ringer.

445
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,360
 I don't have a dog.

446
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,160
 I wish I had a dog.

447
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,240
 Or should I have a puppy?

448
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,280
 I would take any pet though.

449
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,000
 I have plants.

450
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
 Those are my pets because I can't have pets in my place.

451
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
 So I have plants.

452
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,680
 So those are cool, but they can't bring me back to life.

453
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,720
 I don't know, dude.

454
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
 Maybe they're the green plants from...

455
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
 What's that game where you get green plants?

456
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,160
 Resident Evil?

457
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
 Resident Evil?

458
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,120
 Hey, how's that for a turn around?

459
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,280
 I started with video games and ended with video games.

460
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
 That wasn't planned.

461
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,280
 None of this podcast is planned.

462
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
 None of this podcast is planned.

463
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,280
 I read an article and I go, "Oh, that was interesting.

464
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,440
 I will spend 10 minutes talking about that today."

465
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
 So I am having a great time doing this,

466
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,360
 though I hope you are having a great time listening to it.

467
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,040
 We're getting more and more listeners every day.

468
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,680
 I love it.

469
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,720
 I absolutely love it.

470
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,360
 I'm going to go and edit this episode now.

471
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,720
 I hope you have a great day.

472
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,080
 And I got to come up with a tagline.

473
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
 This is like a constant struggle with me.

474
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
 I can't name giant molds.

475
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,560
 We learned that.

476
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
 I didn't name my imaginary dog.

477
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,880
 I'm sure you guys clued in on that.

478
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,720
 You're probably like, "What's he going to name his dog?"

479
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,360
 I don't know.

480
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,640
 I'm really, I mean, you're generally good with names.

481
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,160
 I'm generally good with names, honestly, but I can't name giant mold.

482
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,120
 I can't name my dog and I can't come up with a send off for this show.

483
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,160
 Okay.

484
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
 So now I'm just rambling.

485
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
 So my name is Jason Carpenter.

486
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,960
 Oh, website is there rabbit.com.

487
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,440
 Right now it's pretty much just our blog posting,

488
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,960
 but you can see all of our show notes.

489
