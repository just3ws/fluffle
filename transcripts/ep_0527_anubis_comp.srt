1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The unluckiest man in the world is sitting in a courtroom.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 A miracle drug has a bizarre origin story.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a young woman who believes that her child may actually be a god today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I just pounded my coffee.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 So I don't know how frantic this episode is going to be.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our longtime supporters of the show, Legacy Patreon supporter, Dude No.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Dude No, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 We're putting you back in the captain's seat today.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it. Just help spread the word out about the show.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Sorry, my, just had a weird table that chair shifted underneath me.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 What was in that coffee, bro?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Dude No, let's go ahead and start off in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We're going to take a little trip. We're going to leave behind Oregon and we are headed out to Chandler, Arizona.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Durgible is flying out there. It's August 2020.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So we're going to land at the local courthouse. We're going to walk inside.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And currently sitting on trial is a man named Christopher Wade Nelson. He's 49 years old.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And this defendant has had a horrible life. He's had a horrible life.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 We see him. He's sitting in a wheelchair and he has a voice box attached.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And his defense lawyer is like, "Listen, look at my dude here. Look at my client. It's the term I should use.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Look at my client here. He is obviously in a decline.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 He suffers from Lou Gehrig's disease.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Yes, I do." He says into his voice box.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Defense attorney is like, "He's like, my client cannot serve a day in jail.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 His body is wrecked with this disease. He has two years to live. Five at max.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Bo-ho-ho. Crying noises," his voice box says.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 The judge looks over at the dude. He's sitting in this chair. The judge is just shaking his head.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Normally this would be a very, very sad situation to see someone in.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Normally the judge may feel sympathetic towards this guy.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But the judge knows something. Actually, everyone in the courtroom knows something, except for you.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Because I'm telling you the story this way.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Bo-ho-ho. Teardrop. Teardrop. Teardrop. The voice box says,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 "Christopher Way Nelson has had a string of bad luck in his life.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 He currently has Lou Gehrig's disease. He can't talk. He has a voice box that also emits bodily functions.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Poopy noises now." The defense lawyer is like, "Are you pooping your pants?"

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 "I'm not pooping. I'm pooping my pants."

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "I'm pooping my pants."

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He comes up with this scam. He starts telling people that he has pancreatic cancer.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And they're like, "Oh, that's horrible. Where's the pancreas out on the body? Like, what part hurts?"

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Which is actually not a thing about that. It's not something you should answer at someone with cancer.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 They're like, "Oh, I have bone cancer." You're like, "Which bone, sir?"

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 "Well, you please show me. You shouldn't question them. Well, you should question this guy."

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 He says he has pancreatic cancer and he ends up getting $30,000 from donations and bake sales and stuff like that.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 People were trying to raise money for his treatment of a disease he didn't have.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And then he realized, "Well, I've had pancreas."

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 "I've had pancreas out of cancer for a while."

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "People are starting to kind of figure out that I'm scamming them."

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 "I'll kill myself." That's the answer to all problems, right?

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It's not, but faking killing yourself might be.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 That might solve some problems, especially if people are getting suspicious.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He fakes a suicide.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And then what he does is he starts a new scam.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So he's still alive. He's still in the same town, which would have been really embarrassing if you were walking downtown and someone's like,

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 "Hey, I gave you $1,000 and I thought you killed yourself."

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And you're like, "Uh, you're running away."

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He's still living in the same town, which is super bizarre.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 How did people not see the man with pancreatic cancer who killed himself at the local Walmart?

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But they didn't. Apparently everyone in this town is a dupe.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Because in the same town he starts running a new scam.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 He's like, "Man, that pancreatic cancer was so 2010. I need to get with the times."

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 "What's that ice bucket challenge these kids are always talking about?"

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 "That's it. Luke Gehrig's disease."

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So he starts telling people he has Luke Gehrig's disease in town.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And he actually goes to a repair shop and he's like,

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 "I'm gonna die soon. Can you fix my truck for free?"

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And the guy's like, "Oh, that's horrible. You're gonna die soon. I will totally fix your truck for free."

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And he does.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 He goes, "I want one last ride in this old classic truck before I get a voice box and have to go to court."

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The guy's like, "Why would you go to court?" And he's like, "Ignore that last part."

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 He gets his car fixed for free. He ends up getting a bunch of donations.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 He gets a free motorized scooter. He gets a free voice box.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 He gets all this stuff, which you would need to keep up the ruse.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The second scam nets him about $9,000.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 But at this point people are super suspicious because, one, he killed himself.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 He killed himself in 2015.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Two, he had pancreatic cancer in 2010 that got miraculously cured after he killed himself.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And now he has ALS.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The cops begin looking into him and eventually they do bring him into court for fraud.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And that's when he has this voice box now so he can't testify in his own defense.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And the defense is like, this guy obviously has these medical problems,

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 have mercy, judge, because, yeah, sure, he may have faked his own suicide

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 and may have scammed people out of the pancreatic cancer, but this version, this disease here,

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 this disease is real.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 That other crime he's in trouble for?

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Because that's what they got him for, because people realize he hadn't really died.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He really has Lou Gehrer's disease, but that other one he made up.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So the cops go, well, since he can't speak on his own defense,

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 how about we just play this video tape?

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They put the video tape in and it's him walking around.

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 They had surveillance around his house.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 It's him walking around. He's washing his car.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 At one point in the tape, they didn't show this.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I saw the video of him walking and he was washing his car.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 His truck that got repaired for free because he was going to die.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Now, I'm not saying that if you're going to die, you can't wash your car.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 That's not the cops' proof.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They're like, sir, he only has three months to live.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He has to drive around in a dirty car. That's the law.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 He's also dancing.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I didn't see that clip, so I don't know if it's him just boogying around his pavement.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Also, how bold do you have to be to be scamming a city and then wash your car in public?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 This guy must have just figured he would never get caught.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 But anyways, there's video of him dancing, which again, I don't know if he's at a nightclub

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 doing some Saturday Night Live moves or if he's just kind of bobbing along to music.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It doesn't really matter how well choreographed it is.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The fact is, he said that he couldn't move and he needed a voice box.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Again, people with voice boxes can dance.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I'm putting a lot of limitations on people here.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I'm like, listen, if you have Lou Gehr's disease, you better drive around a dirty car.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And if you have a voice box, you better not get down when that funk starts playing.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm not saying any of that stuff.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I'm just saying that this guy is allegedly a total fraud and he's currently on trial for that.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So now we're on our way out.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Dude, no.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Hey, dude.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Dude.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So I'm nudging him.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I dare you to go steal that dude.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I dare you to go steal his motorized scooter.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Just prove that he's faking.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So dude, no, Sneak 70 grabs it.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And of course, the defendant jumps up on both feet and says, "Come back here with that."

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And we drive away on it.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And now we have a new vehicle.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's Christopher's.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 The vehicle is called Christopher's Motorized Scooter.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 We are going to take this scooter out into the city streets of Chandler, Arizona, the most

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 callable city in the United States.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 How do you run two scams, die during one of them, and still get away with it?

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I don't know.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 But we're taking off on this dude's motorized scooter.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We are going to drive it.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 We're going to have to ditch it at some point because the cops are looking for us.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 We stole it out of a courthouse.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 No matter if this guy is a fraud, allegedly, again, a fraud, the courthouse going on.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 We still stole evidence from a trial.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Go, go, go, go, go.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Motorized scooter is going down the road.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 As we're going down the road, I want to talk about this story.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I've actually had it in my notes for a long time, and I still don't really understand it.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 There may be signs behind it where you guys go.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I don't know.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 That's totally normal.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 But we're driving down and we're going to go to a research facility.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We're going to burn the motorized scooter.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Other than the 50 witnesses that saw us steal it out of the courtroom.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 We're walking into this medical laboratory.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 We're putting on our lab coats.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 We're walking in, grabbing clipboards from real scientists, and we're scribbling on their notes.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We handed back to them.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 They're fixed it for you.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So we walk into this laboratory, and they're currently working on this new drug called isovoline.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We see the scientists studying something.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 We don't really see what it is, but we see all these little vials and stuff like that.

166
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I'm daring you to drink it.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Come on, drink it, drink it.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Maybe you'll get superpowers.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Isovoline basically is a non-sedating pain blocker.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And the reason why doctors needed this thing is one of the biggest complications with surgery

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 is figuring out the right dosage of painkiller.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Because you not only have to sedate the patient, but you also have to dull the pain or hopefully make it go away.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So they're taking stuff called propiful, which is an anaesthetic, which is an anaest--

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 You know, this stuff that knocks you out, right?

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And it doesn't matter.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 It doesn't matter.

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 You know what it is.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And then they have to give them opioids, and if you get the measurements wrong, you kill them.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 They say like one of the leading causes of malpractice suits is this measurement going wrong

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 and people dying or having horrible complications and things like that.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Isovoline, it's actually an amino acid.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 When they use it on mice, they do this thing called the clip test, where they'll attach a little metal clip to their tail.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 That's how they test pain receptors, painkillers.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Mouse is totally fine with it.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Not only is that-- I mean, it's not going to go out to the club with it on, but it doesn't really--

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 The pain doesn't bug them.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Not only that, it doesn't put them under.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It's a non-sedating pain agent.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It doesn't get you high.

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 It doesn't-- You're like, "Oh, you're shutting off the podcast?"

191
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 You're like, "Dang it."

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It doesn't get you high, which is great for pain relief, because the problem with opioids, they can be abused because they do get you high.

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It blocks your pain.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It doesn't get you high.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 It doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, so you don't have any sort of mental problems with it.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It doesn't upset your stomach like ibuprofen.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's super cheap to produce, and it alleviates pain.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But, here's the big but.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 This is really interesting about it, because I have pain.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 You know, I have back pain and stuff like that.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I'm older.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 My knees hurt.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It would be neat to be prescribed, or even over the counter would be even better, but a pain medication that actually blocks the pain.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I wake up every morning, and I take ibuprofen and Tylenol, and then I have to take a break from them for a while.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 But, as much as a miracle drug as this sounds, there's 20 amino acids that are natural on Earth.

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 This isn't one of them.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 That's when we see the scientists who are in the lab who are kind of blocking something from our view earlier on, and they move away.

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's a meteorite.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 This amino acid was completely unknown to mankind until 1969, when a meteorite crash-landed in Australia.

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And when they began analyzing it, they found an amino acid that does not naturally occur on this planet.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Isobalane.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 They now that they know it exists, they can replicate it.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But it's from space.

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Would you be willing to take something that did not naturally ever occur on this planet?

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Nobody knew it existed until 1969.

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And you could say, "Well, Jason, plastics."

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 But even plastics is from oil.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 We're taking something that's naturally occurring, and making something that's not very naturally occurring.

219
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This is 100% from space.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The science community goes, "This is cool, because it's a painkiller."

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 But also, it kind of proves to us the idea that life may have been seeded on planets from meteorites.

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 If one of these meteorites had landed into an empty ocean billions of years ago, it would have been one of the building blocks of life.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 But it wasn't.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The other amino acids were, but this one is not naturally occurring on Earth.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Would you want to be injected with an alien amino acid?

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The definition of alien.

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And this is why I waited so long on the story.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I'm sure a science dude could be like, "Well, no, Jason, amino acids are just like these chains that we can fix, so it's not really from space.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It's just a different combination."

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And that may be the case, but still.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'm going to dismiss that argument.

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I think of this as something that doesn't occur naturally on Earth.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 That's from space.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I don't know if I would take that drug.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 As much as I have to deal with back pain.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I don't know if I would take a drug from space to cure it.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It almost seems like a miracle drug.

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Something that could override pain and not get you high.

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Just make your body feel like it felt when you were 15, when you didn't have any pain.

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's possible that this drug is totally normal and it will be the future of pain medication.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 It's also possible that it's the future of pain medication.

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 But over time, this alien amino acid begins to have long-term effects on the human body.

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So would you take a drug that has all the pluses of pain relief, none of the negatives?

244
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You can't get addicted to it.

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 You can still drive on it.

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 You're a functioning member of society, even more functioning now because you no longer have pain.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 But that miracle drug came from the depths of space.

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 You could say Jason will all amino acids at some point really came from space.

249
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 That's the point.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 They all landed here in meteorites.

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Sure, but they've been here for billions of years.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 This one has only been here for about 40-something years.

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 It's a little bit older than I am.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I think I'd be more willing to take another laboratory built pain killer that may have negative effects in the long run.

255
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Then take an alien amino acid to cure my pain.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I mean, I basically, because that's how the blob started, right?

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Okay, no one was snorting the blob that they would have if he was in powder form.

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 They totally would have eaten the blob if the dude had a spoon.

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But basically, this is the problem with pop culture, right?

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 People go, "Hey, we want to build this robot.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It'll help with farming."

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And everyone goes, "Ah, I saw the Terminator."

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Basically, science is going to be like, "Hey, we have this miracle drug.

264
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It'll solve your pain."

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And I was like, "Nope, saw the blob.

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Saw the blob.

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I'm just going to walk around with a bad back for the rest of my life,

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 taking Tylenol and ibuprofen and hurting my stomach and my liver because I saw the blob."

269
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I'm going to get a shirt that just says, "I saw the blob."

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And then there's a picture of a meteorite with an X through it.

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And people are like, "Jason, what's up with your weird shirts you're always wearing around?"

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 But if they only knew the truth, if they only knew the truth of the movie, the blob,

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 they would understand why I have a life of back pain because I don't want to get eaten by the blob.

274
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 That's why.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 "Hey, why are you walking with that cane?

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Everyone else is taking this drug."

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And I'm like, "Just give it another 10 years, young whippersnapper.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It's going to be blobs.

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Blobs everywhere because you're eating that amino acid."

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Dude, no.

281
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Let's call in that carbonar copter, that legendary vehicle.

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We are taking off.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 We are leaving behind the scientific lab and we are headed out to a small house in the middle of any town, USA.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 [imitates car noises]

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 We land at this house and we walk around the back of the house.

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I love these intros.

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I'm sorry, but I do.

288
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 We walk around the back of the house because we want to look in the rear window.

289
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection is available now in a 4K Ultra HD combo pack with a Blu-ray and digital code from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 The collection includes for the very first time the original, never-released, uncut version of Psycho.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Universally recognizes the master of suspense, the legendary Alfred Hitchcock directed some of cinema's most thrilling and unforgettable classics.

292
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 The collection includes four iconic films from the acclaimed director's illustrious career, including Rare Window, Vertigo, Psycho and the Birds, and stunning 4K resolution.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Starring Hollywood favorites such as James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Anthony Perkins, Janet Lee, Tippi Hedgerin, Kim Novak, and Rob Taylor, this essential collection features hours of bonus features, as well as the original, uncut version of Psycho for the first time ever.

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 This collection with collectible disc book packaging includes hours of bonus features, such as documentaries, expert commentaries, interviews, screen tests, and much, much more.

295
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I said that a little too loudly.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I said that a little too loudly in the backyard of this house.

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Neighbors are kind of peeking over.

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 We have to hide in the bushes.

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But after they're done peeking, we're going to stay here until the sun sets.

300
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 It's nighttime now.

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We're sitting in this house.

302
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Now, this story took place in 1976.

303
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I actually got this from that website called ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 We don't have a location.

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 We don't have an exact date.

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We have no date, actually.

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 This was also reported in a newsletter called Encounters with the Unknown by a group known as UFO CCI, which is a UFO research group.

308
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 We're going to meet a young woman.

309
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We're going to call her Samantha.

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And she's sleeping in bed.

311
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's a normal night.

312
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Nothing unusual has happened so far.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But in the middle of the night, she wakes up.

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Now, she describes it as a dream-like state.

315
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Now, normally, we would dismiss this story as a dream until what follows actually happens.

316
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 She goes to bed.

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 She's now in a dream-like state.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 She's laying on a table.

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 She's no longer in her bedroom.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The first thing she notices is that her legs are in the air.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And they're on the shoulder of a man, a man she's never seen before.

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He's standing between her legs.

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Now, using the term "man" is a bit of a misnomer, because this is basically some sort of monster.

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 She's terrified of it at first.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And she's terrified at the end of the story, too.

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But what she sees is something with the body of a man with pale, almost pinkish skin.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But its head is that of a dog with long pointed ears, a long brown snout.

328
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 She's on this table.

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 She's seen this creature stand between her legs.

330
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And her ankles are up on its shoulders.

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 She knows what's coming next.

332
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 This creature is totally naked in front of her.

333
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 She notices this creature has red stripes on his pink skin.

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And the red stripes actually continue on to his genitals.

335
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 She asks what's going on.

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 What's going on?

337
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 She knows what's going on, but you almost have this instinctual thing, even if you know the answer.

338
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But she says when she asked it, she felt utter fear wash over her.

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And this creature with this dog head stared at her.

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 She said she felt like she couldn't look away from its eyes.

341
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And as she's looking at this dog creature's eyes, they begin to spin, like pinwheels.

342
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 The eyes just begin rotating around, hypnotizing her.

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 The fear becomes even worse at this point as she feels these eyes destroying her mind.

344
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 The next thing she knows she's back in bed, her heart is pounding.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 A horrible nightmare.

346
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 A horrible nightmare.

347
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 A month later though, she finds out she's pregnant.

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Now we don't know this woman's sexual history.

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 She may have had a lover at the time.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 There's no notice in this story saying that she hadn't had sex in a long time or anything like that.

351
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So she may be chalking the dream up to something else in the pregnancy to an earthly lover.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But she begins to see sparkles around her.

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 [Makes noises]

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Sometimes they're in the corner of her eye, but sometimes when she's just sitting in the room, she'd see cracks of light.

355
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 [Makes noises]

356
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 She gave them intent.

357
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 She actually said they felt like they were nosy.

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 These weren't just visual images.

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 She felt like they were watching her back, just crackling light.

360
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And these visual disturbances, these lights, were there for her entire pregnancy.

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 She eventually gives birth to a baby boy she named Tony.

362
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 After she gives birth, she said when she first held her son, the entire room crackled with energy.

363
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 She saw white flashes of light like she had always seen, but now she's also seen electric blue flashes and gold flashes.

364
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 They're almost covering up her vision.

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They're so disturbing to her for the first time she asks other people can see these things.

366
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 They're blinding to her.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Doctors have no idea what she's talking about.

368
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 The visual disturbances stop and the boy is a healthy baby boy.

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The whole pregnancy was healthy.

370
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 There's no complications there.

371
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 In 1988, Samantha is looking through a copy of a Time Life Mysteries book.

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And that was the first time she saw a picture of the Egyptian god Anubis.

373
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And she immediately recognizes it as the creature she saw in her dream.

374
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 What's funny is nowadays, with the internet, you're going to stumble across images of all sorts of things.

375
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But back then in '88, like, you could go your entire life without ever seeing a picture of Anubis.

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 It was a different time period. I know there may be people going, "Well, she dreamt about Anubis."

377
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 She obviously had seen that image before.

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Pre-internet, you were limited to what books you had on hand. It was a very, very weird time.

379
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Knowledge, it was, they call it the information age for a reason.

380
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You can literally go back to a time before the internet.

381
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Your knowledge was limited to basically four television channels and the books you had access to.

382
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But she could have gone her entire life without ever looking up Egyptian mythology.

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 She could probably recognize a picture of Zeus. They taught that stuff in school.

384
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Not that it was true, but I remember Greek mythology was taught in our school because there was all these tales at kids like.

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 She realizes that's who she saw that night.

386
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But to make things even creepier, her son, who at this point would have been eight, nine years old, sees the picture as well.

387
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And Tony tells his mother, "I've seen him before. I have a dream. I have it often, where I'm walking by myself and I see a pyramid before me.

388
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And I'm drawn into the pyramid. I go into its depths and I see these images on the walls.

389
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 One of them is that guy. Every time I have this dream, it's the same.

390
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 I walk into this room and the image walks off the wall. A man with the head of a dog.

391
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And he walks up to me and he begins to teach me things."

392
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Now the mom had never told her son about this encounter before.

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 She asked Tony, "What does he say to you?" And Tony answers, "I don't remember.

394
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 But every time I have this dream, he comes off the wall and he talks to me.

395
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But when I wake up, I can never remember what he said."

396
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 A skeptic could tear this story apart, obviously, right?

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 That she had seen a picture of Anubis before, that the kid had seen a picture of Anubis, that she had told her son the story.

398
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 We don't know those details. We don't know those details. It could be completely made up. That's fine.

399
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps for a while, because that's an interesting story.

400
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 It has the hallmarks of a normal alien abduction.

401
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 But alien abductions very rarely. I'm trying to think of another example where they involve mythology like this.

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I know there's always been stories that the gods of old were actually visitations from aliens.

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And that's why they have these stories about these people coming down from the skies.

404
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 But in modern UFOology, I can't come across the story where people met Zeus on a UFO.

405
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 That's what this story is kind of similar to.

406
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Let's assume the story is true. That she had this dream that turned out to be something else, and her son is visited by Anubis.

407
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 This kid would be my age today. Tony would be my age today.

408
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And it's possible he's still out there. It's possible he's still alive.

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Some of us feel like we're protected by a guardian angel. He may have a guardian god standing behind him.

410
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 He's the sire of an ancient being who's alive today.

411
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 You have to wonder how his mom raised him after hearing that story.

412
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Did she treat him as if he was the descendant of an Egyptian god?

413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I mean, do they have to do chores at that point? Right?

414
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 It's a creepy story to think of in that point of view.

415
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You'd have a kid, a man at this point named Tony, who would be 43, 44, somewhere around there, who's still alive walking the earth.

416
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 A descendant of a god, alive now.

417
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 But not just any god. Anubis was the god of the underworld, the god of wandering souls, who modern religion would equate with the devil.

418
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Now, I know Egyptian mythology may be a little more nuanced than god-devil, but that is what he would be associated with in modern parlance.

419
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So it's possible that we actually have the name of the Antichrist.

420
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 He's alive today. His name is Tony. His very unassuming name.

421
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Because that is the name that... We don't have the woman's name, but she does give the boy's name as Tony, his real name.

422
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And the name Tony means triumphant.

423
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 There's always been a lot of talk about the Antichrist being alive in modern times.

424
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And while I'm not saying we should hunt down every Tony on the planet, Tony the Tiger's like, "Ah, you should be a little more cautious around people with that name in that age range."

425
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Because that employee that you're yelling at, or that car you're speeding past, flipping off the bird to the man with the license plate that says Tony won,

426
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 that man might actually be a direct descendant of an ancient god.

427
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 He may at this very moment be planning to make the first move in the war against the living.

428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 The story of the Antichrist could just be a misinterpreted story in modern religion.

429
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Or it could be a literal person who is going to initiate the final war of this reality.

430
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 We won't know until we hear that first trumpet.

431
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 We won't know until the furnace of hell is lit and the gates of heaven break open.

432
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And the final war in this reality begins.

433
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And by then it will be too late to pick a side.

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 You can choose the side of the angels and lay down your life, or you can choose to side with Tony, think some guy named Tony,

435
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 the Legion of Darkness that is attempting to take over all that is.

436
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Or you may not have a choice.

437
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Just before that first trumpet blows and the war starts, you could be lying in bed asleep,

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 comforted that everything will be okay when you wake up.

439
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 But that night while you're dreaming, that night while millions of people are dreaming,

440
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 they are all visited by a man with the head of a dog.

441
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You try to resist its orders and its eyes begin to spin.

442
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 You may have always thought of yourself joining the side of good in the final conflict.

443
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 You wanted to fight for what was right.

444
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But instead you are another mindless slave of the Dark God of the Underworld.
