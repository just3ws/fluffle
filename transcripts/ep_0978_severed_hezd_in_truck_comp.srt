1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Is it possible for a ghost to be so powerful they can make you cease to exist?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,940
 Then we hop aboard a school bus to take a look at a bizarre experience of a seventh grader.

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,200
 One day while riding home on the school bus they looked out the window and saw something

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 that defies explanation. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:41,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,400
 Carpenter, and I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,520
 a ton of stuff to cover, so we gotta get started right away. First off, walking into Dead Rabbit

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,560
 Man is one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Everyone get on your feet and give a big round

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,800
 of applause for SE. Woohoo! Yeah, come on in buddy. Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command,

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,680
 do a little fancy spin. Cause you're a show off SE, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,600
 This episode if you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand, I do. Just

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,800
 help spread the word about this show that really, really, really helps out a lot. Now,

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,280
 we have a ton of stuff to cover, but I do have to give a little bit of announcements.

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,960
 First off, this is the end of season 19. This week is the end of season 19. After this,

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,800
 I'm going to take a break until December 1st. However, I invite all of you guys to join

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,440
 me on November 24th, that is a Thanksgiving November 24th at 12pm Pacific Standard Time

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,440
 for the annual Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving livestream. Meet us over on YouTube. This

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,480
 is the reason why I stopped posting on YouTube, because they were getting ready to take the

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,000
 channel down, because they hate the podcast, but I wanted to be able to keep doing these

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 livestreams and the YouTube shorts and all that stuff. And so I really would appreciate

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,600
 if you guys came out here and spent, you know, with your family, spent it with us. Now I'm

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,160
 putting it early enough in the day that I think most people could join us. And if not,

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,840
 it really is just, you know, I know how lonely the holidays gets. So I thought it would be

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,080
 really cool for us to hang out together. If you can't make it, that's totally fine.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
 But check us out on the YouTube channel. I'll put the link, the YouTube link in the show

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,760
 notes November 24th, 2022. Cholpia Pacific Standard Time, Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,880
 livestream special. If you guys can't be there, totally understand you'll be there in spirit.

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,480
 Whether you want to or not, I'm going to reach through the astral world and suck your souls

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,960
 into this livestream. Your relatives are like, Hey, why are you so quiet? Why are you just

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,040
 standing around in the corner of the room? It's Thanksgiving. Come and have a seat. You

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,120
 can't. Your soul belongs to me. S E. Let's go ahead. That's some threatening. I'm mildly

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,320
 threatening actually. It's not more than mildly threatening. S E. Let's go ahead and toss

33
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,600
 you the hair hang glider. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, jump off the highest

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:11,280
 point and glide us all the way out to a shopping mall. I saw a movie the other day called Hex.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,840
 It was about a haunted, I don't even know how anyone would come up with this topic. It was

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,440
 a movie about these parachuter people. What are they called? Skydivers. And they're like,

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,720
 I'm probably should just get started with the other side. I'm actually not feeling that

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,640
 well. But let's just prolong the episode a little bit. This is the last of the week.

39
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:41,880
 I watched this movie recently about these haunted skydivers. They were, this is fantastic,

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,480
 this is a fantastic plot. The movie wasn't very good, but it was about these skydivers

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,280
 who they're like, they meet this new girl, they find this new skydiving girl. They're

42
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,840
 like, you dive alone. And she's like, yeah, I've always dived alone since my dad died

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,000
 skydiving or something like that. And they go, well, you know, I'd quit being such a

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,880
 poor dad's dad. Why don't you come and join us as we go skydiving? Let's do this. And

45
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,920
 so she goes skydiving with them and they said, you know what we should do now that we have

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,480
 six people in our skydiving group, we should do the hex. People are like, Oh, no, not the

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:28,040
 hex. And the hex is a, it's a sky, it's not real. I don't think so. I'm kind of scared.

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:36,320
 It's it takes six people. It's a haunted skydiving maneuver. So they're like, dude, let's do the

49
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
 hex. It'll be so cool. And people will be like, you can't do the hex. Every time someone

50
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,640
 does the hex, they die. And not because it's so difficult because it's like magical, because

51
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,200
 it's this magical cursed parachuting maneuver. And it's so funny. So they all go up in this

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,840
 airplane. You can tell basically what the movie was. It was very well made. Like, like

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,680
 cinematography was good. They had really good cameras and stuff like that. But you can tell

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,800
 it was basically someone owned someone owned a skydiving school. And they said, Hey, let's

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,680
 make a horror movie that takes place in broad daylight, 10,000 feet in the air. And so they

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,600
 do the hex. And like one guy's in the middle, one guy's in the middle of this circle of

57
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,880
 people. And they're falling. Then all of a sudden, he dematerializes. He just disappears

58
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 in front of them. And they're like, Randy, no, Randy, where'd you go? And they still

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
 have to fall like another 9,000 feet, right? You see this guy simply ceased to exist in

60
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,160
 front of you. And they all land. And then the movie I was like, what in the world? They're

61
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,360
 like, where did Randy go? Where did Randy go? Did he pull a shoot early? No, he dematerialized.

62
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,240
 You were looking right at him. He just disappeared. He stopped existing. They're like, maybe he

63
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,280
 pulled a shoot. Well, then where is he? Well, maybe his shoot failed. And then they get

64
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,160
 investigated by the police. And they're like, you got to find a friend, Randy, man, he's

65
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,160
 missing. You must like parachuted away. He must have had one of those new dematerializing

66
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,440
 parachutes that the predator sold them. They go to the police and the police are investigating

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
 it. And they're like, you kids are crazy. You just can't disappear in the thin air literally

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,720
 because the air is thin up there. And they're like, no, Randy's gone. And they're like, are

69
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,560
 you sure about that? And then they see the helmet can footage of them parachuting down.

70
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,000
 And there was only five people up there. So Randy never existed. Or something like that.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,160
 I'm not fully aware. That was when I kind of started checking out. I was like, I don't

72
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,400
 know about this movie. And then the movie kept going on and on. And then spoiler alert in

73
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,080
 case you're planning on watching hex, it turned out that there is so funny. I just need to

74
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,560
 get started with the episode. But I want to tell someone about this movie. No one that

75
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,600
 I know wants to hear me talk about hex. So I'm making you, it turns out that a parachute

76
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:08,040
 person like a master skydiver made a deal with the devil. And the devil gave him a

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,240
 cursed altometer. And the thing that tells how high you are, the devil gave him a cursed

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:27,040
 altometer. And this device makes the old grizzled skydiving coach immortal. You can't die, which

79
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,840
 would probably be pretty, probably be a pretty neat trick if you were skydiving all the time,

80
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,720
 like not releasing your parachute at all. You're like, people are like, Oh my God, Joe,

81
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
 you're gonna die. And then he hits the ground. There's like a puff of smoke from a roadrunner

82
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,880
 cartoon. And then you get down there and he's like tea anybody. No, you just fell 30,000

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,920
 feet and you didn't open your parachute. It'd be pretty, it would be a great skill for a

84
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:58,040
 skydiver. It also be super suspicious. When you're like, I'm never done all this crazy

85
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,640
 stuff. He's landing on his head intentionally. He's like, you're like, what? Let me see your

86
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,400
 altometer. Is it cursed? And then it had something to do with the girl. Like the entire movie

87
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,200
 took place in a comp... This was interesting. I never... I'm talking about it once I get

88
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,320
 to the interesting part. I got bored. I was like, the whole movie took place like in three

89
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,040
 minutes or something like that. It was kind of an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge. She was

90
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,080
 trapped. She died in the plane crash. They didn't even get to do the hex. The plane crashed

91
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,840
 or blew up or something like that. And I don't know. I lost interest somewhere in between

92
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,080
 the guy dematerializing. And then at the ending, the bad guy had this cursed altometer and

93
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,960
 the devil was driving the car. Not like a really cool CGI devil. Just a guy in a black

94
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,960
 suit. They're driving around. They're doing donuts in the desert. Somewhere in between.

95
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,520
 Somewhere in between. That was the final shot of the devil. It was like a favorite dream.

96
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,360
 Maybe this movie doesn't exist. Maybe I'm Randy. The devil's driving... I just got to

97
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,400
 get started with the episode. The devil's driving the car at the ending. And then about

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,920
 20 minutes in is when that dude dematerializes. The whole movie, I guess, takes place in like

99
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,200
 a three minute time period. The girl trying to solve the mystery as to where Randy went

100
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,600
 and how to uncurse the hex. How to get rid of the cur... Whatever. Whatever. I'm just

101
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,920
 talking about it. And now I realize it was interesting but it's kind of complicated to

102
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:37,240
 talk about. Anyways, I saw that movie so thank you for... Thanks for letting me talk about

103
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,320
 it. Nobody else wants to hear about that movie. I figured you might like it.

104
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,280
 S.C. go ahead and land this... Dead Red Rapper finally getting started with the episode. S.C.

105
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,400
 go ahead and land this hair hang glider in the parking lot of this shopping mall. We're

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,320
 right outside a Sears department store. We're going to walk on into it. Now, we don't have

107
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,480
 a location for this story. This is one of the stories where we don't have a location.

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,640
 We don't have a time period. We don't even have the name of the person. The person posted

109
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,840
 this anonymously. We're going to call him Sam. But if this story is true, this is a pretty

110
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:19,360
 insane paranormal event. Sam, who uses the online name "Fordor II Seater." Sam used to

111
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,840
 work at a mall photo studio. You know those places you used to go to to get your picture

112
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,120
 taken before every single person had a phone in their pocket? You'd go in there and get

113
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,920
 your photo taken. That's how it used to be back in the day. Sam used to work at one of

114
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:41,720
 these places. When Sam is working there, he's told pretty early on that the place is haunted.

115
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,560
 Sam says that this photo studio was set up... There was only really two main rooms to it.

116
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,320
 You had these two rooms. You had about seven different backdrops. You would go in there

117
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
 and be like, "Hey, you're going to go take a photo for your grandma. Let's make it look

118
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,480
 like you're in Maui." Obviously, your grandma's a huge idiot. You can't tell the difference

119
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,640
 between Maui and a backdrop at a mall photo center. You're pulling these backdrops down.

120
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,240
 A lot of people go in here to take photos of their kids. You bring your kid in and there's

121
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,360
 toys and stuff to animals that you can place around them. The baby's like, "Ah, click."

122
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,200
 Then there you go. Send that to grandma. You're like, "What? I know the baby was in Maui."

123
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,360
 That was about it. It was fairly small. You also had a room in the back where they developed

124
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,400
 the film. Actually, I'm thinking about it. The story's probably pre-Mid 2000s. I'm going

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,080
 to guess somewhere between the 90s and the 2000s is when the story takes place. They've

126
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,760
 developed the photos in their ... I don't know if this story could take place yesterday

127
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,000
 in Alabama, but you have the photos taken and developed there while you wait. Maybe

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,680
 you could go get a churro and an orange julie and swing back by, but you could leave with

129
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,360
 the photos that were taken. Basic place. These were around all the time when I was a kid

130
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,080
 and a young adult.

131
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,720
 Sam was told this place was haunted. Sam did realize it pretty quickly that, "Yeah, this

132
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,840
 place is haunted." Very, very by-the-book paranormal activity. There was no missing

133
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:24,040
 skydivers. It was just stuff ... I swear that I left this toy tiger in room A, but it's

134
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,560
 weird. When I went to room B, the toy tiger was sitting in there. You'd have toys move

135
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,280
 from room to room or ... that's weird. I remember we used the Maui backdrop for the last photo

136
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,000
 in room A, but then when I came back later, there was a different backdrop set up. Interesting.

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,440
 Now you could account that for the fact that people are constantly changing backdrops.

138
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,240
 There's kids there. Stuff's going to move from room to room. It would be easy to dismiss

139
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,360
 if you were a skeptic, but if you were working there and you knew you were the only one there

140
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,560
 or it was just you and somebody else and they weren't in the room in that time period and

141
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,120
 stuff was moving from room to room, it would also be easy to chalk up to paranormal activity.

142
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,680
 This would be easy for both a skeptic and a believer in the paranormal to kind of get

143
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,920
 an argument over, right? Because it's stuff that could easily happen with human interaction

144
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,640
 and you not realizing it. A customer changing the backdrop, a kid carrying the toy from

145
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,720
 one room to another, but if you believed in the paranormal, you could go and like, "No,

146
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,280
 this stuff was happening when there was no one else in the building. No one else was

147
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,760
 changing the stuff." But fairly basic. Fairly, fairly basic things. Also, again, this is

148
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,560
 a staple of paranormal activity. Lights would turn on in rooms where there was nobody.

149
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,840
 Malfunctioning lights. You could chalk it up to stuff like that. Very, very standard stuff.

150
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,840
 Except for what I'm about to tell you. I actually was messaging four door two-seater

151
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,680
 online. I've never seen anything like this. I couldn't think of anything like this. In

152
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,760
 the realm of ghosts at least. Let's take a look at this. It's fascinating. 20 minutes

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,640
 into the episode, let's get started. Sam and his manager were working at the photo studio

154
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,360
 one day when a teenage girl walks in and she needs to get a passport photo taken. Pretty

155
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,440
 basic stuff. You take a bunch of photos, select the best one, make five copies of it, hand

156
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,720
 it to the customer. Good to go. So they do that. The girl comes in, they put her on a

157
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,600
 stool, they have their basic backdrop, and 12 photographs are taken from about a few

158
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:39,240
 feet away. Click, click, click. I'm not gonna do 12 times. Multiply that by 4. And then

159
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,800
 it's time to develop them. Hey, young lady, why don't you go get a churro and an orange

160
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:51,040
 Julius while we develop these pictures? So Sam and the manager go into the back room,

161
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,480
 the dark room. Spooky is placed to be. Spooky is placed to be in a haunted photo studio.

162
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:04,760
 They're in the dark room to develop these photographs. And all of a sudden Sam hears

163
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:13,160
 his manager gasp. He turns to her and goes, "What? What's wrong?" And the manager hands

164
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:24,340
 the negatives, the film negatives over to Sam. Photo one is a picture of this girl sitting

165
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,280
 on a stool, the teenage girl, not like a spooky Annabelle girl. That's the first photo. Totally

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,040
 normal. That's exactly what Sam had expected it to look like. Second photo looks the same.

167
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,480
 Third photo looks the same. Variations in her facial expression, maybe her shoulders

168
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,240
 are a little slump. This is why they take 12 of them, right? The first 7 photos are

169
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,320
 of the young girl sitting on the stool. But Sam's continuing to look at these negatives

170
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:11,800
 and photo 8, 9 and 10, the girl is gone. In the photograph is just the wooden stool. Photo

171
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:24,720
 11, teenage girl sitting on a stool. Photo 12, teenage girl sitting on a stool. When Sam

172
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,320
 posted this, he does address the possibility that it could be a malfunction in the camera,

173
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,520
 but what would be the malfunction? What would be the malfunction? I could understand if

174
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:44,160
 the photo was blurry or if a photo wasn't taken at all. Like obviously you need time

175
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:52,520
 to get a new camera, but the photo is there, everything is there, but the girl. And then

176
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,600
 you could say it was a glitch because the remaining photos didn't have the girl. But

177
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,880
 there was 3 times that click happened where something was photographed. Well it's funny,

178
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,080
 I was about to say that wasn't there, but that's almost a misnomer. When we talk about

179
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,640
 ghostly photographs, normally what they are is someone takes a photograph of a hallway

180
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,240
 and then when the film is developed or when you look at your phone on your screen, there's

181
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,000
 something in the photo that wasn't there before. That's what common ghost photography

182
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,680
 is. I can't think of a time, and maybe you guys can correct me, I can't think of a time

183
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,720
 where a photograph was taken of something that was there that you could see with the

184
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,120
 naked eye, that was a normal object. You're looking at a chair, an old antique chair at

185
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,720
 a Goodwill and you want to send a photo to somebody, you take a picture of the chair,

186
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,840
 but then when you look at the photograph, everything else, everything else in that Goodwill

187
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,680
 is in the photograph except for the chair. And it's not that the chair is distorted,

188
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,640
 it's not like there's something blurry that's been added to the photograph, what you're

189
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,040
 seeing is something removed from the photograph that existed in reality. I can't think of

190
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,880
 another time that that's happened. And again, let me clarify this too, I'm not talking about

191
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,720
 a time where we have a story of somebody seeing a ghost walking down a hallway, taking a photograph

192
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,480
 of the photograph not appearing correctly. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about

193
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,960
 you see your mom walking down the hallway, not a ghost mom, a real mom, and you take

194
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,360
 a photograph of her and then when you look at the photograph later, it's just an empty

195
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,440
 hallway. Because that's what this seems to be. When I was talking to Sam online, they

196
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,240
 seemed to throw out the possibility that maybe the teenage girl was a ghost, maybe she was

197
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,640
 a ghost all along. I've never seen anything like that. I've never seen something where

198
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,480
 two witnesses, right, are seeing something with their own eyeballs that should be real.

199
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,000
 Again, it's not like two people see a UFO in the sky and they take a photograph and you

200
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
 can't see the UFO in the photograph. I'm not talking about, because we know that that's

201
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:21,120
 already a bizarre event. This is just somebody walking in to get their photo taken and then

202
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
 they cease to exist and then they come back. There's actually so many different layers

203
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
 to this. It's not like they simply cease to be in them and they walked out. She had never

204
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,920
 been there before because actually when I was talking to Sam about this online, one of

205
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,320
 their theories was that she was a ghost or the ghost of the photo store, which I think

206
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,480
 you could argue is possible. I didn't really go that direction because she showed back

207
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
 up in the photographs and they also gave her the photographs and they gave her copies

208
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,440
 of the photographs and she left. She left the story. She didn't dematerialize and the

209
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,040
 photographs fall on the ground. She probably did go to Orange Julius. She probably did

210
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,040
 get a delicious treat. I can't think of a time where someone's dematerialized in a photo

211
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,520
 session. Now to be fair, we haven't covered a lot of photo sessions on this podcast or

212
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:16,320
 even in my independent research, but what I think happened, what my theory is, is that

213
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:31,920
 what was ever in that film studio was so powerful it could manipulate the technology at the

214
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,880
 very least. It was so powerful that you could take a photo of something that exists, not

215
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,200
 something imaginary, not something that could be a trick of the light because it happens

216
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,640
 all the time in the world of paranormal. You think you see something walking down a hallway,

217
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,720
 take a photograph, you look at the photograph, the hallway's empty. That's normal. This is

218
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,320
 a situation of your mom walking down the hallway, you're taking a photograph, you look at the

219
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,520
 camera, it's an empty hallway. Your mom doesn't jump, she's right in your face. Time for dinner!

220
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,740
 That's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. Something real that

221
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:09,000
 ceased to exist for a couple moments in time and then it started existing again. So fascinating.

222
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,320
 I thought if it was my theory, again the story also could totally be made up, but my theory

223
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,520
 is that the ghost at the very least manipulated the technology of the camera to make the person

224
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,840
 cease to exist for three frames of film. And the reason why they would do that is almost

225
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,300
 as a flex to do it to show that they had that ability. The manager also said she had never

226
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,100
 seen anything like this before. She's never seen a glitch like this or even any haunting

227
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,020
 activity like this. So it would have been an ability for the ghost to show how powerful

228
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,340
 it was. That's theory one. Theory number two is actually far more disturbing and if it

229
00:21:51,340 --> 00:22:02,920
 is true, this would rank as one of the most powerful ghosts on record. Because what is

230
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,640
 possible is as they were taking the photographs of this girl, the ghost literally made her

231
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 disappear. It wasn't that she was blinked out of reality in the photographs, it was that

232
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:22,960
 the ghost made her blink out of reality in real life. Which would take a tremendous amount

233
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,580
 of energy. At that point, we're not talking about a ghost, we're talking about alien powers

234
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,380
 at that point. Aliens can dematerialize people and rematerialize people and things like that.

235
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,780
 That's what we see in the lore. They can also materialize and dematerialize themselves.

236
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,400
 But I can't think of a time. We do cover stories of people dematerializing. That's what a lot

237
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,560
 of missing 411 is. It's a kid walking around a berry bush and then they never see him again.

238
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,080
 Missing 411, although paranormal, never gets tied into the world of ghosts. There are pretty

239
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,760
 firm power limits on the way we describe ghosts. The fact that a ghost could dematerialize and

240
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:16,860
 then rematerialize somebody. You would almost need a haunted skydiving technique to do that.

241
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,900
 Fascinating story. I wish I had more information like where to display it. I mean I'd say that,

242
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,620
 but I'm sure this place is shut down by now. I don't think there's many mall photo studios

243
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,300
 still in operation. What a fantastic ghost story though. I really hope it's true. It

244
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,340
 could be creepy. It was posted pretty recently by someone who just talks about other stuff

245
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,320
 online and they weren't just writing about the paranormal. But it's awesome ghost story

246
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,680
 like that would be one. I would rather go to this place because that's such a powerful

247
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,800
 ghost than go to the same old haunted insane asylum that everyone else goes to. I'm walking

248
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,160
 through. I'm all possessed by an insane person. I'm all boring. Take me to the photo studio.

249
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,520
 Fascinating ghost story. If it's true, it does transcend anything we know about ghosts.

250
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,780
 She'd be looking at demonic at that point. Or alien. And I think again whatever it was,

251
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,060
 it was flexing its power level. It wanted the people there to know how strong it truly

252
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,100
 was. Why? Who knows. Sam didn't work there for long. It wasn't because they were too

253
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,540
 scared to go back to work. They worked there for a couple weeks. I don't know what happened

254
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,900
 after that. Again, I'd like to have more information about this, but that's all the information

255
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,680
 we have so far. Terrifying story. If true, that is one of the most powerful ghosts I've

256
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,320
 ever read about or came across. SE, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to those carbonar

257
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,840
 copters. Everyone's trapped in your parachutes. SE, take us up and away where we leave behind

258
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 this mall photo studio. Take us all the way out to a bus stop. The year is truly beautiful.

259
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:08,540
 The year is 2007. We're going to meet a 7th grader online. He goes by the name NateW9731.

260
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:17,540
 We're just going to call you Nate. Nate is a 7th grader. And recently his family moved.

261
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,860
 He says we didn't move out of the area. I still attended the same middle school that

262
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,300
 I'd been going to. But we moved farther away from the school itself. So we're still in

263
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,880
 the district. We're just farther away. So I had to start taking the bus to school. And

264
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,480
 Nate explains that he's kind of a shy kid in general. And now that he's thrust onto

265
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,160
 this bus, this school bus, he's already shy since he just started riding the school bus.

266
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,120
 He doesn't have any friends on the bus. He hasn't made any friends. So it's kind of a

267
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,920
 double whammy, right? He doesn't have any friends. He's too shy to make some. And he

268
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,000
 says the bus in general was pretty rowdy. So that made him withdraw even more. Because

269
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,180
 now he's completely out of his element. He doesn't know any of these people. And they're

270
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:04,100
 a bunch of crazy people. So on this particular day back in 2007, he walks to the back of

271
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,260
 the bus. He gets on. And it loads up with all these really noisy kids that he doesn't even

272
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:22,580
 know. The bus leaves school. The bus has left school. And it's not far. It's not far from

273
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:30,720
 school. Only about a mile, he estimates. The bus is only about a mile from school. And

274
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,280
 it comes to a stoplight. This is a classic yellow school bus. So it sits really high.

275
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,720
 So Nate sitting on the very back, he can look out and he can look into other people's cars.

276
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
 And they're at this red light. The bus has stopped at this red light. And next to the

277
00:26:48,720 --> 00:27:00,180
 bus is an old 80s era Ford pickup truck. There's two guys sitting in the truck. And Nate says,

278
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:09,060
 "If I had to guess, they look like father and son." One of them was in their 50s, early

279
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:16,140
 60s. The other one seemed to be in his 30s. I'm looking into this truck, seeing these

280
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:23,440
 two dudes sitting there. The driver, who's the older one, has both of his hands on the

281
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:34,640
 steering wheel. He's staring straight ahead. The passenger is sitting there also staring

282
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:42,400
 straight ahead, his hands in his lap. And there's just a weird look to their faces. Nate's looking

283
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,900
 at these two guys. There's just something weird, something very emotionless about them.

284
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:59,460
 They're just staring straight ahead. In between the two men, Nate sees a stack of what he

285
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:07,020
 believed was folded blankets. It was a stack of folded blankets. Could have been towels,

286
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,180
 could have been rags, could have been anything, but a stack of folded blankets between the

287
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:17,440
 two men. And he goes, "The stack of the blankets, the fabric, was about as high as the men's

288
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,000
 chest." So maybe about like two feet, you know, they're sitting down, probably about

289
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,920
 like two feet high of these blankets neatly folded up. Nate's looking at these two men.

290
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,880
 He's looking at the blankets. And his eyes just kind of scan down as he's looking into

291
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,820
 this car. He's looking down this pile of blankets until he sees nestled in between the neatly

292
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:55,620
 stacked blankets and the seat of the pickup truck is the severed head of a woman. Now,

293
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,860
 Nate, even now, you know, this story happened in 2007, he's having a hard time coming to

294
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:07,400
 terms with what he saw. Such a shock. But he 100% remembers looking down the blankets

295
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,960
 and seeing this head. And he goes, "I knew it was a woman's head." He goes, "If anything,

296
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,880
 it was a young woman." He goes, "I'm looking out the school bus window and I see the severed

297
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:27,440
 woman's head and it is completely pale as if it's been drained of blood." But the worst

298
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:35,620
 part about it, the part that he can't get out of his head, was the look on her face.

299
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:45,180
 He said this woman's eyes were wide and her mouth was locked in a eternal scream. This

300
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:54,060
 severed woman's head sitting underneath the pile of blankets. And Nate is so shocked by

301
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,240
 what he's looking at, he actually begins to look around the bus. He has this crippling

302
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,840
 shyness that won't let him yell out, "Guys, look, look!" He doesn't know anyone, there's

303
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,280
 no one he can turn to, there's no one he can tap on the shoulder. And the kids are crazy

304
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,280
 anyways, they're so rambunctious, the bus is full of noise right now. He's hoping another

305
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:22,520
 kid sees it. A braver kid, a louder kid looks over and sees this woman's head. But no one

306
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:35,900
 does. "Nate just sits there," he doesn't say a word. The light turns green, the bus

307
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:44,540
 makes a left, the pickup truck continues on its journey. And to this day Nate questions

308
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:54,760
 exactly what he saw. It's an interesting story, it's funny because Nate, when he posted this,

309
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,520
 seemed to think that this could have been paranormal, which it very well could have

310
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,800
 been. There are things that I've seen, personally seen, I'll try to find the episodes, put them

311
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,960
 in the show notes, but there are things that I've seen that when you look at something

312
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,520
 that isn't real, that doesn't make sense. And I'm not talking about like it's your

313
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,660
 imagination or something like that, you're psychotic. I'm talking about when you see

314
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:26,620
 any sort of ghostly activity that shouldn't be, your brain can create a false image to

315
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:33,420
 cover up the impossible. So for example, let's say you came home, let's say you came home

316
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:41,020
 and you have a kid and your kid was floating in air. That's impossible. That's impossible,

317
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,080
 unless your kid's Casper, that's impossible. Your kid can't float in the air. So what would

318
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,400
 happen, it doesn't happen all the time, but what could happen is you would come home and

319
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,160
 you would see your kid floating in the air and you knew that would be impossible and

320
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,560
 it's almost like a little bit of a glitch. You can't comprehend what you're looking

321
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,000
 at, but what would happen is let's say maybe three or four years later you may go, hey

322
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,020
 remember that time when Billy was balancing on three basketballs? And people are like,

323
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,860
 what are you talking about? And they're like, no, I remember one day I came home and Billy

324
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,940
 was balancing on three basketballs and it's completely impossible. That's that's equally

325
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:26,180
 impossible. But it's more plausible than your kid floating. That type of stuff does happen.

326
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,260
 So sometimes when we look at super bizarre memories that just don't make sense. We can

327
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,600
 look at a paranormal answer for those things. So I can see where Nate's coming from where

328
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,040
 he's saying that it's possible that what I saw was actually something paranormal that

329
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,040
 shouldn't have existed and my brain was processing it in that way. His logic behind that was

330
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,760
 there was no blood. There was no blood. I'm looking at the severed head, but there was

331
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,240
 no blood in the car. It wasn't dripping out any sort of blood. If it was a real severed

332
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,460
 head, there would have been blood. He also does to be fair, he does also bring up that

333
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,940
 it could have been a prank that could have been a Halloween prop as well. It's possible.

334
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,260
 Those are all definitely possible. I don't think this was a paranormal event, though.

335
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,580
 It actually wouldn't make sense these series of events that would make this a true crime

336
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,300
 tragedy for one when you decapitate somebody the head itself doesn't contain a ton of

337
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,520
 blood. While your brain needs blood and your skin needs blood and all this stuff and you

338
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:38,320
 need oxygen in your head, that's true. But it doesn't contain... I know it has a lot

339
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,360
 of blood. It has a lot of blood as compared to maybe your fingers, but you could drain

340
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,880
 a human head quicker than you could drain a human leg. It doesn't contain a lot of blood

341
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,840
 to begin with. You actually, when you decapitate someone, you could drain the blood out of

342
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:01,740
 a head fairly quickly. So the head not bleeding isn't a sign that it's paranormal, too. We

343
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,580
 don't know the situation here, right? It looked like it was a young woman's head here. So

344
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,780
 if you really were transporting a young woman's head, why would you transport it in that way,

345
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,500
 in between the two people with the blankets stacked up on top of it? The blankets would

346
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,820
 make sense to cover up the sight of the head for anyone who is driving by in a normal sized

347
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,560
 car. You know, no one would think that the bus is elevated, that there's a chance that

348
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,080
 you might come next to a school bus. Criminals aren't... they don't have a lot of foresight.

349
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,280
 That's generally why they get caught. But that would make sense. They're gonna cover

350
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,520
 it up. You go, "Why didn't they just put it in a box?" It's super interesting because

351
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,600
 when we do look at criminals, they do... not all of them, right? There's a lot of monsters

352
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:56,260
 out there, but most criminals were ordinary people up until the crime. They may have drug

353
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,260
 problems, gambling problems, things like that, but for the most part, they're ordinary people

354
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:10,100
 before the crime was committed. And you have all your normal superstitions and normal traditions

355
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,580
 and beliefs. Just 'cause you've murdered someone doesn't... you don't go, "Well, I guess I'm

356
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,040
 not Southern Baptist anymore." No, you're just Southern Baptist who murdered somebody.

357
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,720
 I could see if this victim was somebody that they knew that they wouldn't want to throw

358
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:34,200
 the head in a tackle box. It feels very disrespectful. It is an interesting quirk of crime, but you

359
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,680
 will... you know, you bury bodies after crimes for two reasons. One, to hide the evidence,

360
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,940
 to kill the two, also 'cause you don't want the body picked up by scavengers. You don't...

361
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,220
 you knew this person. You knew this person. You guys hung out for years and years, and

362
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,140
 then a drug deal went bad. He ripped off a bunch of money from you. You can't let that

363
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,700
 stand. Otherwise, everyone will rip off money from you. So you do have to kill this guy,

364
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:04,620
 but you don't want him eaten by the rats in the alleyway. So you could... I could see

365
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:12,000
 that happening. I could see them not throwing her head in a tackle box and those eyes wide

366
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,320
 staring into the darkness as it rumbles back and forth across the flatbed of the truck.

367
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:25,920
 I could see them wanting to have some sense of grace, some sense of compassion for this

368
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,560
 head. The number one reason why I think this is a real head, and again, the story could

369
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,460
 totally be made up. This could be creepy, but the reason why out of all of this that

370
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,740
 I think it was a real head was a detail that Nate said. Because while this detail isn't

371
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,780
 impossible to make up, most people don't think of it this way. Most people don't think of

372
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,300
 things like this. A violent death is a violent death. In the movies, people get shot, they

373
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,300
 fall down, they die. People get hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat, they

374
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,480
 fall down, they die. Or if it's the hero, he just goes "ouch." But in reality, killing

375
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,080
 someone is extremely violent. You start off trying to strangle somebody and then three

376
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,600
 and a half minutes later, the person is still alive, you grab the claw hammer. That's generally

377
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,520
 how it happens. Unless you come with your own murder weapon, and even then, stuff can

378
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,720
 go south, guns, jams, knives, break off. People go to houses with a steak knife that's used

379
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,660
 to cut steak, and now they're trying to stab someone in the rib cage with it, it's not

380
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:35,780
 going to work. I mean, it actually does work, but the chance of a malfunction goes up because

381
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,660
 it's not designed for combat. It's not designed to go into a human.

382
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,100
 Violent death is extremely violent. It's an extremely violent way to go. If you asked

383
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,180
 the average person, "What would a severed head look like?" If you chopped a head off,

384
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,540
 most people are just going to immediately think of something they had seen in the haunted

385
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,920
 mansion down in Disneyland or something they had seen in a movie, or like a guillotine

386
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,640
 type movie. It gets chopped off, it's a pretty clean cut. Head rolls around in the basket,

387
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,800
 right? Draw a picture of a chopped off head. And that is pretty accurate. When you chop

388
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,360
 a head off in combat, when you chop a head off while you're fighting someone, it's not

389
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:27,140
 a clean line. But if you are doing it post-mortem, you can make it fairly clean. I've seen quite

390
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,220
 a few severed heads in my life because my father used to own a crematory, and that was

391
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:37,820
 my summer job. So when you find these bodies that have been chopped up, it's pretty even

392
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,020
 cut. It's pretty even cut. I'm not saying you could put... I'm not saying that you could

393
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,160
 put a bubble level on it and it'd be perfect, but a detail that most people would miss.

394
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,860
 If you want... If I said show me the severed head of a murder victim, if I wanted to draw

395
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,500
 a picture of that, if I wanted you to just describe a severed head of a murder victim

396
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:02,820
 to me. One of the key details that I think a lot of people would leave out, and it's

397
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,860
 a key detail that Nate said, it's something that he observed, this image has been with

398
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:17,560
 him all these years, was that the woman's head was missing teeth. That is very common

399
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,640
 in a violent crime, and it's not something that most people would associate. If I asked

400
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,120
 you to picture a severed head, or to draw me a picture of a severed head, very few people

401
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,360
 would draw that picture with teeth missing. But it is... I mean teeth get knocked out

402
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,740
 in fights all the time. Teeth get knocked out in sports all the time. So when you're

403
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,980
 trying to murder somebody, teeth will break. Teeth will break, teeth will shatter. If it's

404
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,140
 a fight, if you're trying to strangle someone, again it takes a long period of time, it's

405
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,380
 a very, very violent death. If you're trying to hold someone down, you go, "Well we're

406
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,020
 just going to drown her in a bathtub." And as you're getting her head to go in there,

407
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,960
 her jaw hits the rim of the bathtub, she's going to break teeth. It's super common for

408
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,600
 a murder victim to not have all of their teeth in their face. It's not something you hear

409
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,280
 about a lot, because we, most people see the depiction of violence that they see, they're

410
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,760
 not seeing it on real life, and if they're not seeking it out in gore videos, they see

411
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,400
 what they see in Hollywood. So the fact that the head was missing teeth makes me think he

412
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,740
 saw a real severed woman's head. And these people, we don't know what happened, we don't

413
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,700
 know who the woman was, we don't know where they went, we don't know if these people were

414
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,780
 ever caught, we don't know if they were locals, there's so many questions about the story,

415
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,580
 but I do believe that head was real. If the story's real, if these details that Nate wrote

416
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,700
 are real, I think that was a real head. If it's creepypasta, it's creepypasta, I apologize

417
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,440
 for wasting your time. But it's a terrifying story, it's such a terrifying story, because

418
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:07,920
 in the end, you know, when we, if we suffer a violent death, I think the most we want

419
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:15,180
 is to be remembered and to be abenged. It's just such a tragic story, right? You can imagine

420
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,080
 this young woman in the last moments of her life not wanting to die, obviously, fighting

421
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,260
 for her life, that's why she would have lost her teeth in the first place. And then as

422
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:31,380
 she's dying, praying that she gets some justice, praying that these men don't get away with

423
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:39,360
 killing her. But when that light turned green, and that little boy sat there on that bus

424
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:47,380
 too shy to say anything, they did get away with it. We don't know for how long, they

425
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,700
 could have been arrested, like I said, they could have been arrested the next day, they

426
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,440
 could still be out there. This could have been a one off murder that was committed over

427
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,280
 drugs or jealousy or something like that, or these guys could have been budding serial

428
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,240
 killers we don't know. And I'm not blaming Nate, right? He's in seventh grade, he's a

429
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,080
 shy kid, I'm not blaming Nate, but it's just kind of a sad story and a creepy one at the

430
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:16,960
 same time. Who was the girl, why was she killed, who were the men, are they still out there?

431
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,740
 We'll never have any answers to any of those questions. All we can hope is that whatever

432
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:30,020
 happened, even though we don't know who that young girl is, there's someone out there

433
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:39,220
 who does remember her. That she didn't live her entire life just to be forgotten. Just

434
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:48,660
 to become a story posted on the internet. Just to become a screaming head tucked under

435
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:58,180
 some blankets in an old Ford pickup.

436
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,360
