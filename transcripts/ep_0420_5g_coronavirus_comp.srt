1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 A woman has an encounter with a strange man, and it almost kills her.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,200
 And then we take a look at the absolutely most bizarre conspiracy theory going around right now, and that's a high bar.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,500
 Our 5G towers actually causing the coronavirus today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,200
 [Music]

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys had a great weekend.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,600
 We got a lot of stuff to cover. We're gonna get started right now.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,700
 First off, we have to give a shout out to our latest Patreon, Mr. Twister.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
 Give a hand for Mr. Twister. Really, really appreciate the support.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,500
 Means a lot. Helps keep the show going. If you can't support the show via Patreon though, that's fine too.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,400
 Just help get the word out about the show. I know it's a little bit harder now that everyone's locked inside,

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
 but whatever online form you're at, just say, "Hey man, I'm checking out this podcast."

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,300
 You should listen to it. It's really, really dope.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,000
 And the guy has a really handsome sounding voice.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Second thing we gotta talk about real quick, and Mr. Twister again, thank you so much.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
 You'll be getting the keys to the Carpenter copter in a second.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,700
 But before we do that, Friday night we had the Dead Rabbit Movie Club. I had a lot of fun doing that.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,000
 Tonight's movie, if you want to join the movie club, you can watch it on Shutter, or I'm sure you can find it in other places as well.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,500
 Housewife. It's a movie called Housewife.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,300
 It's about a young woman who witnessed the murder of her sister, and was never able to get over it,

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:46,100
 until she meets a self-help guru/cult leader who is willing to go to any lengths to help her resolve her problems.

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 It's really good. I watched it yesterday.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's really good. Check it out. Housewife. It's available on Shutter, and you can find it in other places as well.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,300
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here. That's the first episode of the movie club for this week, though.

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,600
 Let's get started with the episode.

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,000
 Mr. Twister, fire up that Carpenter copter. We are flying out to...

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
 Unknown City, USA.

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,700
 Actually, to be fair, I don't know if it's in the United States. That's my own bias.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
 All the cool stories take place in the USA.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
 [hums]

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,800
 Helicopters landing, things twister. The thing is, I don't know where the story takes place.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,600
 This was a story I found off of Reddit. It's very telling, and I think it actually kind of leads into our next topic as well.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,100
 This is an interesting one.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,400
 March 27th, 2020.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,800
 We're walking through the streets of Unknown City, USA.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,900
 And there is a Reddit user there. We're just going to call her Tori. That's a name I made up.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,400
 If that's actually her real name, that's not as far as I know. But anyways, Tori is walking on the street.

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
 And we're walking on the street behind her. That sounds creepy. No, we're not.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,800
 We are... We're wearing a trench coat, right? And I'm the bottom person, and you're on my shoulder so you can see the story.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,500
 I already see the story. For some reason, that's not... That's less creepier than following her.

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,200
 But anyways, we're watching Tori walk down the street.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,800
 She's walking her little doggies, right? Little doggie people are walking.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
 [imitates dog barking]

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,600
 And she looks down an alley, and she sees a bizarre sight.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,900
 She sees a man sitting on like an old steamer trunk.

46
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,400
 Like one of those big old trunks she would see in like some Agatha Christie movie, right?

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,200
 Or just if you took a train today, they may still be there, I don't know.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,900
 But it was like an old-timey trunk. There was a man sitting on it smoking a cigarette.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,100
 And you're thinking, "That's not bizarre. That's actually less bizarre than me sitting on your shoulders as we're both in a trench coat."

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,600
 And I go, "Well, true, but something about it made her feel off."

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,900
 And she's walking, and she's on the opposite side of the street, so she's looking down the alleyway across the street and she sees the guy.

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,600
 Something about it made her feel that this is out of place.

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:01,000
 And she decides, "I'm gonna continue my walk, but when I'm coming back the other way, I'm gonna cross the street, and if he's still there, I'm gonna talk to him."

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,500
 Now, it's kind of a bold move, right? You have the woman cross the street now.

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,700
 Tori is now walking back home. So now she is walking on that side of the street, and she's walking.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,100
 And she doesn't see him in that first alley now. She sees him in a different alley, and he's comically slipping and sliding on ice.

57
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,400
 Whoa, whoa, like Mr. Bean, basically.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,500
 Now, she doesn't really go into like his body proportions, but when I read the story, no matter how many times I've read the story,

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 because I read it once, then I had to read it again, prep reading the notes, and now I'm reading it to you, basically.

60
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 A picture of him is tall and gangly, and a bit older, but she never did--it's weird, because the story kind of fills in those details,

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 and I wonder if you--I picture him kind of gangly and stuff.

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,200
 Anyways, whoa, whoa, whoa, he keeps slipping and sliding on ice, kind of like that scene from Bambi, but he doesn't have four legs.

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 He just can't find his balance on the ice.

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,000
 Now, she says that her dogs are normally pretty, like, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,700
 One is always kind of angry, and one's super hyper, but this time, when this guy is having these--because now they're on the same side of the street.

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,500
 It's just a different alleyway, as he's slipping and sliding on the ice.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,200
 Neither dogs respond to what's going on, which she finds very odd, because the hyper one wants lots of loves and kisses,

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,900
 and the other one wants to beat, like, beat everyone up. They're both tiny, though.

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,900
 She does start to approach him, though, and she says everything about him seemed old,

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,500
 but in that sense--again, she wasn't really talking about his physical age.

71
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,900
 She was specifically mentioning the clothing. The clothing looked out of date,

72
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,700
 just like the big steamer trunk looked out of date and out of time.

73
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,900
 She's getting closer and closer to him, and she goes, "Do you need any help?"

74
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,200
 Like, he obviously needs help, right? The guy can't stand up on ice.

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,300
 He obviously needs help, and he goes, "No. No, no, no, I'm fine."

76
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,500
 He's still trying to get somewhere across the ice, and she goes, "Where are you headed?"

77
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 And he goes, "I'm headed to, like, this place."

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,300
 And she didn't recognize that place. She had never heard of that place.

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,600
 Now, it wasn't like Gumbo Land. It was like a restaurant or a store or something like that.

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,500
 It wasn't like, "I'm going back to the mythical realm of Osreel."

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,200
 No, no, no, it was like a place, like a department store, something like that.

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
 We'll get to that detail in a second.

83
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,900
 But she asks, "Where are you going?" And he said, "This place."

84
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,200
 And then she goes, "Well, I hope you get there safely."

85
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,100
 Because he's obviously having some trouble just standing up in an alleyway.

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,400
 And, "I wish I could do more for you," as she says.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,100
 And then he turns to her and says, "Quote, you did exactly what you needed to, sweetheart.

88
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,600
 Thank you."

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,100
 And then he just continued. He finally got his footing and walked down the alleyway and turned.

90
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,000
 And then she never saw him again.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
 Now, she goes home. She looks up the place. She's curious.

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
 The whole encounter was really weird.

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,400
 So she looks at the place he said he was going.

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
 [GASP]

95
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,200
 That place closed down 50 years ago.

96
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,300
 Now, obviously, we don't know this person's real name.

97
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,600
 It's on Reddit. They have a username.

98
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,100
 They don't-- We don't know what city takes place in or what the business was.

99
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,400
 We can't verify any of the particular facts.

100
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,800
 So, is the story true or not?

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,100
 We, as an audience, don't know. This was on the Reddit account or this was on the Reddit forum.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,700
 The truth is here, which has a lot of stuff like this.

103
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,200
 Most of it is, "I woke up and my cat possessed me and now I want milk."

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,400
 Just really, like, people with obvious-- Obvious mental problems, I think.

105
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,800
 I'm not saying she has one, but I'm saying you get a lot of that stuff and then you get some legit stuff.

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
 Things like that. But anyways, you have this here.

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
 Now, the story itself. The girl walking down the street.

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
 She turns the corner and there's a man out of time.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,700
 That's typical dead rabbit radio fare.

110
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,800
 There's not enough meat to that story, so you jump up off my shoulders.

111
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,100
 Now, I'm taking off the trench coat. I have normal clothes on underneath. Don't worry.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,800
 Don't worry. And we're standing there in the street and you go, "So, is that the story?"

113
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
 And I go, "No, no, no. That's the preamble."

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,500
 Because while that story is interesting, that's-- It's just a man out of time.

115
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,600
 Now we get to the meat of this. Now, this story takes place March 27th, 2020.

116
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,000
 Let me read you a bit more of this Reddit post.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
 This is the actual quote.

118
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
 "Since then, things haven't been the same.

119
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,100
 I have chronic, life-limiting health problems, but I've never felt like I was going to die soon

120
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,000
 the way I've felt since this encounter."

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,700
 Okay, let me remind you one more time before I read this next sentence.

122
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,500
 This is March 27th, 2020.

123
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:47,300
 "Short of breath, blew around the lips, pale, and no, no exposure to the virus.

124
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,200
 Waking up from strange dreams and a cold sweat, a constant foreboding feeling.

125
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 I'm going to die soon. I even had a seizure."

126
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,900
 Now, now, now.

127
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:07,900
 "At any other point in human history, if someone said, 'I saw a ghost and now I have a fever,

128
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,500
 I can't breathe, my lips are turning blue, my face is turning blue,'"

129
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,400
 I feel like I'm going to die at any moment.

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,200
 People would probably go, "Whoa, dude, this ghost."

131
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,800
 The rest of the Reddit responses were, "Go to the doctor, dude."

132
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,900
 You basically had 30 comments saying, "Go to the doctor!

133
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,800
 You obviously have been exposed to the coronavirus!

134
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,400
 What are you doing typing this out?

135
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,700
 Go to the doctor."

136
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,300
 And then, pretty much, I found this thread when it first happened, right?

137
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,500
 And I was like, "What? I'm reading it."

138
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,300
 Because a lot of this stuff, I skim because I read a ton of this stuff and it's like,

139
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,400
 "At the end, you can tell it's a lark, you can tell it's whatever."

140
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,300
 And I remember reading this and I'm being like, "Oh my God, this poor girl is dead."

141
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,600
 And you just saw the comments fill up, "Go to the doctor.

142
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
 Go to the doctor, please!

143
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,800
 Comment after comment."

144
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,200
 And it's funny because normally, in these types of threads,

145
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,600
 you'll have people go, "Oh my God, the ghost must be in you.

146
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,500
 Say this or go to this location and get it cured."

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,800
 So what happened was she--

148
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,900
 There was basically-- the thread went quiet.

149
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,000
 Basically, people were like, "Dude, I hope she's still alive."

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,900
 And then, maybe a day or two passed and she said, "Thank you, guys.

151
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,600
 I went to the doctor and I was having some breathing issues."

152
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,900
 She still has never said that she actually did have the coronavirus,

153
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:43,800
 but I think the timing of the post and everyone being very aware of the signs of breathing difficulties right now

154
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,200
 got her to go to the emergency room where she did get tested

155
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
 and they gave her a bunch of breathing treatments.

156
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,600
 Apparently, she does have, like she said at the beginning, some lingering health issues.

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,300
 But almost died!

158
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,200
 She in her post with, "I'm terrified.

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,900
 I don't know what I saw, but I don't think it was anything good.

160
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
 I wish I could go back and unsee it.

161
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,300
 Maybe then none of this would be happening."

162
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,500
 So I guess she does really combine the fact that she had shortness of breath

163
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,700
 and her lips were turning blue to the fact that she saw this site.

164
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,000
 Now, when she came back, when she comes back after saying, "Thank you, guys.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,900
 I did go get medical treatment because I was having, I was basically dying."

166
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
 When your face is turning blue and your lips are turning blue,

167
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,700
 that is the point where you need to be in the emergency room at Rhymes.

168
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,900
 She said, "I still 100% believe I saw what I saw."

169
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,000
 Like, that is, I was having this health issue, but I 100% saw this thing the day before.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
 But this woman could easily died.

171
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,100
 And again, I think if she had posted this six months earlier,

172
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,900
 when people weren't looking for the signs and people weren't aware,

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,400
 I didn't know blue lips was a sign of someone about to suffocate.

174
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
 I never knew that.

175
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,900
 And now I do.

176
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,900
 And, um, yeah, interesting, though.

177
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,000
 The fact that a bunch of fellow weirdos on Reddit,

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 but yeah, and Anne, I just checked again today, she's still posting on Reddit,

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,900
 she's still alive and healthy.

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,800
 You know what? Here's my theory. Here's my theory.

181
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,600
 Think about this. What if she was walking on the street and didn't see the creepy old man

182
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,400
 and just her lips turned blue and she didn't get it treated and she died?

183
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,000
 Maybe the old man was there so she would post on Reddit,

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
 so a bunch of people would tell her to go to the hospital.

185
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,900
 Hmm, hmm.

186
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,900
 Maybe the old man wasn't a spooky old man,

187
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,000
 but a guardian angel sent to save her life.

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,100
 Also in the future mess, if you're listening to this podcast,

189
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,300
 just go to the hospital for medical problems. Don't post on Reddit.

190
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,100
 Let's go ahead and move on, but it's good that she didn't.

191
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,000
 And I'm, we were all concerned that she was going to die,

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
 but she didn't and that's good.

193
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
 Let's go ahead and move on.

194
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,300
 It's always good when humans don't die.

195
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
 I didn't know if you needed to hear that from me.

196
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
 Let's move on to our next subject here.

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
 Our next subject is breaking news.

198
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,300
 I actually didn't plan for this to be today's topic.

199
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
 I had something else planned.

200
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,800
 That'll be on tomorrow's episode.

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
 Mr. Twister, fire up that carbonicopter.

202
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
 We're headed out to Britain.

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
 We're flying over the ocean.

204
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
 We're heading on out.

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,300
 We are headed and we know we're getting close to Britain

206
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,200
 because we see plumes of smoke.

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:24,900
 Just pouring out over the continent.

208
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,000
 We can barely see the Emerald Isle, which is Ireland,

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 but we're flying over that before we get to Britain.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,300
 Bring us lower, Twister.

211
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,300
 We're now flying among the cities we're going over.

212
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
 Do they have skyscrapers in Britain?

213
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,000
 Everything looks awfully small over there.

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
 What's their tallest building?

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,800
 Like 20 stories.

216
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
 I think, I mean, like, is there anything bigger

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
 than Big Ben over there?

218
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,800
 Technically, there shouldn't be

219
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
 because then it's not Big Ben anymore.

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,400
 I saw this documentary once called G.I. Joe Retaliation

221
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,300
 and they dropped this giant metal spear from the sky, right?

222
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,200
 And it crashed into Britain and completely pulverized

223
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,800
 the entire city of England.

224
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,100
 And the buildings looked awfully small.

225
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
 Those CGI buildings that got destroyed

226
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,500
 as the Earth's mantle got rippled by that giant rod of God,

227
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
 which is supposedly a real weapon.

228
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,700
 I know G.I. Joe's not real.

229
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,600
 Okay, no G.I. Joe's not real.

230
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,900
 But supposedly if you drop a tungsten,

231
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,700
 a big enough piece of tungsten,

232
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,900
 or probably really any metal,

233
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,300
 but I think tungsten, I just like that word, tungsten,

234
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,800
 falls from the sky

235
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,900
 and there's no explosive tipper whatsoever.

236
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,300
 The gravity of it, when it hits the Earth,

237
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,000
 will cause a explosion greater than or equal to a nuclear bomb

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,700
 and you just kind of just let them fall.

239
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,600
 I think they'd be kind of hard to aim.

240
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
 I mean, I'm not saying the wind's going to be pushing them around,

241
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,900
 but like, you're like fire, what?

242
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,900
 What did you say? Fire in that delay, like that short delay.

243
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,900
 Is the difference between hitting England or hitting Moscow?

244
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,600
 And they probably have people working at the command centers

245
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
 with better hearing too.

246
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
 They're probably not like, what'd you say?

247
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,000
 They're like, you can't work here.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
 If whenever someone says, hey, give me a cup of coffee,

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
 you go, what'd you say?

250
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,100
 Because eventually you're going to have to press a button

251
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,400
 and launch a missile.

252
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,100
 Like you can have a laser guided missile,

253
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,400
 but you can't have a laser guided rock fall from the sky.

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,800
 Anyways, I don't think England has tall buildings.

255
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,200
 So we're flying among their teeny tiny buildings in England.

256
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,300
 [imitates laser guidance]

257
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,400
 We find the source of all these plumes of smoke.

258
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,800
 They're cell phone towers.

259
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,500
 More specifically, 5G cell phone towers.

260
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,800
 Dun, dun, dun.

261
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,700
 Now we've talked about 5G technology before.

262
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,500
 It's this new loony bin conspiracy theory that,

263
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,300
 I did a whole episode on it a while back, but basically,

264
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,700
 so 5G, so your phone right now is probably 4G.

265
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
 It's the cellular technology.

266
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,100
 5G has smaller millimeter waves.

267
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,300
 So you get like a better talk quality, better sound quality,

268
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 and your phones, the streaming services are faster and stuff

269
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
 like that, but you need, because the waves are smaller,

270
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,700
 you need to have more cell towers in an area.

271
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,100
 Instead of a cell tower, say every 20 miles,

272
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,000
 you have to have a cell tower every 500 yards or something

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,100
 like that.

274
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,800
 So you would have them all over a city.

275
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,400
 The conspiracy theory for a while was that 5G caused you

276
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
 to kill yourself.

277
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,900
 That was a big conspiracy theory going around for a long time.

278
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,300
 That the 5G penetrates your, "Oh, it's going through my cells.

279
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,200
 Oh my God, it's messing with the water in me."

280
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,500
 Does that.

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,400
 There's this real famous doctor, scientist guy from the

282
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
 University of Washington.

283
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,100
 His name is Martin Paul.

284
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,600
 He said that eventually it would make us all sterile.

285
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,700
 Once it all gets rolled out, it'll make us sterile within

286
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
 three years, and then eight years later,

287
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
 it'll make us all brain dead.

288
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,700
 Martin Paul saying that your brains are going to melt after

289
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,500
 eight years of having all the 5G turned on.

290
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,800
 No rational person wants everyone's brains melted because

291
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,900
 they're human as well, right?

292
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,400
 So the conspiracy theory is involving 5G has been going

293
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,500
 around for a long time, but now it's hit a fever pitch,

294
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,200
 because now in Britain, within the past week,

295
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,700
 seven to eight 5G cell phone towers have been set on fire

296
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,100
 because of the coronavirus.

297
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
 This is a really interesting one.

298
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,300
 I talked about this recently a couple episodes ago.

299
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,100
 I said, "If you thought the conspiracy theories that came

300
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,900
 out of 9/11 were crazy, you haven't seen anything yet."

301
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,800
 That's actually, I underestimated that,

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,900
 because I said after this is all done,

303
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
 and the thing when you look at the 9,

304
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,100
 and so they're already starting, they're going full bore on

305
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
 this, and after 9/11, you know, after 9/11,

306
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,300
 so I used to live in Orangevale, California.

307
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,600
 We had a lot of peckerwoods out there.

308
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,700
 If you don't know what peckerwood is,

309
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,500
 it's basically a white supremacist street gang,

310
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,900
 a way of life.

311
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,200
 It's kind of like a West Side redneck peckerwoods.

312
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
 We had a lot of peckerwoods hanging out there.

313
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
 A lot of white supremacists where I grew up.

314
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,400
 And I remember we had a mailman who was Sikh, really nice guy.

315
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,100
 He had the, not the turban, and they're not called the turban,

316
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
 but you know the headrest, the head, not the headrest,

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,100
 the head thing, right?

318
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,400
 And he was a nice guy, Sikh.

319
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 After 9/11, probably about two weeks after 9/11,

320
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,500
 now, to be, and the Sikhs are not Muslim,

321
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,800
 but even if he was Muslim, he would not have excused

322
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,300
 what was going to happen.

323
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,700
 But he was delivering mail, probably a block or two

324
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,000
 from my grandma's house, where I lived on and off

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
 for a lot of my time in Sacramento.

326
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,700
 About two, three weeks after 9/11,

327
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,800
 he was delivering mail, probably about a block or two

328
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,100
 from my grandma's house, and a dude came out of the house,

329
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,000
 shot him in the neck,

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,700
 because he was one of them dirty Muslims,

331
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
 put a bullet through him.

332
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,000
 He lived, shockingly lived,

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,900
 so it probably was a graze.

334
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,000
 It probably wasn't a straight like through the carotid.

335
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,100
 Doesn't matter.

336
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,400
 He shot in the neck, is a shot in the neck.

337
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,700
 So we had incidents like that,

338
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,400
 but as far as people actually,

339
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,500
 that I think was a people going,

340
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 we're at war, and that guy's the enemy.

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,200
 And unfortunately, that guy was delivering mail in an area.

342
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,700
 They had a lot of white supremacy.

343
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
 And again, not people who were simply racist,

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,300
 people who would beat up minorities.

345
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
 Again, not people who are like,

346
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,400
 "What a black captain on Star Trek.

347
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
 I'm not watching that show."

348
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
 These were people that would shoot you in the neck

349
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,000
 if they thought you were Muslim.

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
 That's where I grew up, guys.

351
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
 So anyways, you have that.

352
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,300
 This is a conspiracy theory

353
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,200
 where people are actively launching attacks against it

354
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,100
 as it's going on.

355
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,600
 I haven't seen anything like this.

356
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,700
 I haven't seen anything like this.

357
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,200
 When we look at other conspiracy theories,

358
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
 like people who say Sandy Hook didn't happen.

359
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,700
 It 100% did.

360
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,700
 That's a complete myth that it didn't.

361
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 Anyways, people, that took years

362
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,900
 before people knocking on doors.

363
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 What happened to your kid?

364
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,800
 I think it was a fake.

365
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,900
 All that, all that,

366
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,700
 just that's absolutely disgusting.

367
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,900
 All that stuff happened years after the Aurora movie shooting.

368
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,200
 Someone shoots up movie theater two years later.

369
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
 Did your son really die in that movie?

370
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,400
 I mean, can you imagine saying that to somebody?

371
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,100
 Anyways, that'll happen afterwards.

372
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
 This is happening now.

373
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,500
 People are setting 5G cell phone towers on fire in Britain.

374
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
 There's some interesting questions to come out of this too.

375
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,900
 My first question is why so far, why only Britain?

376
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,600
 Makes you think it's probably the same person, right?

377
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
 We're the same group of people.

378
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,400
 We're not seeing this in other places, but...

379
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 That's an interesting part of this conspiracy.

380
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,500
 Let's kind of jump into this.

381
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,200
 Within the past week,

382
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,600
 we've had seven to eight attacks on 5G towers in Britain.

383
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,500
 People are setting them on fire.

384
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,200
 The telecom companies in Britain

385
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
 are now going to YouTube and Twitter

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,600
 and saying, "You need to shut this down right now."

387
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
 "You need to shut this down."

388
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,900
 And YouTube said, "We will."

389
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,500
 And this may get wrapped up in this too.

390
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,700
 So this episode may only...

391
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,600
 You might be hearing this on YouTube.

392
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,300
 I think if you're a subscriber, you'll get it.

393
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,500
 If you're listening to the podcast, you'll definitely get it.

394
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,100
 The YouTube algorithm will probably kick this into a...

395
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
 They use the term "suppression,"

396
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,300
 but I think it's more of not promoting it.

397
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,600
 So you may not get a notification for this episode.

398
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,300
 It definitely won't be able to get demonetized.

399
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,100
 Even though I'm against the conspiracy theory,

400
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,500
 it's pretty likely that the bot will nab me and say,

401
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,000
 "Uh-uh, this is just you."

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
 Because right now, YouTube's setting it up

403
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,200
 that if you use the words "5G" and "coronavirus" together,

404
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,700
 or in the same, you're connecting that conspiracy,

405
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,300
 they will not promote your video.

406
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,100
 They'll limit how many people can see it, stuff like that.

407
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,400
 Some people say that suppression.

408
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,100
 I think it's really just equibling of words.

409
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,900
 Right?

410
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,600
 YouTube's a private platform, and they're going to do what they want,

411
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,700
 and this show could get deplatformed from YouTube at any moment.

412
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,400
 And like I said, if that happens,

413
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,900
 we're just going to be straight on the podcast.

414
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,900
 I'm not going to be upload.

415
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,800
 I'm not going to play that game,

416
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 where I'm running around fighting YouTube and stuff like that.

417
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,100
 So if the show ever does disappear from YouTube,

418
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
 you know where to get it, Dead Rabbit Radio,

419
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
 anywhere podcasts are available.

420
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,300
 I'm not going to go to Bitshoot or anything like that.

421
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,900
 The telecoms are saying, and other people are saying this,

422
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,200
 this is actually a quote from Professor Adam Finn

423
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,500
 from the University of Bristol.

424
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,600
 He says, "The internet connections these network give us

425
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,800
 are the most important tools we are using to coordinate

426
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
 our response to the epidemic and efforts

427
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
 to be researched to overcome it.

428
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,200
 Damaging phone masts is like knocking holes in your lifeboats

429
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
 while your ship sinks."

430
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,100
 If all of these towers are knocked down,

431
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,000
 or a percentage of them are knocked down,

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,900
 it's going to cripple the cellular network over there.

433
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
 They don't do it is what they're saying.

434
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,300
 And that's why they're leaning on Twitter and YouTube

435
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
 to take action against this.

436
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,400
 What's interesting is that YouTube will put these videos down.

437
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,300
 However, a video just about 5G conspiracies

438
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,100
 not related to coronavirus, they will not touch.

439
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,300
 They totally leave up.

440
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 That's fine.

441
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,200
 It's the 5G and coronavirus videos that they're taking a look at.

442
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,900
 And obviously if a human listened to this,

443
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,600
 I think they'd go, "Oh, this is fine.

444
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,000
 He's actually dismissing this conspiracy theory."

445
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,800
 However, the algorithm again, this episode may not be on YouTube.

446
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,600
 And if it is on YouTube, it may not be on YouTube for long.

447
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
 You know, Jorge, I hate to mispronounce your name, buddy,

448
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 but on YouTube, Jorge Duarte posted a comment a while back

449
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,900
 about how some people believe that coronavirus is a cover

450
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,300
 to keep us all inside while they're installing 5G.

451
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,400
 So we have another version of the conspiracy here

452
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,100
 that 5G doesn't cause coronavirus.

453
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,800
 That coronavirus is completely made up

454
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,100
 so that 5G towers can be installed in schools

455
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,500
 and all these other places

456
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,000
 that we normally wouldn't let them put a cell tower.

457
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Now, there's a conspiracy theory about everything.

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
 I would love to see the back-to-school celebration

459
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,700
 where a guy goes open this locker and there's a 5G tower in there

460
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,600
 or they're having the prom.

461
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,400
 And the theme is best millimeters ever.

462
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,800
 And it's just like, everyone's absorbing on these millimeters.

463
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,100
 There's a lot of conspiracy theories wrapped around the fact

464
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,700
 that now while we're locked in our house,

465
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,100
 something bigger is going on.

466
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,700
 We're arresting Ellen DeGeneres.

467
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,600
 We covered that.

468
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
 Some people believe they're using this time to build more 5G towers

469
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,900
 because we want to let them do it anyways.

470
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,800
 But let's get back to this main conspiracy theory

471
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,400
 because you go, "Okay, so YouTube is putting this stuff down.

472
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,300
 Why is Twitter? Why is Twitter involved?

473
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,900
 Are people tweeting this a bunch?"

474
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,600
 Well, it's hard to tell right now

475
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,000
 because it definitely want to hit trending.

476
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,400
 But Woody Harrelson.

477
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,900
 I like Woody Harrelson as an actor.

478
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,100
 I think he's like, I admire what he's done.

479
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,600
 He started off as a comedic actor playing a big old dummy,

480
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
 a brain-dead dude on Cheers.

481
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,100
 That's how old I am.

482
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,700
 I was watching Cheers and it was originally on.

483
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,600
 That's the prequel to Frasier for you millennials.

484
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,300
 And then he goes on and does natural-born killers

485
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,000
 and does all these dramas and true detective.

486
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,100
 And he's funny.

487
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,900
 He does Hunger Games.

488
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,700
 He does all this stuff.

489
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,300
 I like him as an actor.

490
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,900
 The problem is is that when you're an actor or you're a celebrity,

491
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,100
 when you simply tweet something,

492
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,300
 people take it as meaning more than if someone else--

493
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,100
 people take it as meaning more than someone else.

494
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
 He tweeted this thing and he goes,

495
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
 he says in it, "I got this from a friend of mine.

496
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
 A lot of my friends--" and I'm paraphrasing,

497
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,700
 "I got this from a friend of mine.

498
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,900
 A lot of my friends are kind of scared of 5G.

499
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,900
 They're not really sure of the health ramifications of this."

500
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,100
 He goes, "I haven't vetted this yet,

501
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,300
 but I thought I'd share it with you guys."

502
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
 Well, if you haven't vetted it,

503
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,800
 you probably shouldn't have shared it because I vetted it.

504
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 It says, "This is a conspiracy theory."

505
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
 I know I've been beaten around the corner.

506
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
 This is a conspiracy theory.

507
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,900
 Wuhan was chosen to be the first city in China

508
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,800
 that was going to be the smart city.

509
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,600
 It was going to have more 5G connected towers

510
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 throughout the city than any other city in China.

511
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,500
 It was chosen to be that one.

512
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,200
 They had 5G towers everywhere.

513
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,900
 It was going to-- everything was going to be connected.

514
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,200
 The stoplights were all using 5G technology.

515
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,200
 Everyone's phones are going to be super speedy.

516
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,900
 And they did.

517
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,000
 They put these towers all through Wuhan.

518
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
 It was the very first city in China

519
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,900
 and it turns out that that was the cause of what's going on.

520
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,400
 Now, it's interesting because there's two versions of this conspiracy theory.

521
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
 One is--

522
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
 This is what the Lunatic--

523
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,800
 This is what even the more Lunatic conspiracy theory is.

524
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,900
 The coronavirus is caused by 5G.

525
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,600
 The symptoms of coronavirus are the exact same thing

526
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,200
 as the symptoms of exposure to these millimeter waves.

527
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,400
 That's actually the crazier version.

528
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,900
 What other people are saying and what this Woody Harrelson report is saying

529
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,000
 and what I found mostly on the internet

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 is that the coronavirus is real,

531
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
 but it normally wouldn't have affected us.

532
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 It's the fact that the 5G towers are messing up our immune system

533
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,800
 is what is making us sick from this normal natural virus.

534
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,500
 And it's weird because both of these are fighting for control right now.

535
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,600
 So you have two competing conspiracy theory.

536
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
 Both of them are stupid

537
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
 and both of them are saying something that's not true

538
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,000
 and they'll never agree with each other the same way that

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,500
 the people who don't believe in conspiracy theory will believe in either one.

540
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,600
 That's what's going on right now.

541
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,000
 We have people who believe that 5G is making you sick.

542
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,100
 The fluid in your lungs, the headaches, the scratchy throat, the blue lips,

543
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,800
 it's all caused by 5G.

544
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,700
 Other people say, "No, no, no, no, no. The 5G is just weakening our immune system."

545
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,700
 What's funny is that that one is stupid,

546
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,200
 but it's definitely more believable than 5G making you sick.

547
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,400
 Why? Because we see symptoms of this disease where there's no 5G.

548
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,700
 No one's really addressing that part of it yet.

549
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,400
 But I bet you the next one will be 5G.

550
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,300
 I don't know why they hate 5G so much, but 5G made the virus stronger.

551
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,500
 That's why it's in Idaho.

552
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,300
 There's no 5G in Idaho.

553
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,200
 The 5G actually made the virus mutate.

554
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
 But here, let's go back to this thing.

555
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,500
 I could make up conspiracy theories all day long.

556
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,300
 It's actually quite fun.

557
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,600
 But here's the thing.

558
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,100
 Wuhan is not the first city to go 100% smart in China.

559
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,600
 It's not. I looked it up.

560
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,700
 Not only did I look it up within 5 minutes,

561
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,000
 I found it on a website that agrees in the conspiracy theory.

562
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,200
 So I didn't find it on a debunker website.

563
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,400
 I didn't find it on some-- I didn't find it on Snopes.

564
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,800
 I found it on a website that actually had an article saying,

565
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,500
 "Maybe this is true."

566
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,600
 And in that article, it says 16 different cities in China were chosen

567
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 to all go smart at the same time.

568
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,200
 Five of them have the exact same amount of towers in them.

569
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 Hengzhao, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuhan.

570
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
 So it's just 100% not true.

571
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,900
 And I vetted it in 5 minutes.

572
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,800
 And it's funny because when we look at that Reddit story,

573
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,300
 there's no information to really vet, right?

574
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,600
 The whole thing could have been a LARP.

575
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
 We don't know.

576
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,900
 But in this where they're like, "That was a fact."

577
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,700
 It said Wuhan was the-- and I vetted and vetted and I checked it

578
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,500
 and they said Wuhan was the first city to go smart in China.

579
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,400
 It was selected to be-- that's 100% not true.

580
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,300
 It was one of 16 and there was five other cities

581
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,400
 that has an equal amount of towers in it.

582
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,300
 So it's a flat out lie.

583
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,800
 And that's what really bugs me about this stuff.

584
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,500
 People are getting terrified.

585
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,400
 People are terrified right now, obviously.

586
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,800
 And people are using-- people are spreading that fear.

587
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,400
 And they're lying.

588
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,200
 But it doesn't even stop there

589
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,900
 because there's another conspiracy theory.

590
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,900
 That the cell-- this is completely ridiculous.

591
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,900
 That the cell phone towers are not being set on fire

592
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,100
 by conspiracy theorists protesting against 5G.

593
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,400
 They're not being set on fire by people trying to shut down 5G

594
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,300
 in their neighborhood because they believe it's causing coronavirus.

595
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,600
 There are people who believe that the cell phone towers are so dangerous

596
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,100
 they are bursting into flames all on their own.

597
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,600
 That's how dangerous 5G technology is.

598
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,700
 You just build a tower and it blows up in your neighborhood.

599
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,500
 "Oh, we better shut down 5G."

600
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,400
 A human didn't do that.

601
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,200
 They just-- that's how evil this-- that's Satan coming out of the 5G.

602
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,900
 That's actually another conspiracy theory.

603
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:43,000
 I was on-- how much time have we been talking so far?

604
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
 Alright, this is gonna be-- I think I've given up time--

605
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,600
 time-- time episodes for the quarantine.

606
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,500
 I hope you guys don't mind.

607
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,200
 I was on Deadline Hollywood.

608
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,900
 Actually, it's just called Deadline now.

609
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,500
 My favorite source of entertainment news.

610
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,700
 Very storied background.

611
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,300
 Maybe I'll do an episode on that website because it's pretty interesting.

612
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,500
 But anyways, I was reading Deadline.

613
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,700
 They had an article saying Dr. Deborah Birx,

614
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,000
 U.S.-- I don't know what her actual position is,

615
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,800
 but she's always hanging out with Trump.

616
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
 She's always at his press conferences.

617
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,700
 She's a doctor.

618
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
 She's one of the head people with this coronavirus thing.

619
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,200
 She says, "For the next two weeks, don't even go grocery shopping.

620
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,900
 Don't even go to the pharmacy.

621
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,500
 Just stay at home unless you absolutely have to go.

622
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,400
 Just stay at home for the next two weeks."

623
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,300
 Reading this article-- it's on Deadline

624
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,000
 because at this point pretty much every website is talking about this stuff.

625
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,700
 I try to limit it on this show, but this is just breaking conspiracy news.

626
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,800
 Reading this article, we get to the comments and I go,

627
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 "I can't wait to read what the comments are on this one."

628
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
 "Didn't expect this."

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,200
 I expected people to take the normal political stuff.

630
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
 You know, people would be taken sides and all.

631
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,400
 So that's kind of what I expected,

632
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,500
 but it would probably just kind of have a weird entertainment slant.

633
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,000
 I don't know.

634
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
 I didn't expect this.

635
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,800
 This is a comment from someone named Anne.

636
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
 I'm going to read this the way that it's written.

637
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,000
 "What's about new videos saying all this is a cover-up

638
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,500
 from effects of implementation of 5G?

639
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,900
 China was first to get 5G.

640
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,100
 Then Italy and Spain."

641
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,300
 That's not true.

642
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,800
 I know that's not true.

643
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,100
 So you're telling me that they put 5G--

644
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,100
 Anne, this advocate of free speech,

645
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,500
 is telling me they put 5G towers in China.

646
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,700
 Everyone starts puking out blood.

647
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,400
 And then Italy goes, "You know what we need?

648
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,900
 We need some 5G."

649
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,100
 And then they have this massive death rate.

650
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,600
 And then Spain goes, "Hey, you know what?

651
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,100
 We've been missing fast cellular service."

652
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,000
 And all this stuff is going on.

653
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,400
 But anyways, so that's not true.

654
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,900
 That's not true.

655
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,900
 And even if it was true, it's all over the world now.

656
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,200
 It's in Africa.

657
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,100
 It's in Australia.

658
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,400
 They're in places where it's not 5G.

659
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,300
 But anyways, let's go back to Anne here.

660
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,900
 "China was the first to get 5G.

661
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,600
 Then Italy and Spain.

662
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
 Some caught in crossfire.

663
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 Big cities have 5G.

664
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 And after we are over with this,

665
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,500
 the vaccine will contain a chip to track people.

666
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
 New world order.

667
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 That is why stock market is down.

668
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,900
 New money will be printed.

669
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,400
 What is making us sick is the radiation from 5G.

670
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000
 All the virus is radiation kill people."

671
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 All a cover up, unquote.

672
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 So, um, that's kind of weird that she admits that 5G is cause of a radiation,

673
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,900
 but we're getting a vaccine.

674
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,400
 I guess the implication is that the vaccine will be fake.

675
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,400
 But that goes into this other conspiracy theory that Bill Gates

676
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,700
 wants to get everyone...

677
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
 Now we're getting to this New World Order anti-Christ thing,

678
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,600
 and this is the story that in the Bible,

679
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,500
 you get to a point where in the Book of Revelation,

680
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 where the anti-Christ says, "If you want to buy or sell, you must have the mark."

681
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,800
 You must have the mark.

682
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,300
 If you get the mark of the beast, you're doomed.

683
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,700
 Now this episode is really going in a weird direction.

684
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,900
 If you get the mark of the beast, you're doomed to hell.

685
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,600
 Because the mark of the beast is the complete rejection of Christ,

686
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,000
 is the story in the Book of Revelation.

687
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,100
 Now, it's be--

688
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,900
 In the 1970s, this episode is going really long, in the 1970s,

689
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,900
 there was a conspiracy theory that the barcode was the mark of the beast,

690
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,900
 because in the barcode, the number 666 appears.

691
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,400
 Apparently it was put in as a joke.

692
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,100
 So there was this idea that everyone was going to get a barcode put on their hand,

693
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,700
 and you would have to have it scanned in.

694
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,200
 Have you guys ever watched that movie, "A Thief in the Night?"

695
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 I wonder if that holds up.

696
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,800
 It was an old 1970s, late '70s, early '80s movie about the anti-Christ.

697
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,600
 Scared me to death when I was a kid, "A Thief in the Night."

698
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,800
 Because that was the thing, that was always the term,

699
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,000
 "Jesus will come like a thief in the night. You'll never know when he's coming, so be ready."

700
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,300
 It's kind of an interesting--

701
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,500
 That's from the actual Bible, "He will come like a thief in the night."

702
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,100
 That's a really evocative phrase.

703
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,200
 But anyways, and then in the '90s, it went from being a barcode on your hand to a chip.

704
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,000
 I remember when I--

705
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,700
 Because remember, I've talked about this before, it used to be really in a conspiracy theory.

706
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,200
 I 100%, I 100% believe that Bill Clinton was not going to leave office,

707
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,900
 that he was aligned with the United Nations, the Blue Troops,

708
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,500
 the Blue Helmeted Troops who were going to invade the United States.

709
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,400
 I was like 17, 18.

710
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,000
 I think the first election I could vote in was the Bob Dole--

711
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,800
 Yeah, it was, it was the Bob Dole Clinton election.

712
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,000
 Voted against Clinton, obviously.

713
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,900
 I thought he was going to take over the planet.

714
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,100
 But I 100% believed that the UN,

715
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,500
 where he was going to have the UN come into the United States,

716
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,100
 and we were going to be fostered in this one world government,

717
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,200
 and all that nonsense.

718
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,400
 And we were going to be chipped, get a little chip in your hand,

719
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,700
 because the mark of the beast is either in your right hand or your forehead,

720
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
 because not everyone has a right hand, but everyone has a forehead, right?

721
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,700
 And you're going to put a little chip in you, and it's going to use to track you,

722
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,800
 and you would have to use it to buy and sell.

723
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,500
 And then it became the RFID chip,

724
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,900
 which is in certain products.

725
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,400
 It's basically an anti-theft chip.

726
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,900
 And there are some businesses where you can have them in planets,

727
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,300
 so you could just walk through the door and things like that.

728
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
 And then the conspiracy theory became,

729
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,300
 maybe it is ocular, like, you know,

730
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,500
 they have those new things that scan your eyeball,

731
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,200
 and then it would be like some sort of like fingerprint system.

732
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,700
 I don't know.

733
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,000
 They started getting this weird biotechnology thing,

734
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,700
 and this way conspiracy theories work.

735
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,100
 They evolve over time.

736
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,400
 If people were still talking about barcodes on your hand,

737
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 you'd be like, "What?

738
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
 Why don't they use one of those little square stupid Q codes

739
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
 that you find on products that no one ever uses?

740
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,600
 Have you ever held your phone up to something

741
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,800
 that had one of those little Q codes on it?"

742
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,100
 And dude, no one ever does that.

743
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,200
 I think that's a scam.

744
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
 I think someone made it that up as a scam.

745
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,100
 But anyways, that's another conspiracy theory.

746
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,600
 The conspiracy theories evolve over time.

747
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,700
 So I went from being a barcode to a chip

748
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,600
 to a specific name chip, an RFID chip.

749
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,000
 Now the conspiracy theory is this,

750
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,600
 that Bill Gates funded a bunch of programs,

751
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,100
 which that is an conspiracy theory he actually does that.

752
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,700
 And the thing is, is that when you fund a bunch of programs,

753
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,100
 you're spreading money all over the place.

754
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,900
 One of those places eventually is going to do something

755
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,200
 that raises a couple eyebrows.

756
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
 There was a group back in 2015

757
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,300
 that wanted to study diseases and birds

758
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,100
 and develop these vaccines.

759
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,300
 So they patented, they submitted a patent for the coronavirus

760
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,200
 back in 2015 for a particular brand of coronavirus

761
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,500
 that exists in birds.

762
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,200
 They wanted a genetic manipulation on it.

763
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,500
 They got the patent in 2018.

764
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,900
 And Bill Gates happened to fund that program.

765
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,000
 Therefore, Bill Gates owns coronavirus.

766
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,700
 That's the consp-

767
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,600
 That's part of conspiracy theory number one.

768
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
 Secondly, here was the thing.

769
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,300
 He farmed it out to the Chinese.

770
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,900
 I do not believe any of this, okay?

771
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,200
 Just so we're clear, I think this is 100% nonsense.

772
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
 Just totally want to be clear.

773
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,400
 This is dumb, but...

774
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
 Bill Gates takes the coronavirus

775
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,000
 that he now owns the patent to,

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,500
 gives it to China and says,

777
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,900
 "I want you guys to make a virus

778
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,600
 that'll wipe out 20 million people."

779
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
 And China goes, "Yeah, sure, why not?"

780
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,900
 And they make that virus in Wuhan.

781
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,500
 And then they unleash it, and it sucks.

782
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,000
 Now, it is killing people.

783
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,200
 This disease, it's rough and it's bad,

784
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,800
 but it's not...

785
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,500
 It's not world-ending.

786
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,200
 So the conspiracy theory is that Bill Gates farmed it out to China.

787
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,900
 China messed it up, released it.

788
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,100
 It's not as big as he wanted,

789
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,800
 because Bill Gates wanted to have a national,

790
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,300
 and no, a global vaccine ID.

791
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,700
 So what would happen is...

792
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,200
 And he's mentioned this.

793
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,500
 I believe he's mentioned this.

794
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,700
 He's talked about vaccines,

795
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,300
 and it's really hard to tell

796
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,200
 where the conspiracy theory starts on this thing,

797
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,500
 because I think this is absolutely ludicrous,

798
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,800
 and I'm actually trying to read real news about this.

799
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
 But apparently,

800
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,500
 there's been talk of having a ultraviolet tattoo

801
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,900
 put into children's skin that lasts for five years,

802
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,000
 showing they've been vaccinated.

803
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,100
 It would basically be like an ID.

804
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:03,400
 So to know that you don't have COVID-19 or this virus,

805
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,200
 you would walk into a store,

806
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,200
 and you would scan your hand underneath the UV unit,

807
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,500
 and it would be like, "Oh, he's had the vaccine."

808
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
 Then if you go and you don't have it,

809
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,900
 they'd be like, "No. You can't eat.

810
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,500
 You can't buy or sell.

811
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,000
 Oh, I really wanted to sell today.

812
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,400
 Nope. Go."

813
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,900
 That's the conspiracy theory that's flowing around right now.

814
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,400
 But it didn't work.

815
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,000
 See, even the conspiracy theory goes,

816
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,400
 but the plan didn't work.

817
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 Bill Gates failed.

818
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
 His disease didn't kill enough people.

819
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,200
 The whole thing's ridiculous.

820
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
 There was talk of having...

821
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,900
 He did say we could have some sort of national vaccine ID thing.

822
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,800
 A digital ID is what he called it.

823
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
 And then people turned it into the tattoo.

824
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,100
 People turned it into something that was tattooed on your hand.

825
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,000
 I know for a fact that he was saying

826
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 that they didn't want to have some sort of digital ID.

827
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
 That doesn't mean that it's like, "Show your papers,"

828
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,800
 and you pull out like a holographic card

829
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
 that shows a picture of you smiling,

830
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,400
 and that means you got vaccinated.

831
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,500
 It would mean more than anything,

832
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,700
 something in your medical records.

833
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,200
 But really, this thing is going to stick around for a bit,

834
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,900
 and they'll figure out a treatment,

835
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,300
 and then they'll figure out a vaccine.

836
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,000
 That's what I knew back in January,

837
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,500
 and that's what I believe today.

838
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,700
 That it's not going to be fun,

839
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,400
 and it's here, it's really everywhere,

840
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,500
 and they'll figure out a treatment for it in the short term,

841
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,100
 and they're doing tons of work on that,

842
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,500
 and then in the long run, they'll have a vaccine.

843
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,200
 And then we will be better prepared

844
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,600
 when something like this plus E-Bolla hits,

845
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,300
 which I'm actually like, "This sucks."

846
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
 Don't get me wrong, this totally sucks,

847
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,900
 because you imagine if this was something like airborne E-Bolla,

848
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,500
 or just regular E-Bolla,

849
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,400
 at a death rate of 50%,

850
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
 and was in the water supply,

851
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,700
 or people like you could be spread through coughing or sneezing,

852
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,000
 we as a species will never take a pandemic lightly,

853
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,600
 again, or at least within the next 100 years.

854
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,900
 Because I guess we took Spanish flu,

855
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,200
 Spanish flu hit, and then 100 years went by.

856
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
 We've learned, I believe.

857
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
 The next time some disease starts popping out of some country,

858
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,600
 there's going to be strict measures taken by the world.

859
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,400
 Now, I don't think the strict measures are going to be having a digital ID,

860
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,900
 or a tattoo on your hand, or Bill Gates laughing over the whole planet

861
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,700
 with his hands on his hips as they're all bowing in front of a 5G tower.

862
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,600
 I think it'll just be people being more mindful of being clean,

863
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,400
 and as governments try to cover this stuff up,

864
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,100
 not believe them next time.

865
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,900
 Anyways, anyways, the point is, is that these conspiracy theories are flying around the globe,

866
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,600
 and they're flying really faster than the pandemic.

867
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,500
 People who have absolutely no chance of catching this,

868
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,600
 people who are at home, who are following all the social distancing things,

869
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,000
 believe this.

870
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,300
 And it's adding fear on top of fear.

871
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
 It's irresponsible and it's dangerous.

872
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,200
 Because there's also reports coming out of Britain

873
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,800
 that not only are these towers being set on fire,

874
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,300
 or just exploding according to some conspiracy theories.

875
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,100
 But if that British telecom workers are being harassed and threatened,

876
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,100
 my mailman was seek shot in the neck after 9/11,

877
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,200
 survived, thankfully, the guy went to prison.

878
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,700
 But that fear and intolerance just gets stoked

879
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,300
 when people believe in sane conspiracy theories.

880
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,300
 And 9/11 was a like one-off event that freaked everyone out.

881
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,000
 This event freaks everyone out every single day.

882
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,200
 People say things are gonna get worse before they get better

883
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,000
 as far as the coronavirus is concerned, and that's probably true.

884
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
 But as far as the conspiracy theories surrounding it,

885
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,900
 things are gonna get worse and worse and worse.

886
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,700
 And it's up to us, the people who can see through this nonsense,

887
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,300
 to make it better.

888
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,000
 You just gotta get the truth out there.

889
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,100
 Just gotta get the truth out there, 'cause this is gonna get rough, guys.
