1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Missing week continues with the trio of bizarre tales.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,600
 First off, when a professional basketball player leaves a fashion suit,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,200
 he had no idea he would be thrust into the world of human trafficking.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
 And then we travel to Japan to meet a bizarre subculture of people

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 who have made disappearing a way of life. They call themselves evaporation.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,100
 And then we meet a man.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,700
 And this story is so bizarre I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,800
 I honestly don't believe this story is real, but it keeps getting reported in the media.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,400
 And it's real.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,600
 In 1991, Romanium, a father leaves for work, gets on the train,

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,000
 and goes on a business trip like he always does.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,700
 But days pass and he doesn't come back home.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,600
 The family searches for him. The police believe he's met foul play.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,400
 The family holds a memorial service. They mourn him, then they move on with their lives.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,200
 Until two weeks ago, when their missing father came knocking on their door.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,000
 [music]

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,300
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,300
 And you'll look at the artwork for today's episode.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,900
 I got it.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,000
 It is now in my possession and nothing.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
 I'm almost ready to cancel the show honestly,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
 because I think the whole show led up to this.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
 What you are, so you're like, "Dude, Jason, I'm driving a car.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
 I can't stop to look at your cover art."

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,200
 What you are not looking at if you are driving a car is a photograph.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
 It is in my possession.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,300
 Those fingers you see are mine, ladies and gentlemen.

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,600
 That is a piece of the balloon boy balloon.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
 I own it now.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,700
 If I get enough of these cards, I can build the balloon itself.

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,900
 Now new listeners of the show are thinking, "This is utterly insane."

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,600
 But the balloon boy saga is one of those stories that I am absolutely obsessed with.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 I love the story of balloon boy and now I have possession of it.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,700
 And this would not be possible without our flying the Carpenter copter today,

38
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,100
 flying all of our vehicles today, the captain, the pilot.

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,600
 Everyone give a round of applause to SqueezeGod.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,300
 Give a round of applause to SqueezeGod.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,500
 SqueezeGod, you are going to be our pilot or captain this episode.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,800
 If you guys can't give me a piece of the story I love the most, that's fine too.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,900
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,700
 Now SqueezeGod, you're going to pilot the balloon boy balloon right now.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 We've never used this vehicle before.

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,100
 He's like, "Tang it, I want to drive like the car.

47
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,200
 I want to drive the Jason Lobby or the Jason Jett."

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,900
 We're hopping in the balloon boy balloon, maybe just for this first story.

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,400
 Let's go ahead and hop on board this thing.

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,500
 We are headed all the way out to New York City.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,900
 [Hissing]

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,400
 This is a story some of you people may be familiar with.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,800
 Because this was actually really big in the mainstream news when it came out.

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
 But it's been so long.

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,800
 I imagine some of you don't remember and some of you may have never heard this.

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,300
 But this is a story I remember reading this in the news and I go,

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,400
 "I want to know more about this."

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 And nothing else was ever said about it, which makes it even creepier.

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,900
 It was the week of August 13th, 2018.

61
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,900
 Philadelphia 76ers basketball player JJ Redick had just gotten done doing a fashion shoot

62
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,600
 with this website called MrPorter.com.

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,300
 It's like a men's lifestyle magazine.

64
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,400
 So like, "Where your jacket this way?"

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,900
 "There's a picture of a guy wearing a jacket appropriately."

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
 "You know, I like it. This is how your coupling should work."

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
 "I don't know. I don't know."

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,700
 "Shoes, cigar stuff."

69
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,200
 "Who knows? I don't read that stuff."

70
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 So anyways, he's doing there and he's like posing for pictures

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,900
 and they're like, "Who told you how to put your jacket on, JJ Redick?"

72
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,700
 He has it on backwards.

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,700
 He's like, "Oh, my mom normally dresses me. I thought I was a big boy."

74
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
 But that's why they had him in this special issue.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 "Your mom's not dressing you anymore."

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,700
 "Ten ways to look fabulous."

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,900
 He gets done with his fashion shoot.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
 And MrPorter.com...

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,800
 This is a great advertisement for this website.

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,500
 I'm sure...

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,700
 Because he has a podcast and he told the story on his podcast.

82
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,000
 And I'm sure they must have loved the fact that he name-dropped them

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,100
 several times during this legally dubious story.

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,500
 I think the story is true.

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,800
 I don't mean dubious in that way.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,900
 But if this story is true and I do believe it's true,

87
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,500
 there are some serious allegations laid out here.

88
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,100
 And I'm sure MrPorter.com is like, "Great."

89
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,400
 "Can't cancel the photo shoot with Jeff E.M.C. next week."

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,700
 "It's not gonna fly. We can't have two of these things back-to-back."

91
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,400
 JJ Porter is leaving the photo shoot.

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,400
 And he's there with his wife and his wife's sister, Kylie.

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,500
 And they were probably just hanging out at the photo shoot

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 and they were like shaking their head.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,400
 They're like, "I tried telling them how to wear that jacket."

96
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
 And Kylie's like, "Oh, my goodness."

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,100
 And they're getting ready for this ride.

98
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,700
 Now this escalade pulls up.

99
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
 Busy, busy New York streets.

100
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,700
 And then, you know, they're rich. These are rich people.

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,800
 So they don't move muscles.

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
 JJ Redick only moves muscles when he's playing basketball.

103
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,100
 The rest of the time, they have to wheel him around on like a dolly.

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,000
 So the driver gets out of the escalade and picks her bags up

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,700
 and throws them in the back.

106
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,400
 And then everyone gets into the escalade and they're like--

107
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
 He has to open the door for them.

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
 They're like, "My arms don't work unless you pay me $10,000."

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,000
 They get inside the escalade, the driver gets in,

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,700
 and they take off down the New York City streets.

111
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,800
 He gets in the car and he's explaining,

112
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,100
 because this comes into play later.

113
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
 He goes, "It didn't smell like dog food.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,300
 It didn't smell like dog poop.

115
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,700
 It didn't smell anything canine related.

116
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,200
 But it was an odd smell.

117
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
 I didn't recognize it."

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
 He doesn't really think anything of it, right?

119
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,200
 It's New York, the city of smells.

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,000
 But during the ride, Kylie taps him on the shoulder.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
 And he kind of looks over and he says,

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 when he looks over at his sister-in-law,

123
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,700
 "She is as pale as a ghost."

124
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,800
 See, it's paranormal.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,200
 It's a paranormal story.

126
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,400
 And his sister-in-law is a ghost the whole time, the end.

127
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
 She says, "Pale is a ghost."

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,800
 And she looks at him and she kind of whispers,

129
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,100
 "There's a person in the back."

130
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,000
 It kind of takes JJ Redick off guard,

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
 and he's a basketball player.

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,400
 So he knows that, being on guard.

133
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,100
 You like that sportsman?

134
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,800
 You're like, "Just tell the story.

135
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
 We know you know nothing about sports.

136
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,000
 You don't even know a position this guy played."

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Anyways, he probably plays point guard

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
 or something basketball related.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,600
 He turns and he looks into the back where their bags are,

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,100
 and he sees like a blanket in a kind of a rectangular form.

141
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
 So a blanket's covering something up.

142
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,900
 A box or a cage.

143
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,100
 And it's just kind of weird, right?

144
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,600
 So he tells the driver to pull over.

145
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,700
 "Hey, why don't you pull over?"

146
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,600
 Because the smell's weird.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,400
 And now his sister-in-law,

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,500
 there may not be a ghost at this point eating

149
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
 in much hot dogs like Slimer,

150
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,100
 but definitely saw a woman in the back.

151
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,900
 So he goes, "Pull over. Pull over."

152
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
 And as the car stops and they're getting out,

153
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,900
 he sees the blanket move.

154
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
 So he confronts the driver.

155
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,400
 He goes, "What's in the back of the car?"

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,700
 He's agitated because he says, "Listen, I don't know what's back there.

157
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,200
 For all I know, we're about to get hijacked, right?

158
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
 I'm a very successful basketball player

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
 and I got these two gorgeous women with me.

160
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
 I mean, who knows what's going to happen?

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
 So maybe we're about to get jumped."

162
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,900
 He pulls over and he asks what's in the trunk.

163
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
 So the driver gets out and he lifts the blanket,

164
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
 but the way he does it,

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,600
 he's still obstructing the view of JJ Redick.

166
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
 He can't actually see what's in the box.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And the guy's like, "Nope.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
 Nothing here in this mysterious human-sized box.

169
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,000
 Nothing."

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
 And he puts the thing down,

171
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 but they're like, "We'll just call another ride."

172
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
 And the guy's like, "Okay."

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
 And he closes the back of the escalate.

174
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,000
 He starts to walk back to the driver's side.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And then I'm going to read this,

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,200
 what he actually said on his podcast.

177
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
 "He closes the blanket back

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,400
 and then he closes the trunk.

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,000
 And as he's walking to the front seat,

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
 a head popped up."

181
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,900
 And then the guest on the show,

182
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,300
 like his co-host and stuff, start laughing.

183
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,600
 And he goes, "No, this is not funny.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
 There's a back of a female's head.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 She's blonde hair.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
 There's a ponytail.

187
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
 And based on the size of the box

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,700
 or cage that this person is in,

189
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,000
 it's like either a very small human or a child.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,900
 We all saw it,

191
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,700
 so he drives off.

192
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
 And as the car's driving away,

193
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,500
 you're incredulous, right?

194
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,200
 You don't expect there to be

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
 a human hiding in the back of a van,

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,700
 in a box with a blanket over it.

197
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,200
 Now, he asks Kylie,

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
 because they're watching this car drive away.

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,300
 He goes, "He saw the ponytail."

200
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,200
 And he goes, "Are you sure you didn't just see,

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,600
 like, the really furry tail of a dog?"

202
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,900
 And Kylie, who was the one who initially saw this,

203
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,400
 said, "Absolutely not.

204
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,100
 What I saw, I saw something move out of the corner of my eye.

205
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,600
 And when I looked, I saw the blanket was moving.

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,100
 And I saw half of the human face.

207
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,800
 I completely saw a woman's face,

208
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
 her eyes, her blonde hair.

209
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,500
 It was a woman."

210
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,300
 And J. D. Redick, doing his civic duty,

211
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,100
 calls the cops, calls the FBI,

212
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500
 called the cab company saying,

213
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,900
 "Hey, I don't know if I don't know

214
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,300
 if you're part of a human trafficking scheme,

215
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,200
 but there was a girl in a cage in the back seat."

216
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,500
 And what happened was,

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,700
 he got word later that the cab company

218
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,900
 had run an investigation,

219
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,800
 and they suspended that driver

220
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
 for having a passenger in the car in the front seat.

221
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
 "So don't worry, J. J. Redick.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,100
 This guy, he's suspended.

223
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,900
 You're not supposed to have passengers in the front seat

224
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,100
 that aren't related to the party."

225
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,600
 And J. J. goes, "It wasn't in the front seat.

226
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,700
 That wouldn't have been a problem.

227
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
 It would have been a little weird.

228
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,900
 But it wasn't in the front seat.

229
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,200
 It was in a cage in the back.

230
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,500
 And the company's like, "Well, we don't know about that."

231
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 And that's the end of the story.

232
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
 No police follow-up, no FBI follow-up,

233
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,300
 no arrest.

234
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
 J. J. Redick telling the story on his podcast.

235
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,800
 It made pretty big news,

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
 and then it disappeared.

237
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,500
 It's really creepy when, listen,

238
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,000
 I get it, it sucks that in society,

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,300
 there are social betters.

240
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,000
 It is, it's just part of human life.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
 It has nothing to do with capitalism.

242
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,200
 It has nothing to do with fame,

243
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
 or, you know, why are athletes more venerated

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 than nurses and firefighters and so forth?

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,300
 It has nothing to do with that.

246
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,400
 Every society, since the beginning of time,

247
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
 you have social betters,

248
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
 whether they're the kings or the royalty,

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,100
 or whether it's someone who's really, really good,

250
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,700
 like phenomenally good at basketball.

251
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,000
 But you would hope that

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,800
 they would be taken a little more seriously, right?

253
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,900
 Like, if I reported someone being sited

254
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,300
 in the back seat of an Uber,

255
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,700
 the police may investigate it,

256
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
 they may not, they may kind of look into it.

257
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,300
 When someone who's making millions of dollars a year

258
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,100
 leaving a high-end fashion shoot,

259
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,900
 when their word is just totally dismissed,

260
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,000
 when someone who is more powerful and has more reach,

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,700
 and even using their podcast

262
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,300
 so they have thousands or hundreds of thousands of listeners,

263
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,900
 whoever, how many people listen to it,

264
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
 and they're amplifying the story,

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,600
 and even then, nothing is done.

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,900
 That's the reason why people believe

267
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,700
 that child traffickers and stuff like that are protected,

268
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,800
 because they are.

269
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,400
 Someone had a vested interest in getting this story

270
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,100
 completely just done.

271
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
 It's possible this driver,

272
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
 he just got a stern warning,

273
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,900
 "Next time you're trafficking children,

274
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,800
 do a better job."

275
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
 It's possible that because of this mistake,

276
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,400
 he got killed, right?

277
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,300
 Who would miss a chauffeur?

278
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,500
 But this is the reason why people believe,

279
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,400
 rightfully so, that these types of networks are protected

280
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
 by the government,

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 because they are.

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,700
 And we can clearly see that with this.

283
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
 When someone randomly goes,

284
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,100
 "I think someone's running a child trafficking operation

285
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,600
 out of my neighborhood,"

286
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,900
 a lot of times they're just dismissed.

287
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,300
 Remember that story a long time ago

288
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,900
 where those people thought they found a child trafficking camp

289
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,700
 like on the border of Texas or Arizona?

290
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,400
 It was a big story for like a week,

291
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,700
 and then completely disappeared.

292
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
 And there's a couple of articles going,

293
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,400
 there's a couple of news articles going,

294
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,900
 "What? There's no proof of that?"

295
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,200
 Like dangling, there's a bunch of kids' clothes

296
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,700
 and dangling toddler shoes off of branches and stuff like that.

297
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
 What? There's no kids here.

298
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,700
 There's like Paw Patrol toys.

299
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,400
 Remember that?

300
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
 And then they just got completely scrubbed.

301
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,900
 And then this, I mean, fine.

302
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
 Those were a bunch of dudes that were like,

303
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,600
 they were like former military people

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,900
 who were like searching for,

305
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,100
 it was some weird setup and it lasted for about a week.

306
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,700
 And it's easy to scrub that.

307
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,500
 JJ Redick, multimillion dollar basketball player,

308
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,900
 even his story just kind of gets like,

309
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,400
 "Oh, isn't that wacky?"

310
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,000
 Bizarre, absolutely bizarre and scary.

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 No, I was hoping for some follow-up on that.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,700
 And even to this day, there's never been a,

313
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,100
 been an arrest.

314
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,400
 Squeeze God, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

315
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,200
 to the Jason Jalopy wrapped,

316
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,900
 wrapped in the foil from the balloon boy balloon.

317
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,300
 We are leaving behind New York City.

318
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,000
 We're going to drive all the way out to Japan.

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,700
 You actually just drive onto a ferry

320
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
 and then the ferry takes us all the way to Japan.

321
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,100
 But then you get to drive around in Japan.

322
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,000
 I found this story online.

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
 It's posted by a guy named Terry's Branding.

324
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,600
 So thank you very much.

325
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 I never heard of this story.

326
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,300
 Super interesting.

327
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
 We're driving around Japan.

328
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,100
 Japan stereotypically, when you think of Japan,

329
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,900
 you think of suicide.

330
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,400
 Jason, that's like the 10th thing that comes to my mind.

331
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
 When you think about, okay,

332
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
 when you think about depressing stuff

333
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
 with your Jason nuclear bombs, okay,

334
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
 if you think about depressing stuff,

335
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
 okay, if you think about depressing stuff

336
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,900
 that doesn't involve nuclear explosions

337
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,100
 and something you can do at home,

338
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
 something you can do on your own,

339
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,200
 depressing stuff in Japan would be suicides

340
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,000
 and you nod your head.

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,900
 You're like, "Yeah, I do think of it

342
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
 when you limit it to that much."

343
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
 Japan, people killing themselves.

344
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,800
 And this idea that it's such a stress,

345
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,900
 it seems so stressful.

346
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,800
 Like you see those photos

347
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 and you see like all them in

348
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,000
 wearing the matching business suits.

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,300
 You're all going to work in these big skyscrapers

350
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,000
 and then they go home.

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
 It's a super stressful,

352
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,600
 super post-industrial corporate lifestyle.

353
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
 And you have this idea that I just can't do it anymore

354
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 and I can't take the stress anymore

355
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
 and I kill myself.

356
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,500
 In Japan, suicide doesn't have the social stigma

357
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,900
 that it has in other parts of the world.

358
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,000
 People, it's still kind of frowned upon,

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,100
 but you understand it.

360
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,000
 It's differently than when someone kills themselves

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
 in the West.

362
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's a different mood.

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,800
 In Japan, they're like,

364
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,600
 "Well, he couldn't take it anymore.

365
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,900
 He either had to bring shame to his family

366
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,200
 or kill himself and he absolved the family of the shame."

367
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,000
 But when you kill yourself in Japan,

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,500
 you know, the government gets tired of it.

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,200
 The main people who don't want you to kill yourselves

370
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,900
 are the government

371
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,100
 because you are a taxpayer.

372
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,600
 So you kill yourself

373
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,500
 and sure it absolves your family of the shame,

374
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,000
 but the government is upset.

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,200
 So they charge the family money for it.

376
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 Now, if you do it at home,

377
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,600
 I'm not suggesting you kill yourself, right?

378
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
 But if you do it at home,

379
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,500
 then you don't have to pay anyone.

380
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,200
 But if you do it in public,

381
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,300
 they have to have a cleanup crew.

382
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,700
 Like, let's say you decide to blow your brains out

383
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 in the middle of Nordstroms in Japan.

384
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,400
 It's going to make quite the mess.

385
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,000
 So your family gets a bill for all the dresses you ruined.

386
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,500
 It's very popular to jump in front of trains.

387
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,100
 So the train stops

388
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,500
 and they got to clean the train

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
 and everyone's late for work.

390
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,400
 And you can charge for that.

391
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,500
 Your family gets charged for the disruption.

392
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,700
 So basically, you work a job that you hate

393
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,600
 and just deal with it.

394
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 You kill yourself

395
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
 and your family gets charged money,

396
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,400
 but then there's a third option

397
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,700
 and that's what we're going to be talking about today.

398
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,300
 You can become a "jo-hatsu"

399
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,500
 which means "evaporation."

400
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 I think they should call themselves the "evaporated ones"

401
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,400
 or "to the mist we return"

402
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,700
 or something really cool.

403
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,500
 But apparently, I'm not in charge of naming subcultures.

404
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 And if I was,

405
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,600
 I wouldn't know where to find these guys

406
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
 to get to-- to give them new branding.

407
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,700
 This is a real thing

408
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,600
 and it started in the 60s

409
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,800
 because you had these young men and women

410
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,200
 trapped in these completely loveless marriages.

411
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,100
 And they're sitting there

412
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,900
 and their wife's like,

413
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
 "Well, won't you believe that?

414
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,100
 The Johnsons across the street

415
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
 have a brand new lawnmower

416
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,900
 and we don't even own a lawn.

417
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,500
 We're living in this piece of crap apartment.

418
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,200
 How come you've never earned enough money?"

419
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,100
 And the guy's sitting there

420
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,500
 and he's like, "Man,

421
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,200
 he's looking at a glass of water.

422
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,500
 There's a glass of water sitting on the windowsill."

423
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,700
 And he's watching it evaporate

424
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,600
 and he's like, "I've been sitting--

425
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 I've been sitting here for a long time.

426
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,700
 If I can watch--

427
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,800
 I can watch water evaporate.

428
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
 Oh, my life sucks.

429
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,600
 When are we gonna get a lawn?

430
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,800
 When are we gonna get a ceiling?

431
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 There's birds!

432
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
 Stealing our food!

433
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,100
 Larry, are you even listening to me?"

434
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,300
 And this Japanese guy's sitting there

435
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,400
 and he's looking at this glass of water

436
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,500
 and he goes, "If only I could be like the water."

437
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,100
 So at one point,

438
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,400
 when his wife's not looking,

439
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
 he just gets up and leaves.

440
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,500
 This happened throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

441
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,200
 People instead of killing themselves

442
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
 instead of officially quitting

443
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100
 would just disappear.

444
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,800
 Japan is a relatively small country.

445
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,500
 It's very, very industrialized.

446
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
 There's not a lot of places to--

447
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Like in America, you can just go off the grid.

448
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,200
 You can grab a backpack.

449
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
 And if you know anything about the wilderness,

450
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
 you can just walk into the woods

451
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 and live there.

452
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,900
 But in Japan, you can't really do that.

453
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,400
 So where do these people disappear to?

454
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 It's actually easier to disappear in Japan

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,800
 than it would be, say, in America

456
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,100
 because they have a thing called

457
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,200
 "yanigiya."

458
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,700
 And what it is

459
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,100
 is you walk into a store.

460
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,800
 And I don't think you can buy these at Walmart, right?

461
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,500
 I don't think there's a section at Walmart.

462
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,200
 But you can go to these little stores on the corner

463
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,000
 and buy a brand new identity.

464
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,900
 The lowest level is about $450,

465
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,100
 up to $2,600.

466
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,700
 And the difference is how cool you are

467
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,400
 in your new identity.

468
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,500
 But you go there and you get all the ID cards

469
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,800
 and after the $4,500 to $2,600,

470
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 like, let's say you're like,

471
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,600
 "I would--

472
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
 One homeless person, please."

473
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
 They're like, "Well, you can do that for free,

474
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 but we're going to charge you $450.

475
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
 You're now a homeless person named Burt."

476
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
 Oh, that's sweet.

477
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
 Or you go, "I would like to be a landscaper."

478
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
 And they're like, "Well, here, do you know what they're

479
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,000
 about to be escaping?"

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
 You're like, "I'll learn on the job."

481
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,700
 They go, "That's kind of cool.

482
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,100
 So that'll be $1,000.

483
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,700
 And let's say you want to be a rock star."

484
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,200
 You're like, "Well, everyone will know

485
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,900
 if your family recognizes you

486
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
 when you're out doing concerts."

487
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,000
 "Oh, I'll be a rock star who failed."

488
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 That would be more money.

489
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
 That'd be $2,600.

490
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
 And some people do this.

491
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,100
 They bring their kids with them.

492
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,600
 So you have to buy them IDs as well.

493
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,700
 They're their backup band, your roadies.

494
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,400
 Also, the price goes up as if anyone is actively looking

495
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,100
 for you outside of your family.

496
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,500
 Like, of course, your family's going to wonder

497
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,200
 where you went because they have bills to pay.

498
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
 But if debt collectors are looking for you,

499
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,500
 that costs more as well.

500
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,700
 But what they're doing is they're purging your old identity

501
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
 and giving you a brand new one.

502
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,600
 And this business really, really boomed in the 1990s

503
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,100
 because the economy crashed

504
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,600
 and everyone was totally freaking out

505
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
 and people didn't have enough money saved up.

506
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,500
 So they just evaporated.

507
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
 There's two neighborhoods,

508
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,200
 Sanya and Tokyo and Kamagasakai in Osaka.

509
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,500
 These cities are Yakuza Run.

510
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 And there are tons of jobs there that are cash only,

511
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,100
 no ID needed,

512
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,400
 and a lot of the evaporated end up there.

513
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,100
 Because then they are really off the grid.

514
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,800
 But they're not off the grid in the sense they're worried

515
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,700
 about a bear eating them.

516
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 They just get paid in cash.

517
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,200
 And the cops don't even investigate.

518
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,500
 When someone disappears like this,

519
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,000
 in Japan it's like, okay,

520
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,700
 as long as you don't commit a crime,

521
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,800
 they're not going to investigate it.

522
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 And disappearing is not a crime.

523
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,100
 So the cops don't look into this.

524
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,400
 There's no missing person.

525
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
 There is no national missing persons database.

526
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,700
 Privacy laws in Japan are very strict.

527
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,300
 It's very hard to find people if they don't want to be found.

528
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,700
 And the only recourse is the family that they left

529
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,100
 can hire private detectives to find them.

530
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,300
 But when they find them, they can't bring them back.

531
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,800
 There is an entire subculture dedicated

532
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 to disappearing off the face of the earth.

533
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,200
 And business is booming.

534
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,900
 But we got one more story to cover.

535
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,200
 Squeeze God, I'm going to toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

536
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,000
 We are leaving behind Japan.

537
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,200
 We are headed all the way out to Romania.

538
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,600
 And I think you notice a guest appearance in the back.

539
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,300
 Falcon Heaney himself has joined us.

540
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
 He's in a cage.

541
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,700
 He's in a cage in the back of the carboner copter.

542
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
 I'm like, oops, you weren't supposed to see him.

543
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
 And I throw a blanket over him.

544
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,000
 I was like, don't worry.

545
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,400
 Do not worry about the Falcon Heaney shaped object

546
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,900
 in the back of this carboner copter.

547
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
 I'm going to see if he can fly without a balloon later.

548
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 But first off, Squeeze God's like, he's totally gone insane.

549
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
 And you are now my accomplice, Squeeze God.

550
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,000
 First off, we are headed to Romania.

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
 This story came out.

552
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
 I saw it and I thought that's not true.

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So I waited.

554
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,800
 I saw it about a week after it happened.

555
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
 And I was like, that's not true.

556
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,200
 And I waited for someone to come forward and go, oh, it's fake.

557
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,600
 You know, fake news, articles, clickbait or some viral.

558
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,400
 I can't even wrap my head around this.

559
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,000
 I first saw this pop up on Reddit.

560
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,600
 There was a user named PragyTor Dulsinois.

561
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,400
 And he posted this on Unresolved Mysteries.

562
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
 It's a pretty cool subreddit.

563
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
 I thought, whoa, that's interesting.

564
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,200
 It's not true though.

565
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
 1991 in Bukau, Romania.

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
 Vasil Gorgos.

567
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,300
 He's a cattleman.

568
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,000
 He sells cattle.

569
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,600
 And due to his job, he takes the train all over the country.

570
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,700
 And he's gone for a couple of days, each business trip.

571
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,600
 And this morning, we don't have an exact date for this story,

572
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,100
 which again, set off alarm bells.

573
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,900
 In 1991, he gets on this train.

574
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 He leaves.

575
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,200
 His family, oh, he will see you in a little bit, Vasil.

576
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 A couple of days passed, that's normal.

577
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 But a couple more days pass and they can't get ahold of him.

578
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,600
 He hasn't returned.

579
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,000
 So they contact the police and say, hey, we just want to be careful.

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,200
 You know, he's 63, he's getting up there in age.

581
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
 Something might have happened to this guy.

582
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
 The police began to investigate it.

583
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,900
 They can't find any trace of Vasil.

584
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,600
 At a certain point, the police go, this is probably foul play.

585
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,200
 We don't think that he ran off on his own,

586
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,400
 not seeing any money being used, anything like that.

587
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,100
 Foul play.

588
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,900
 But still no leads to investigate that.

589
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,700
 Time passes and the family starts to believe the worst that he's dead.

590
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,500
 They hold a memorial service for him in absentia.

591
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,100
 They move on with their lives.

592
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,800
 On a Sunday in August is the date that's given in these articles.

593
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,000
 They're all referencing this Romanian news broadcast.

594
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,300
 The date given is a Sunday in August 2021.

595
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
 So again, this happened just a few weeks ago.

596
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,800
 A car pulls up in Bacau, Romania.

597
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,100
 A car pulls up in front of a house.

598
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,600
 The same house that Vasil used to live in,

599
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,900
 the same house where his family still lives.

600
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,200
 And who steps out of that car?

601
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,400
 Vasil Gorgos, 93 years old.

602
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,300
 His daughter greets him.

603
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:57,000
 Her father, after 30 years, has finally returned home.

604
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,500
 He doesn't remember where he's been these past.

605
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,000
 And this is interesting because this is where the articles start to...

606
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,300
 All the articles agree with those facts.

607
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,500
 But when you start to look at the English translations of them,

608
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,100
 here's where we start to see some issues.

609
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,300
 I read the original Romanian articles with English translations on.

610
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,500
 And then I read two articles that were written in English,

611
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,600
 the Reddit post and then another website that translated.

612
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,900
 And there are some differences here.

613
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:27,500
 In the Romanian articles, it states that he has no idea where he's been for the past 30 years.

614
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,200
 He does not remember his children.

615
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,600
 He remembers events from before his disappearance, but nothing since.

616
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
 In his pockets.

617
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,300
 This is such a true...

618
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,000
 If this story is real,

619
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,200
 this is one of the most bizarre paranormal stories it defies logic.

620
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,500
 And it's hard for me to even think that this is real.

621
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 In this man's pockets, he's been gone for 30 years.

622
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
 And they said he appears like he's been well taken care of.

623
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,800
 Has some cognitive issues.

624
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,000
 In his pockets, this is what they find.

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,600
 His ID card, his old ID card with this address on it.

626
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,200
 And the train ticket from the day he left 30 years ago.

627
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,600
 That's...

628
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,200
 I mean, like train tickets aren't known to evaporate, right?

629
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,100
 It's not like they're made of bread.

630
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,300
 But what in the world is going on?

631
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,000
 Now, the English versions of this story say he wore the exact same clothes

632
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,900
 that he had on when he was missing.

633
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,800
 And that was one of the first things I go, "That's not true."

634
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,700
 Your body changes a lot in 30 years.

635
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,500
 Those clothes would either be extremely baggy on him,

636
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 or tight, depending on weight.

637
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,200
 I mean, like, if you...

638
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 You do not look the same as 63 as you do at 93.

639
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,300
 You may look roughly the same from, say, 40 to 60.

640
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,900
 You know, staying shape or you're out of shape or whatever.

641
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,000
 But 60...

642
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,900
 Come on, like, I was like, "Eh, I don't know about that."

643
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,000
 The Romanian articles do not say that at all.

644
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,700
 None of them say he has on the same clothes.

645
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,500
 But they do say in his pockets, or his original ID card,

646
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 and the train ticket from the day he went missing.

647
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,100
 None of the Romanian articles that I read talked about the car.

648
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
 This is interesting.

649
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
 This is where we...

650
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,800
 I think this story is interesting because, one, if it's true,

651
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,300
 it's completely insane.

652
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,800
 And two, it starts to show how the conspiracy theory community

653
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,500
 can start to change things.

654
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,200
 Small at first.

655
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,800
 But they're very impactful.

656
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,600
 One of the articles I read, one of the English articles I read,

657
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,000
 was by medium.com,

658
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,900
 which is kind of a website anyone can post stuff on.

659
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,600
 But they were saying that the people who saw him showed up

660
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,500
 saw the car drop him off, but they didn't get a good look at the driver

661
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,100
 and the car sped away and they couldn't get a look at the license plate.

662
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,000
 None of that stuff is in any of the Romanian articles.

663
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,300
 That seems to be complete fiction.

664
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 I think the English writer who was writing it for medium goes,

665
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,700
 "Oh, I wonder what happened to the car?"

666
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,400
 And then said, "Well, it must have sped off."

667
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,800
 Type, type, type, type, type, type.

668
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 And that article, because it's in English, is going to get more play

669
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,400
 than these articles that you have to run Google Translate on,

670
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,500
 and things like that.

671
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,700
 So that's an added detail.

672
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,900
 It doesn't really add much, but a layer of mystery that may not appear there.

673
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,400
 They may have, it could have been a taxi who dropped him off,

674
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,700
 and they may have known the guy or not.

675
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,300
 We don't know.

676
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
 It's not even detailed in the Romanian articles.

677
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,800
 But when you start changing information like that,

678
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,300
 seems like he was wearing the exact same clothes as the day he disappeared.

679
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,100
 That is not repeated anywhere else.

680
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,900
 That makes it way more fantastical than him having new clothes on.

681
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
 But this is interesting.

682
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,100
 It doesn't have to be fantastical because the story itself is so bizarre.

683
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,200
 He has the same train ticket as the day he disappeared.

684
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
 What?

685
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,400
 I mean, I get it.

686
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,300
 Some people scrapbook, and some people will save stuff for a long time.

687
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,400
 In your pocket?

688
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,900
 You have a scrapbook in your pocket when you get abducted?

689
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,400
 Or who, where did he go?

690
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,300
 When I saw this story pop up, I go, "It's fake.

691
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,900
 It has to be viral marketing for something.

692
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,700
 It doesn't make sense."

693
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,000
 And it wasn't until I started reading the Romanian articles,

694
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 I go, "Oh, some of the details that I thought were fantastic,

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,400
 like the car speeding away, like him wearing the same clothes,

696
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,300
 those aren't present in those articles."

697
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,900
 But then they offered up more questions like, "We don't have exact dates.

698
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,300
 If this guy really went missing and really reappeared."

699
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,700
 In recent times, just a couple weeks ago, instead of saying a Sunday in August,

700
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,800
 they should have given us the week of the 13th or the week of the 2nd or whatever.

701
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,600
 At least that.

702
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,200
 Absolutely.

703
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,700
 If this story is true,

704
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,800
 it's one of the biggest missing persons mysteries of recent time.

705
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,400
 This I would put on the case of D.B. Cooper.

706
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,100
 A man disappears for 30 years and then just reappears one day.

707
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,800
 So I wanted to share this with you and I'm hoping it's true.

708
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,200
 Right?

709
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,300
 I mean, wouldn't that be amazing?

710
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,500
 I, in the back of my head, I'm thinking this is some sort of viral stunt.

711
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,000
 Or it was a mistaken.

712
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,200
 Or maybe even if he regains his memory and he goes,

713
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,900
 "Oh, sorry about that."

714
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,800
 I went, even if it's a mundane explanation, he goes,

715
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,000
 "Oh, I left the family and I did this and then I must have got bonked on the head."

716
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And then he brought me back here.

717
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,700
 Even if it's something mundane like that, that is more interesting than it just being fake.

718
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,800
 But I mean, this story opens, I mean, obviously you're thinking of paranormal stuff,

719
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,400
 portals, alternate dimensions, alien abduction, to stuff like human trafficking.

720
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,100
 Was he kidnapped?

721
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,100
 Was he taken to some Sultan's palace and spent the last 30 years entertaining some Saudi Arabian

722
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,400
 prints and they go, "You're not funny anymore.

723
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,200
 Now that you're 93, you're funny up until 92."

724
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
 They bonked him on the head and dropped him back.

725
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,700
 Who knows?

726
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
 Who knows?

727
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,100
 But I saw this story and I wanted to share it with you.

728
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,800
 Weeks ago and I said, "No, something has to come out about this story.

729
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,300
 It has to be fake."

730
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,700
 And just time has passed and I kept looking and nothing's changed.

731
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,900
 This story is jaw-droppingly weird.

732
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:31,400
 I have no, I can't even put into words how bizarre this is, if it's true.

733
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,600
 So we're hoping, right?

734
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 Hoping that this story is accurate and it's not some sort of viral stunt.

735
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:50,000
 Truly, truly, a bizarre story involving a man who goes missing and then comes back.

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,700
 Where was he?

737
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,200
 Why did he leave?

738
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
 Why doesn't he remember?

739
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,500
 Him returning actually causes us to ask more questions than if he had just disappeared in the first place.

740
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,800
 Unfortunately, people disappear all the time.

741
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:16,600
 So stay tuned because this story is either going to be exposed or it's just going to get even more bizarre.
