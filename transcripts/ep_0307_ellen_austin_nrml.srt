1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
 Does a massive entertainment franchise have a connection to one of the worst crimes possible?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,540
 And then we continue Halloween month with the spooky tale of the Ellen Austin.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,960
 When this ship set sail from London to New York in 1880, it was supposed to be a routine

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,820
 journey and the journey was normal until they ran into a ship that devoured all hope today

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:40,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,280
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today so we're gonna get started with the Patreon.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,700
 I got a new Patreon just this morning.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,200
 Matthew McKenzie.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,440
 Matthew McKenzie hit me up right as I was getting ready to record this episode.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,160
 I really appreciate the support from all of you guys.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,160
 It really really means a lot.

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
 It means a lot.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 You guys remember Spuds McKenzie?

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 You remember that?

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,880
 Did he talk or was it just a dog with spuds?

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,120
 I don't know how old you are Matthew, but if you were my age you probably would have

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,200
 gotten called Spuds in school.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,720
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on with our first story of the day.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,640
 So for our first story, we're going to go to Canada.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,760
 Put on your parkas and your hiking boots.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 We're walking there.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
 We're just gonna go on a big old nature hike.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,080
 We're gonna be chasing butterflies and like punching squirrels, collecting cactus and

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
 then taking it back to the desert.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
 It shouldn't be in the forest dude.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
 Stay where you belong Mr. Cactus.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,840
 And as we move through the forest, why are we in the forest?

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
 We're on, okay.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,520
 We walk along the highways.

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,960
 The point is is that we get to Toronto.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,320
 So we go into Toronto, we're catching the sights, we're putting cactuses down in funny

35
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,720
 places, putting them under park benches.

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 It's not funny.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,640
 No one's gonna sit on a cactus under a park bench.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,960
 We're putting them where we're putting them in locker rooms.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
 So why are we doing anything with you?

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,560
 The point is is that we're in Toronto, Canada.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,640
 And so we're in Toronto to meet the law enforcement officers of the child exploitation section.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,480
 So this story is a little rough guys.

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,880
 But anyways, has a weird twist to it.

44
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,320
 And as we're walking around, we're, "Hey, oi, matey, I'm from Canada.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
 Thank you.

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,560
 I'm shaking your hands guys."

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
 And then the cop leads us away.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,960
 Not to a jail cell leads us to give us a tour of his facility.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,360
 And we're looking around and we're like, "Oh, you know, it's mostly computers because they

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,880
 have to deal with a lot of horrible stuff on the internet."

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,560
 But you go into one room and there's a giant poster.

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,080
 And it's a picture of the original cast of the Star Trek television show.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,040
 So Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scotty, and the Russian dude, Vlad.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,320
 And so we go, "Hey, that's kind of weird.

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
 Like why do you have..."

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,880
 Oh, no, I didn't finish describing the poster.

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,280
 So it's not just a poster of the Star Trek crew.

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,160
 That would just be kind of out of place for the child exploitation section.

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,760
 They're like, "Oh, we're huge fans."

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,880
 No, I didn't finish describing the poster.

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,160
 The poster then has the faces of each cast member replaced with a photograph of the officers

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,560
 working in the child exploitation section.

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,840
 So this actually happened.

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,000
 There was a reporter who was covering this group saw the poster and goes, "Why do you

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,920
 have that poster there with your faces on those people?"

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,520
 And the cop goes, "This was huge news when this came out.

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,600
 I don't remember how many of you people...

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
 I remember this being really big news."

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,360
 Now, this happened back in 2005.

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,200
 So the nerd sphere of the internet wasn't super entrenched.

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,880
 You didn't have gizmodo or all those other websites that are just fueled by geek culture.

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
 That's all they do.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,240
 It's like 24/7 about Dick Grayson is dead or something like that.

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,080
 I get these alerts all the time because once I clicked on a link and now they think that

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,760
 I always want to know about what's happening in Batman comic books, which to be fair, I

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 do.

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,080
 But I get stuff for all sorts of stupid geek nonsense, Game of Thrones and those bobblehead

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 toys.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,600
 I've never bought one of those.

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,560
 Why am I getting alerts that there's a new one of those?

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
 Anyways, geek culture 24/7.

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,360
 So this was before all that.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,200
 So it kind of popped up in traditional newspapers.

84
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,840
 It was a bit online and then it kind of died.

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
 And then it popped back up a little bit later, but let me get...

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
 I'm building it up.

87
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,960
 So what happened was the law enforcement officer goes, "It's really weird.

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,920
 We've kicked down the doors of a lot of child molesters and child pornographers to be specific.

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,160
 We've arrested over 100 offenders in four years.

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,280
 And only one of them did not have a bunch of Star Trek the original series merchandise

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,560
 all over their house."

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,920
 And the reporter's like, "What?"

93
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,040
 And the dude's like, "It's weird.

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
 Trust me, it's weird.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,480
 And I can't figure out why it is, but it's not the next generation.

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,920
 It's none of the other series.

97
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,880
 It's the original series and there'll be like toys and posters and stuff like that.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
 It's such a bizarre connection, but it's there.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
 We don't know what causes it."

100
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,520
 One of the quotes was, "This was Detective Constable Warren Bulmer.

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,200
 It has something to do with a fantasy world where mutants have power and where the usual

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
 rules don't apply.

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,160
 But beyond that, I can't really explain it."

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
 And that doesn't...

105
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,320
 That's not a kind of not a good description of Star Trek.

106
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,440
 I have my own theories of what could cause it, but one of the...

107
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,840
 This was from the Huffington Post article I read about it.

108
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,700
 They said, "The characters in Star Trek as sexual as like Captain Kirk is, he never forms

109
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,280
 real connections with any of the adults around him.

110
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,480
 Like he has a connection with Spock and Bones, but like a romantic relationship.

111
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
 It only lasts an episode and then he's gone.

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,600
 There's no long-term relationship goal for him."

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,480
 And they said, "That appeals to a pedophile.

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,720
 They're not looking for a long-term goal.

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,800
 They're looking for a short-term fix.

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,000
 And they're seeing people who's just moving from conquest to conquest to conquest."

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,800
 They also said the show is fairly sexually sterile as well.

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,980
 There's a lot of like shirt ripping and kind of making out, but there's not a lot of like

119
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,460
 real sexuality in it.

120
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,980
 I mean, the show was from 1960s, what do you expect?

121
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,580
 Another thing was that any sort of fantasy world has generally a world with no rules,

122
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,580
 where there's no boundaries, where people are kind of making things up as they go.

123
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,900
 And as a reader, you're going on this journey where you know the next episode there is a

124
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,740
 brand new thing happening.

125
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,340
 So there's no rules, there's nothing going on.

126
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,220
 But the thing is, is that because people go, "Well, did they find other fantasy stuff there?

127
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,700
 Was there other sci-fi stuff?"

128
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,520
 Because people started asking after this article came out, originally came out in the LA Times

129
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,440
 back in 2005, got a lot of phone calls to this section.

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 And at first they started saying, "Well, I was kind of misquoted, but it's true.

131
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,180
 Like yes, I didn't say exactly what I said, but there is a connection."

132
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,280
 And so that caused even more phone calls and like, "Well, what about Battle Circle Act?

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
 What about this?"

134
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,720
 And they said, "Listen, we don't know why this is.

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 We have no idea."

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,340
 And yes, you would go to a house where they would have a bunch of Tron action figures,

137
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,500
 but they would still have the Star Trek stuff.

138
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,700
 Like, that was the one constant across all things.

139
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
 It really is a bizarre connection.

140
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,900
 What is there, the first thing is, is there a connection between the two?

141
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,340
 100, arrest, only one person wasn't a Star Trek fan.

142
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,120
 That seems a little, like, that seems like a connection.

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,340
 And what's intra, and you will see these things with people in crime.

144
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,800
 There's an, I've had, I've read this book called The Collector.

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,320
 And if you're a serial killer in the 70s or 80s, if cops were, like, doing a case and

146
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,360
 they're like, "Oh, this guy's killed three women, da-da-da-da-da."

147
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,000
 They're on the hunt for these serial killers.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,400
 They would turn to their partner and go, "What do you want to bet?

149
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,480
 He has a copy of The Collector."

150
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,600
 Other officers like, "I'm not taking that bet."

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,620
 Because every serial killer has a copy of The Collector.

152
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,920
 And that was another common theme.

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,960
 You would run into these serial killers.

154
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
 You'd finally break their door down with a sledgehammer, put a gun to the back of their

155
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
 head and they're under arrest.

156
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
 And then when you're combing the scene for evidence, you find a copy of the book, The

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 Collector.

158
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,760
 The Collector, so of course I was like, "I gotta read this book."

159
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,120
 I had read a lot of true crime novels that talked about The Collector.

160
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,000
 It being in someone's collection.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,640
 And so I went and got the book and it's, I recommend reading it.

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's a really fascinating book.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,080
 It's a story of a man who caneps a woman, he's a butterfly collector, and then he wants

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
 to collect a woman.

165
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,560
 So he caneps this woman and puts her in his basement.

166
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,920
 This came out like in like mid-70s, maybe late 60s.

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,360
 Caneps a woman puts her in the basement.

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,720
 The book is broken up into two parts.

169
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,240
 The first part is the killer trying to, it's a first person narrative, the killer trying

170
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,620
 to break the woman.

171
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,800
 The second part is a first person narrative from her point of view, how she's dealing

172
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,960
 with being quote unquote broken.

173
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,880
 It's a fascinating book and I can almost guarantee anyone who reads that book and then inspires

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,000
 to become a serial killer doesn't finish the book.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,840
 Because the second part is extremely powerful.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
 Because you read the first book and you're like, "Whoa, what a horrible situation this

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 woman's in."

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
 You're reading the second part and you're like, "Whoa, what a horrible situation this woman's

179
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 in."

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,480
 But all of the stuff that she's going through and the tricks she's playing in the mental

181
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
 is really, really good book.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's like 90 pages long.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,760
 I would check out The Collector, but let's go ahead and actually move on to my Dead Rabbit.

184
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,240
 That was my book recommendation.

185
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,920
 I want to do 31 Dead Rabbit Recommends this month.

186
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,120
 I want to give you something to watch each spooky day of spooky, spooky Halloween.

187
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,080
 Today's movie that I want to talk about very briefly, I actually was recommended to me

188
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 by Carson.

189
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,400
 He's a listener of the show.

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,640
 He supports the Patreon as well.

191
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
 He's a friend of mine in real life.

192
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
 I should have said that first.

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,760
 A young starlet, she's not even a starlet.

194
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,080
 A young woman is in LA.

195
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,680
 She wants to be a star more than anything.

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
 She wants to make it in Hollywood.

197
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 She's living at a house with like five of her friends.

198
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
 They're all young, beautiful people.

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,600
 And she just can't land the right role.

200
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,840
 No matter what she does, she just can't get a break until she meets a casting director

201
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,480
 and everything spins out of control.

202
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,080
 The movie's called Starry Eyes.

203
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,480
 Now right there you're like, "What is this?

204
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,360
 You're recommending me to watch some drama?"

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,280
 This movie is about Illuminati, Satan worshippers controlling the movie industry, dark forces

206
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,160
 behind your favorite actors.

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,360
 It's a really, really good horror movie.

208
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,200
 Again, fairly low budget.

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
 It looks beautiful.

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 It's beautifully shot.

211
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,000
 Fairly low budget, messes with your head a couple times.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,400
 You start to wonder, is she really hallucinating all this stuff and she's gotten too far into

213
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,560
 the internet and believes all these stupid conspiracy theories or are these things actually

214
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,880
 going on?

215
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,520
 Starry Eyes, that's my recommendation for today.

216
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
 Check it out.

217
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 Really, really good movie.

218
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,840
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

219
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,440
 Just like how I want to have a Dead Rabbit recommend every day, I want to have one spooky

220
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 story for you every day.

221
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,520
 The pedophile story is just disgusting, but this story is actually spooky.

222
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
 So we're leaving Toronto.

223
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,200
 We walk to the ocean and then we just walk into the water.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
 And now I'm swimming in my scuba set.

225
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,680
 Oh, you don't have your Dead Rabbit license scuba set?

226
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
 Sorry, bro.

227
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,800
 And you're splashing around and I'm like, "Ah, fine.

228
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 I'll go swim back."

229
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,200
 You're going to share my oxygen tank.

230
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,160
 I'm going to take a couple extra breaths though.

231
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 I'm going to be like, "Ah."

232
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,200
 And then I'll give it to you and you go, "Ah."

233
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 And I just take it back and go, "Ah."

234
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,640
 Because you know, I got to survive longer, right?

235
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,760
 So anyways, we're swimming in our Dead Rabbit diving suit, Dead Rabbit diving suit.

236
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,520
 I don't think you want to name a diving suit after dining.

237
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,720
 I don't think you want to name any of our vehicles after stuff like a Dead Rabbit dirgible.

238
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,120
 You don't want the word "dead" in your vehicle.

239
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,720
 But anyways, Dead Rabbit diving bell, isn't that like that giant?

240
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,280
 We're not even under water in this story.

241
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,240
 Okay, so anyways, we get onto the Dead Rabbit robot.

242
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
 Well, I'll help you onboard.

243
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,920
 I don't know why we're going deeper into the ocean.

244
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,880
 Dead Rabbit robot, we're rowing to the year 1856.

245
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,560
 But we're just rowing to New York.

246
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
 So we're just kind of doing a loop.

247
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,640
 And we go into New York City.

248
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
 We grab a newspaper.

249
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
 We're reading this article.

250
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,400
 This was printed in 1856.

251
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,640
 This was in the New York Tribune.

252
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,560
 This was printed in the February 19th edition of New York Tribune 1857.

253
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
 Reading this article, right?

254
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,920
 And there we tell the story about this boat called the Ellen Austin.

255
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,480
 And this guy says, "Okay, here's what happened.

256
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,440
 I worked on the Ellen Austin and I slept past the breakfast bell, the morning meal bell.

257
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:42,320
 And the crew member slept past it.

258
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
 So I heard you slept past the morning meal bell.

259
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,040
 And he's like, "I did, but is that a big deal?"

260
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,520
 And he's like, "Yeah, that's a big deal on my boat."

261
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,120
 They throw a blanket over his head so no one can hear him scream, begin hitting him with

262
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,320
 a giant metal rope.

263
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,280
 And then the captain goes, "Sick 'em, boys.

264
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
 And attack dogs.

265
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,680
 Attack this guy on a boat and bite his legs up."

266
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,120
 He's like, "Oh, next time we'll hear the bell, I promise."

267
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
 And they just bite his legs up.

268
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,840
 Captain's like, "Good.

269
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,920
 As you can see on my boat, the punishment fits the crime."

270
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,720
 He may go and he's like, "Uh, he hobbles out of the ship."

271
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
 And then he's instructed to show all the other crew members his legs.

272
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,400
 Now, it's 1856.

273
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
 This isn't 1492.

274
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 One.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,800
 There are passengers on this boat.

276
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,920
 This boat, the Ellen Austin was called a "package ship."

277
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
 So it would have a regular route.

278
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
 It would go from London to New York, London to New York.

279
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,640
 And it would move passengers, material, mail, stuff like that.

280
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,040
 So other people are like, "Oh, man, that was a really good breath fix.

281
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
 I really like it.

282
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
 I mean, that was a really good morning meal.

283
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
 Sorry, Jason."

284
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,360
 And I really like those eggs.

285
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,280
 And then you see some guy with like bloody legs come out and goes, "This is what happens

286
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,520
 when you don't come to the morning meal bell."

287
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,120
 12 days later.

288
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,960
 Okay?

289
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,120
 His same dude is jumping down off of like a mast or something.

290
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
 He's like, "Whoopie!"

291
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,280
 He's like, "Oh, playing arrow fling."

292
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,800
 He's jumping off of this mast and he lands on the boat's swaying foot and falls down.

293
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,600
 And the boat's swaying goes to the captain and says, "I was just doing my boat's swaying.

294
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,160
 This guy jumped on top of me and hurt me."

295
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,920
 The captain goes, "Bring him to me."

296
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,840
 So the dude hobbles in.

297
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,200
 Legs are all still messed up.

298
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
 Captain goes, "So I heard you attack this guy."

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,720
 He's like, "I didn't attack this guy.

300
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
 I didn't attack the carpet."

301
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,080
 So they throw a carpet over him, beat him with the wire again, end up like bashing up

302
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 his head.

303
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,400
 And then the captain goes, "Sick of him, boys."

304
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
 And he gets attacked by dogs again.

305
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,000
 Eventually the boat docks in New York.

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 He jumps out.

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Not literally.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He has to crawl out.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,760
 He said after this, the only job he could do was steering the boat.

310
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
 That's because he couldn't move.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,880
 And he reports a story.

312
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,320
 And the Ellen Austin, there was this quote from the New York Times.

313
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,480
 It says, "The officers of the Ellen Austin have a very unenviable notoriety for alleged

314
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,240
 cruelty to their men, and that the vessel has scarcely ever entered port without complaints

315
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,200
 being made in our police courts against them for cruel and inhuman treatment."

316
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,600
 And people still worked for this boat and wrote it because they're like, "Oh, I really

317
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 need to get back to London."

318
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,520
 And you think, "Okay, it's the crews getting attacked by dogs."

319
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,200
 1859, this passenger lands in New York and says, "You won't believe what happened to

320
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
 me."

321
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,720
 And they're like, "Let me guess, you were on the Ellen Austin passenger."

322
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,160
 Just like, "How did you know?"

323
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,720
 So this passenger, not a crew member, is on the boat.

324
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,600
 Some officers on the boat, they tie his arms and his legs down.

325
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,880
 So basically they rope him up.

326
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,360
 And then they began, quote, "Rolling him along the deck like a bale of goods."

327
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
 A passenger.

328
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,640
 They just rope up and they're like, "Weee, they're playing shuffleboard with a life

329
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
 human being on the boat."

330
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,360
 And then they just untie him and he goes and complains.

331
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,760
 So the reason why I'm telling you that stuff is, one, the Ellen Austin had a long history

332
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,120
 of just bizarre and cruel behavior.

333
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,320
 And two, because the comings and goings of the Ellen Austin are actually very, very detailed.

334
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,080
 Loids of London had to insure all these goods so we know when the boat was leaving London

335
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,840
 ahead of New York and vice versa.

336
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,160
 So every time this ship docked, there's a record of it.

337
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,840
 And every time the ship docked, someone jumped off and said, "Hey, I was just on that boat

338
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,960
 and they punched me in both eyes and it had dogs chase me around for like 10 minutes."

339
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,600
 That's what makes this following story even more intriguing.

340
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,200
 December 5th, 1880.

341
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,680
 The Ellen Austin leaves London, headed towards New York like it normally does.

342
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,880
 At this time it's being captained by AJ Griffin, who's a different captain than the dude who

343
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,920
 was doing all that stuff.

344
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,520
 But it still had a really bad reputation as far as a boat goes.

345
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,120
 People still didn't really like working on the boat.

346
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
 They had to pay people more.

347
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
 December 5th, 1880, it leaves London.

348
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,160
 And as they're coming across the ocean, they see an unidentified schooner, schooner, schooner

349
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
 boat.

350
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
 It's another boat.

351
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:02,880
 They see another boat drifting listlessly in the sea in front of them and they go, "Pirates."

352
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,960
 That ship doesn't look damaged at all.

353
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
 Has to be a trap.

354
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,040
 So the captain ordered that the Ellen Austin just kind of keep distance for a while and

355
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 watch it.

356
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,680
 And then after two days they watched this boat.

357
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,680
 No sign of life on board, just drifting there.

358
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,000
 After two days the captain goes, "Okay, let's go and see what's going on with this boat."

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
 So they come up alongside the boat, put down their gangplank.

360
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,440
 I don't know if that's what it's called.

361
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
 And they walk over.

362
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
 Actually no, they didn't do that.

363
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
 They got on a rowboat.

364
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,920
 Now they remember it and they rode over to it and they started inspecting it.

365
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,760
 No crew, no bodies, no sign of violence.

366
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,960
 The captain's log was missing.

367
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,000
 The name plates off the bow were missing.

368
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,640
 But inside the hold was a giant shipment of mahogany.

369
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,840
 So at that point the captain's eyes are like, "A-roo-ga, a-roo-ga."

370
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,920
 He's like, "The ship alone is worth a lot of salvage, but this mahogany, this is worth

371
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,160
 so much money."

372
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
 Salvation rights.

373
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
 We've got to get this ship.

374
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,800
 He says, "Let's get my best crew over to that ship and we're going to take them both

375
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 to New York."

376
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,240
 One of the articles, I got a lot of this information from an awesome website called Something

377
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,400
 Interesting.

378
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,760
 And they said, "To be fair, the best crew would still be on the Ellen Austin."

379
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,200
 So it was probably his B team.

380
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
 But still, you got a good crew over there, send some people over there, and they're just

381
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,880
 going to take both ships back.

382
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,560
 And for about two days, both ships are sailing, everything's fine.

383
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,840
 And then out of nowhere, which is really how everything happens in the ocean, massive

384
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,760
 storm hits.

385
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,880
 You're getting tossed around.

386
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 Their human shuffleboard game gets interrupted.

387
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
 They're like, "Oh no, we have to go inside."

388
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,880
 The dude's like, "Are you going to untie me?

389
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,380
 Are you going to untie me?"

390
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,880
 Captain's like, "Sick 'em boys, dogs are on, tie in the ropes."

391
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,440
 The passenger goes back.

392
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,520
 Storm lasts for two days.

393
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,760
 So there's no communication between the ships at that time.

394
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,320
 But after two days, storm clears.

395
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
 The other ship is gone.

396
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,000
 They don't see it anywhere.

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,920
 They're like, "Did they get..."

398
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,320
 They must have got blown away by the storm.

399
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,680
 It'll come back.

400
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
 But they go, "We got to find that ship.

401
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
 We got to find our crew.

402
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,480
 We got to find all that sweet, sweet mahogany."

403
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,680
 And so, and they're doing this search for a while, and eventually they see like right

404
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,400
 over by the horizon, the tip of the ship.

405
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,520
 They're like, "There they are.

406
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,920
 It takes them eight hours to..."

407
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,640
 Now that they found them, it takes them eight hours to get to the boat.

408
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,200
 When they get there, it's just drifting.

409
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,600
 Captain's like, "Okay, he wants a volunteer to go on board this time."

410
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,960
 But they do need to go on board.

411
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,080
 They need to find out what happened.

412
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,440
 They need to find out if their crewmen are okay.

413
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,960
 So they hop in a blue rowboat, row over, climb on board.

414
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,440
 Ships completely empty.

415
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,440
 The bunk beds haven't even been slept in.

416
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,720
 The captain's log that was put there to replace the one that was missing is now also gone.

417
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,680
 But it's still full of that sweet mahogany wood.

418
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,200
 So Captain's like, "We got to get a new crew over here."

419
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,400
 Nobody wanted to do it.

420
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
 They go, "That ship's cursed."

421
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,160
 He's like, "We need that stuff.

422
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,800
 This ship is salvageable.

423
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 We can do this."

424
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,000
 Took him quite a few hours to convince another crew to go over there.

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,840
 And he said to tell you what, you guys can bring whatever you want.

426
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
 Bring your weapons.

427
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 Bring that dude over.

428
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,840
 He plays a little shuffleboard.

429
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,560
 Totally cool.

430
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,480
 What you need, whatever you need to feel safe, you can go over.

431
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,040
 And also he must have promised them a lot of money because eventually he did get another

432
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,200
 crew of people to go over there, which at this point we're probably at his sea team.

433
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,840
 Not definitely not the best of the best.

434
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,600
 So this other crew goes over there and the captain says, "We will stay within 10 boat

435
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
 lengths of you.

436
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,760
 We're not going to lose sight of you.

437
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 We're not going to be popping wheelies.

438
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,080
 We're not going to be doing anything fun.

439
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 We're going to take two boats.

440
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,160
 We're just going to sail them straight.

441
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,240
 We'll be right behind you."

442
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,280
 The other guys are like, "Fine."

443
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,520
 Day passes.

444
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
 No storm.

445
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,320
 And then one day when the sea is perfectly calm, because they're over this place called

446
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,480
 the Sargosa Sea.

447
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,640
 It's in the Atlantic Ocean where the seaweed is so thick the wind doesn't make the water

448
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
 break.

449
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 It's just a flat area.

450
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,280
 They said the only breaks that you see in the water at the Sargosa Sea is derelict ships

451
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,640
 because the ship will sink there and there's no current or anything to move it away.

452
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,080
 So it just sits there.

453
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,760
 You've reached this graveyard of boats, but you've got to go through it.

454
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
 You're leaving from London to New York, New York to London.

455
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,760
 So they're within 10 boat lengths.

456
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,720
 The sea is perfectly calm and then fog.

457
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,360
 Thick is peace, Sue.

458
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
 Captain.

459
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,640
 I see that matey.

460
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,680
 Apparently, it's pirate day on my ship.

461
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,400
 Let's talk like normal humans.

462
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
 We're not pirates.

463
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,880
 I forgot that for a second.

464
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,680
 Thick fog moves in and neither ship can see each other at this point.

465
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,080
 Just everyone on the Elan Austin is very, very nervous at this point.

466
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,080
 But eventually the thick fog dissipates.

467
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,280
 And the guy working the lookout for the Elan Austin goes, "She's gone, Captain."

468
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,920
 And all around them is just calm sea.

469
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,440
 The boat was never seen again.

470
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,400
 Now this story was reported in 1906.

471
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,040
 The first time it was reported was in 1906 in the Daily Deadwood Pioneer Times.

472
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,440
 Tell me that doesn't sound like a rootin toot newspaper.

473
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,520
 It comes with bullet holes shot through each issue.

474
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,880
 But really that story had been going around for the previous 15 years from sailor to sailor.

475
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,680
 It was already an old story that sailors told each other about the Elan Austin.

476
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,880
 The ship was very famous for its infamous activities.

477
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,840
 So sailors knew the name of the boat.

478
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,600
 But they would tell this story about this missing ship that swallowed up two crews.

479
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,040
 It was after that article in the newspaper, and that was a newspaper, after that article

480
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,360
 it would come in and out.

481
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,840
 It was published in a couple other accounts and then it was really made famous in the 1940s.

482
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,960
 There was a radio show that was like weird news.

483
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,600
 It was like the original art bell from the 1940s.

484
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
 Imagine ragtime music or jazz music or whatever garbage they listened to back then.

485
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
 And a dude named Lieutenant Colonel Rupert T. Gold.

486
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 Talk about weird news.

487
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,640
 He told this story on his radio show too and that made it extremely popular at the time.

488
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,680
 That whole time period from after the boat docked in 1881.

489
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
 Because see we have the records.

490
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
 I'll get to that in a second.

491
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,800
 But after the boat docked in 1881 till really today, I'm sure sailors still talk about this

492
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,080
 story, but definitely they were talking about it long before it became part of the public

493
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,320
 consciousness.

494
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,440
 So there's a lot of interesting facts to this story and there's some myths.

495
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,240
 Obviously one of the biggest, the first thing you want to know is we have all these documents

496
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
 about this boat.

497
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,240
 Are there any reports of crew missing from this boat during that journey?

498
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,920
 No, there aren't.

499
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,280
 If you have a boat and people die in your boat, you have to list it.

500
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,880
 Lost sea, you have to list it.

501
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,640
 It's all for insurance purposes.

502
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,360
 But we do know that the boat left on December 5th, 1880 and it arrived in New York in February

503
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,080
 11th, 1881.

504
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,920
 Which is apparently back then an unusually long amount of time.

505
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,160
 It shouldn't have taken that long for that boat to reach New York.

506
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,760
 So the idea is the boat was delayed in some way.

507
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,640
 Not just a storm, not just a two or three day storm.

508
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,520
 But the conclusion is that if a boat was constantly chasing another boat trying to find it, then

509
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,600
 that could take a while.

510
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,160
 As you say, it was just eight hours for them to go from where they were out to find the

511
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
 boat the second time.

512
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,280
 Well they took two days off to wait for the boat.

513
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,760
 And it took them a good period of time to even see the boat off the horizon the first

514
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
 time it disappeared.

515
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,920
 It took them eight hours to get over there, but it took them a while.

516
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,240
 They were just sailing around hoping to find it.

517
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,560
 So the idea is the reason why the journey took longer is because of that.

518
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,520
 Why there are no casualties listed in this report.

519
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,320
 If I think about four men were sent over each time, four to six men were sent over each

520
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 time.

521
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
 If you lost eight to twelve dudes, why isn't that reported?

522
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,920
 A little bit of a hole in the story.

523
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,400
 Also as the story kept getting reported later on when the radio show popped up, he changed

524
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,280
 the name of the captain and he changed.

525
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,080
 Boat was renamed from the Ellen Austin to the Metta.

526
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,400
 And on the radio show he kept talking about the Metta and people think that was just a

527
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,680
 research error because before the radio show was always known as the Ellen Austin during

528
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
 the story.

529
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
 So there are some discrepancies.

530
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,880
 Some people say it was on its way to Newfoundland.

531
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,360
 So there are some discrepancies, but when you look at the very first reported incident

532
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 of it, a little news article in the Daily Deadwood Pioneer Times, it matches pretty much all

533
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 the details that we know today.

534
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,720
 They've said, "Oh, the radio show kind of made some mistakes."

535
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,560
 This is one of those stories that is almost too good to be true, but when you deal with

536
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,200
 paranormal stuff, you run into that all the time.

537
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,880
 We've had alien invaders making kids disappear and we've had all sorts of Mormon Bigfoot.

538
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,480
 We've had all sorts of bizarre stuff over the course of the show that we come across

539
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,760
 stuff that's just so wacky and fun to look at that you want it to be true more than anything.

540
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,160
 And this to me is one of those stories.

541
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,520
 So that's the story of Ellen Austin.

542
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,360
 You know, I read a lot of stuff about ghost ships and mostly it's just like, "Oh, there's

543
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,160
 a boat that's abandoned," or "There's a boat that appears.

544
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
 It's a literal ghost ship.

545
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,080
 It just kind of floats around and then disappears."

546
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,240
 But I don't think I've ever come across one that's eaten two crews.

547
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,880
 Well, three basically, because it ate the first crew as well, if the story is true.

548
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
 They find a boat, everyone's gone.

549
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,920
 You put another crew on it, they disappear.

550
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,880
 You put another crew on it and the boat disappears.

551
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,280
 It's funny because we always think of ghost ships as like a derelict, a mystery, like

552
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,880
 why did these people leave the boat or like I said, a literal ghost ship.

553
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,080
 But what if in this case, it's a cryptid?

554
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,560
 It's a life form that's a perfect mimic.

555
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,440
 It adapted to a way to get people onto it.

556
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,120
 Now you're saying Jason, that's kind of ridiculous.

557
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,040
 Evolutionary, why would it evolve to eat people and then mimic to become a wooden boat so

558
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,920
 people would get on it.

559
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 There's much other stuff.

560
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,720
 Does the cryptid not like logbooks?

561
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,520
 Is it like vulnerable to paper and leather so it has to just throw those out?

562
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,000
 But I mean, I think we always try to say like, this is a ghost ship, this is a big foot,

563
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,680
 this is that, but why can't there be some intersection between those things?

564
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
 Are there ghost cryptids?

565
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,800
 Are there ghosts of Mothman?

566
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,320
 Are there aliens who are also cult leaders?

567
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,840
 And are there ghost ships that are actually living creatures that feed off of us?

568
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,880
 If that is true, it would have to change its hunting techniques as our boats changed.

569
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,240
 So if you're ever offered a free ride on a Carnival Cruise Line, you might want to think

570
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
 about it.

571
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,360
 Because you don't know if you're actually getting on the funnest boat experience of

572
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,400
 your life, this episode sponsored by Carnival Cruise Lines, or you're walking into the

573
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:35,560
 belly of a beast that will disappear and you will become nothing but a footnote in stories

574
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,760
 of those lost at sea.
