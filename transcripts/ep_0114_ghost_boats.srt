1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 are black helicopters, the scourge of conspiracy theorists and ranchers everywhere,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 really organic living creatures.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Then we take a look at a laughing epidemic that struck several girl schools in Africa,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 and then it spread into the nearby communities.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And then finally we take a look at the history of ghost steamboats.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Some say they still sail down the river.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I don't know, swim, whatever a boat does, move down the river.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Some say even today you can see their ghostly boat figures, whatever.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 You get it, you get it. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [Music]

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 You know you're in for one of those episodes and I can't even get through the intro correctly.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 A lot of times I go back and have to rerecord them a couple times.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We're just gonna let that one stand for now.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We're just gonna let that one stand because we got a lot of good stuff today.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Now, first thing we're gonna talk about is actually a recommendation from Shakira Shakira.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Now Shakira Shakira has given us some great stuff in the past.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I mentioned this briefly the other day.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I was dead asleep and I didn't... usually I have my notification shut off on my phone

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 because I get email at all matters of the day and the night and things like that.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And I got a notification. My phone's all ding and I was like, "Ugh, woke up."

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And Shakira Shakira had sent me a link about organic black helicopters.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Now I was actually really excited because organic black helicopters is on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It's something that I wanted to talk about but I could never find any information on it.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So I was like, "Okay, cool." He or she, I don't know, might actually be the real Shakira, possibly.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But I was like, "Okay, awesome. This person gave me this resource.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It gave me the link to the official page of the organic black helicopters."

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Brief, brief overview.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Black helicopters are basically a theory, a thing that's been around since about the 60s and 70s

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 where these relatively silent, completely black helicopters, so they're painted black

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 and they have no registry numbers on them.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Most helicopters have like aircraft to have like a registry number.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 These helicopters have no markings so you don't know if they're federal, you don't know if they're state,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 you don't know if it's some sort of private company or anything like that.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 They're relatively silent and a lot of times they're in connection with the men in black.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 A lot of times they're in connection with cattle mutilations.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 The militia groups, which is a, it still kind of is a big thing in America,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 but it was more big during the 80s and 90s.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 They always thought that the black helicopters were government controlled.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Here's the thing, black helicopters was one of those things that conspiracy theorists talked about a lot

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 and I always thought, well, duh, of course the government has unmarked helicopters.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Of course the government has silent helicopters.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It always seemed to be a no-brainer.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 To me, you could always, I could just, I don't think they had anything to do with the men in black or cattle mutilations,

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 but I'm sure that black helicopters, unmarked helicopters actually existed.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I never understood why that was ever an issue.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We did have it, we do have stealth helicopters.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 One of them crashed during the Osama bin Laden raid.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 They actually have technology so they're not as loud and they have a very low radar signature.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So black helicopters, the theory that they're out there and either the government's using them to spy on its own citizens

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 or it's some extra governmental agency or they're connected to some interdimensional or extraterrestrial group.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 That's been around for a long time, but on the conspiracy iceberg,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 there was the listing "Organic Black Helicopter".

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So, like I said, I was excited when I saw this website and the next day when I woke up,

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I took a look at it and it has, it's totally fake.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It's a joke. The whole theory is absolutely a joke.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And it's funny because it's hard to tell sometimes.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I had a friend, Mitchum, who sent me a thing called "Birds Aren't Real".

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I think I talked about that quite a while ago.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And when you first look at it, you're like, are there actually people who believe that birds aren't real?

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But once you kind of start digging into it and you see a lot of the photos, you're like, okay, this is a joke.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Like, this is making fun of conspiracy theorists.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Organic black helicopters are the same thing.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And after probably spending about 20 minutes reading the website, I saw stuff like,

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 "How to fight a baby black helicopter?"

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And they're like, "Here's step one, get a flyswatter."

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And I was like, "What?"

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And then the logo for the anti-organic black helicopters is a flyswatter.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 There is a video of an autopsy or a photo of an autopsy on a baby black helicopter.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It is simply someone taking a model helicopter apart piece by piece.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So it's very tongue-in-cheek.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But again, I'm thinking maybe this guy's just delusional.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I went to the frequently asked questions and it's very tongue-in-cheek there.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So it was just a joke.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 There could be someone else who believes that theory out there and has a different take on it.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Oh, and the idea was that black helicopters can have sex with each other

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 and make other black helicopters appear.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Or black helicopters can have sex with you.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And you either turn into a black helicopter or a bunch of baby black helicopters come out of your skin.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 But again, it's hard to tell sometimes.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 This site was obviously tongue-in-cheek once you kind of know what to look for.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Like I said, I went to the frequently asked questions and it was like,

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 "Oh, no one lies on the internet, right?"

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And I was like, "Okay, this guy knows what's up."

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 But there are other people out there who have crazier beliefs

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and you just, again, you have to kind of go, "Well, maybe they believe this, maybe they don't."

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 So you're thinking, "Jason, okay, that's really going to be one of your topics for the show."

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Well, I was like, "Okay, I can talk about that a little bit. There's not much I can do."

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But still, you know, I got to fill out the show, right?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You can't leave you guys wanting.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I was thinking about this today.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Black helicopters aside.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I was thinking about this today.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Why don't we have good mascots anymore?

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And not like baseball mascots and stuff like that.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 But when I was a kid, we had Spud's McKinsey and we had like Chester, Cheeto, Dude, the Cat.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And we had the, um, the, oh, the Yo-Karro Taco Bell dog

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and the little rat people for Quiznos and Jared Fogle for someone.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But we had like mascots. Actually, that's probably the reason why we don't have mascots anymore.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It's because Jared Fogle, but we used to have a lot and I don't think we have them anymore.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And I was thinking about that as like, those were always good ways to connect with the brand.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Like, you should have mascots.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 To be fair, we don't necessarily have a mascot here at Dead Rabbit Radio, but...

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And then I started thinking, there is a subculture of mascots that I want to have sex with.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 There is a subculture of like sexy mascots.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Sexy mascots.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So you're like, Jason, are you really talking about this? Yeah, yeah, you know, here.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 There are, I have a list of mascots that I want to have sex with.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Flo, the progressive girl, she's pretty hot. She looks like she'd be kind of crazy.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 The E-surance girl, remember the little cartoon chick? She really, she had a really nice body.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Plus she was athletic, that's always cool.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 There was this girl who was in Honda ads. She was like the, not the car salesman,

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 but she was like the girl behind the counter. She was really hot.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 See, it's kind of like that down to earth hot. It's kind of like that down to earth hot.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I was watching a movie last night called Sex Files, She Alien.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And I thought it was just going to be like a, what's it called?

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 A type of movie like Species, but it was actually like a soft-core porn.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And it was bizarre because the actress didn't talk the whole movie.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Someone else did the voiceover and it was actually a totally different actress.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You could tell because sometimes they would show the person talking.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It was someone totally different. It was super bizarre.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 But she was like super, super hot. And like sometimes you want like down to earth hot.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Down to earth hot.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 The Sunmaid Raisins girl on a little box, she's hot.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I know a lot of people like the Wendy's girl, but she looks too young.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I know they've tried to age her up recently. So she looks like she's in her 20s.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But it's still, she still looks young.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Side note, Grimace, if you type in Grimace porn, you will get no joke.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Multiple images by multiple artists of Grimace eating the Wendy's girl.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 What? So bizarre.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The Green M&M. The Green M&M, she has been like, she's sexy.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Like she's a bit round, you know, she's a bit Ruben-esque.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 She's not, you know, but there's just something attractive about her.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 She has no like female characteristics other than like I think lips and big eyelashes and a feminine voice.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But she's still quite attractive.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Any commercial that involves a librarian taking off her glasses and throwing your hair back.

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Those pop up every once in a while. Rare. Mostly in 1980s music videos, but you'll see them every once in a while.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 So there we go. That's organic black helicopters slash mascots that I want to have sex with.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I didn't have enough. I didn't have enough for the black helicopters thing, but I didn't want to just end it.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Okay, the next story we're going to talk about is you're like Jason.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We'd prefer if you just didn't put filler in the episode.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 We'd just prefer if you said there's nothing here and moved on.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 The next story we're going to talk about, or maybe you don't prefer, maybe you do want to know that probably not.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Okay, so then it's Friday, so this is my crazy day.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The next story we're going to talk about is weird because it's one of those stories that either reason behind it is bizarre,

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 but one is far creepier than the other.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So we're going back to Africa. We've been in England a lot now.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 We spent a lot of time in England, a lot of time in Africa.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Most of the time in the United States. We're going back to Africa though.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Now, this was in the region of Tongaika.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And what happened? It was just kind of a creepy visual the way everything sets out.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's January 30th. It's 1962. So we're back in time.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And all the, it's like this girl's school and everyone's just, you know, taking notes, listening to the teacher, messing around, shooting spitballs, whatever.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And there's these three girls in school in the class who just start laughing.

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 [Laughter]

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And the teacher's like, "Okay girls, you know, stop laughing. You're in class."

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And they keep laughing and it's getting disruptive. They're not stopping.

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 The teacher gets frustrated. She goes, "You know what? You guys go out to the schoolyard. Go out to this courtyard. You guys are disrupting the class."

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So the three girls march outside and they're in the courtyard.

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And the teacher continues her lesson and then one of the students goes, "Teacher, they're still laughing."

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And the teacher looks out the window and she sees these three girls just standing there.

164
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 [Laughter]

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 At nothing. And then other kids in the classroom start to get like wide smiles on their face.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 [Laughter]

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 The kids were described as having no joy on their face.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Their eyes actually looked like they were on the verge of tears.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 But they had these big smiles and they were laughing uncontrollably.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So you had 160 kids at the school total.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Out of those 160, this laughing virus hit 95 of them.

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And some of the girls would start crying, crying out loud as they were laughing.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And the adults now are getting really concerned about what's going on.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 You have almost 100 kids just laughing and they'd ask, "What are you laughing about?"

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 They're like, "I don't know. I don't know."

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Some of them use the term, "Things are moving in my mind."

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Now, teachers were getting frustrated by this, but at the same time they're getting concerned,

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 they begin to try to physically move the kids to airy because they don't know what's going on.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So they're like, "Get up. Get up." And the girl would just be laughing, laughing.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 They'd pick them up. The girls would start fighting back very violently.

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And the teacher would have to back off.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 These symptoms of this laughter, they had to dismiss the class.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 They're like, "Everyone go home. Everyone go home."

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But even when they went home, these kids would be laughing for a couple hours, just laughing to themselves.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Some of them laughed for up to 16 days.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Now, this is so recent that a lot of researchers went out there.

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So it's not something that has a lot of hyperbole behind it.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's not something that it's like a laughing fit that happened 400 years ago where you could be like,

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 "Well, maybe it wasn't that long. Maybe it was just hyperbole."

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 But there were researchers going out there to try to figure out what this was,

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 because what happened was, this continued for a while, obviously, the school actually shut down.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They're like, "We don't know what's going on. The kids are super disruptive.

193
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 We're totally afraid that this might be some sort of viral thing."

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 School shuts down. And when the school shuts down, a lot of the kids who were from neighboring areas went,

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 you know, some of the kids, like I said, went home who were around there,

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 but other kids went far away back to their homes, and the laughing virus spread in those towns as well.

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 They had another nearby middle school. 48 girls start laughing.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In all, in total, this thing went on for about six months to two years, depending on what area you were in.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Overall, 1,000 people infected with this virus. 14 schools just had to close until they could figure it out.

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 There was other physical symptoms, pain, fainting, flat flatuance,

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 which would just make you laugh more as, like, everyone in your family is laughing and your dad's passing gas.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Now, there's two theories here again.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 The first one is what you would assume, which would be mass hysteria.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And they were saying that these kids were coming like a war had just ended in their area, a conflict had just ended in their area,

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 and now they're in school, so they're like, they're dealing with the stress of school,

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and they're dealing with basically the PTSD of this conflict, and they're breaking down.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It was just this case of mass hysteria, which again is creepy because it shows how simple the human mind is,

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 how easily it can break.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But there's another actually creepier scenario.

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 There's one researcher, Sylvia Cardosa.

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It was a literal viral infection.

212
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It was something in their brain, some sort of parasite, some sort of virus, some sort of bug in their brain that got into their brain,

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and her theory was that brain damage can actually result in uncontrollable laughter.

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So her theory was these kids may have actually been passing on a viral infection to other people near them

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 that was causing temporary brain damage, which was causing them to laugh.

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And that's creepy.

217
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Other people have said, "No, we did brain tests, and that's probably not what it was."

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But if it was a virus that had not been detectable, a virus that we haven't encountered in such a large group,

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 they may not know what to look for.

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So again, it goes with the dancing madness thing.

221
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Like, both of those scenarios are creepy.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I think the fact that there could be some sort of viral infection that could cause temporary brain damage,

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 that would make you uncontrollably laugh, is even creepier.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 One is just our brains are very fragile, and anyone can fall into mass delusion.

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 The other one is that despite how powerful we think we are, there is some sort of parasite that can actually override parts of your brain

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and turn you into the Joker, basically.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I mean, turn you into someone who just laughs uncontrollably for days on end.

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Quite terrifying.

229
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And it's never been replicated.

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 In the area, they never had any problems with it afterwards.

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It was just kind of a one-time thing, but it did last quite a while.

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And it's always that thing like, if it popped back up, what would we do?

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 If all of a sudden, like, a town, the town of Hood River, everyone just starts, you know,

234
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 out of the 10,000 people who live here, 2,000 of them just start laughing uncontrollably.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It'd be terrifying.

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Think about that.

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Think about, you know, you're trying to get a date, you're going out to the club, and everyone's just laughing.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I mean, you walk in a club, everyone's laughing at you?

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 That'd be terrible.

240
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I'm going to now chalk up that when anyone ever laughs at me, I'm like,

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "You gotta bring a pair of sight, don't you?"

242
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And that will be my defense against that horrible, horrible laughter when I walk into a room.

243
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Okay, so our last story is going to be ghost boats of the river, and specifically steam boats.

244
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Now, I'd love to say ghost boats of the Mississippi because that has kind of a cool tone to it,

245
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 but they weren't on the Mississippi, so I can't say that.

246
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I mean, you know how big I am on hitting my facts right.

247
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 These are actually both of these boat stories are in Alabama, and both of these ghost stories I got from the National Directory of Haunted Places.

248
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I always like plugging that book. I think it's a great book.

249
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I don't own it. I didn't write it, anything like that.

250
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 If you use the affiliate link below, I'll get a little kickback, but, you know, I get no--

251
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I'm not sponsored by them at all.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So we're going to look at some ghost boats.

253
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 We're going to look at boats that are ghosts or boats that had ghosts on them.

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Or, yeah, that's pretty much it.

255
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So we're going to Alabama, Alabama.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And down in Alabama, there's a place called the Tom Bigby River.

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Tom-- Tom Bigby. I wonder if that was a guy named Tom.

258
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I wonder if that's Native American, or if there was actually a guy there named Tom Bigby.

259
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I don't know. Maybe his name was Tom B., and he was big.

260
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But anyways, there's a river called the Tom Bigby River.

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Now, we're going back in the-- Now, this story is really interesting to me, because I think there's a lot of facts to it,

262
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and then there's a lot of legend to it, and it's-- You kind of got to figure out which is what.

263
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So in 1908, there was this guy named Norman Stales, and he had a dream.

264
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 He wanted to build the most beautiful steamboat since the Civil War.

265
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And in 1908, that was only like, what, 60 years ago, 40 years ago, something like that.

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So he was like, "I'm going to build the steamboats like they used to have."

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So he got a bunch of investors together. He got this boat, this beautiful, beautiful boat named.

268
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And he named it-- I thought this was sweet-- he named it after his father.

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So it was called James T. Staples, or James Staples boat.

270
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 James T. Staples palatial steamboat. I don't know. It was something hoity-toity, but it was definitely named after his dad, James Staples.

271
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And he was so proud of it, and he's like, "I've built it. I've built this great boat. Like, this is ready to go."

272
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But what happened was in 1912, he started to fall into financial distress.

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 They were starting to have money problems, so his creditors took the boat.

274
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 So it had been an operation, but the creditors took the boat, and he couldn't bear to have his life work, this beautiful piece of machinery,

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 that he sweated over for years with his dad's name on it taken from him.

276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And in January 1913, so basically a year after he lost the boat, he put a shotgun to his chest, killed himself.

277
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Almost immediately, there were sightings of his ghost on the James T. Staples boat.

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 The crew saw him in the boiler room. Like, enough people saw him. They saw him walking around the boiler room.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The crew quit. The crew were like, "No way. There's a ghost on this ship. This is a real bad omen. We quit."

280
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Another interesting thing that happened was all the rats jumped off the boat.

281
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Now, normally that would be a good thing. Normally, they would be like, "You know what? That's weird. All the rats jumped off this boat.

282
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You should be like... First off, you should be like, "I didn't know there were that many rats on this boat. Look at them!"

283
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They're making like... They actually like, are so many rats, it looks like a small island floating down the river.

284
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 How did we have that many rats on this boat? But again, that was a bad omen that all the rats jumped off.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Again, like, if I walked in on McDonald's and I saw all the rats leaving, I wouldn't think that was a bad omen.

286
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I wouldn't go back to the McDonald's, but I wouldn't go like, "Oh, that McDonald's is going to blow up."

287
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Spoiler alert. And then to top it all off, James T. Staples was supposed to make a run, and the run was going to take it past Norman Staples' funeral.

288
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And the captain was like, "You know what? That's completely disrespectful. I'm not going to sail his boat. Can't we take another route to get to where we're going?

289
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I don't want to sail past his funeral." It was a paddle boat. It was a steamboat. It didn't sail, but I don't know the right word.

290
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I don't want to paddle this boat down the river, and so he got fired.

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And so the company hired a new crew and a new captain who didn't know about the ghosts, didn't know about the rats.

292
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 People are coming on the boat. They're like, "Man, this is a clean ship. I haven't seen one rat on it all day long."

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You get on the boat, the boat's sailing, paddling down the river. It gets to where Norman Staples' grave is. The boiler blows up.

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 [BOOM]

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 "Whoa! I'm on fire! If only there were some rats here that I could milk and put the fire out!"

296
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 26 people dead, including the captain. I think the captain was down there. It doesn't matter.

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's all just blown up by the force or by the scolding hot water and all sorts of stuff. And the boat sank.

298
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And so that's the legend of the James T. Staples boat.

299
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 What's interesting, so we know what's 100% true. Norman Staples built the boat. He killed himself. It wasn't named after his father.

300
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 The crew quit. The captain quit. They got a new crew, a new captain, and the boiler blew up.

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 What we don't know for sure. What's interesting about it, you can say whether or not they saw the ghost.

302
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But the part of the story that gets suspect-- and it did blow up, but the part of the story suspect is some reports say it blew up six miles from the graveyard where Norman Staples was.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Some reports say it blew up as it was passing Norman Staples' grave. Which is a big difference. I mean, six miles is just a faulty boiler.

304
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 At the site of his grave, you could be like, "Woohoo, that is spooky."

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But the fact that we have a six mile difference there makes me a little more suspicious of some of the other details in the story.

306
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But even at the time, there was a newspaper, the Columbus Commercial, and they in their article were like, "Man, that was really weird."

307
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 But it's interesting to think how much the story's changed. I'm sure the original report was it blew up six miles from his grave.

308
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And then over time, it's become like right as it passed his grave, which is what I read initially that it blew up.

309
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 But I thought it was an interesting story nonetheless. Now, you're thinking, "Jason, you promised me ghost boats. You promised me boats that were ghosts."

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And you just told me a story about a ghost blowing up a boat, which I think is pretty-- oh, and 21 people got injured, too.

311
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 So that's a pretty good attack for a ghost for an incorporeal spirit. Or is it non-corporeal?

312
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 But anyways, that's a pretty good body count. But anyway, so let's talk about a ghost boat.

313
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Now, we're still in Alabama. This story is equally terrifying. It's a Titanic on land, if you will.

314
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 The Eliza battle. So now we're back in 1858. So this is way back in time from the James T. Staples Riverboat.

315
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Riverboat! That's what they're called. Anyway, so Eliza battle was a-- I'll just call it a steamboat.

316
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 What's the difference? The one with the paddle, right? I think is that a riverboat and a steamboat?

317
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 'Cause like, "Too-too!" Like, has like the smoke coming out? I should research this before I do the show, but--

318
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Ghost steamboat. Eliza battle. 1858. It had a crew of 45. You had 60 passengers.

319
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 They're going for a nice leisurely trip down the river. It starts raining.

320
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And well, actually, it's already raining. And they're like, "Oh, you know, coming down the river, playing ragtime music or whatever."

321
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And, "Doo-doo-doo." Yeah, I can't do ragtime music. But anyway, so the boat's coming down the river.

322
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And it's raining already. So everyone's kind of inside. And then it keeps raining and raining and raining.

323
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And then it starts to flood. And they're like, "Uh-oh, this isn't good."

324
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 The temperature drops. And everything turns to sleet and ice. And the people on the boat are like, "We just need to keep going."

325
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 'Cause this is getting really, really bad, really, really fast. You have to be inside now. It's freezing cold outside.

326
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 The whole front bow, the whole sides of the ships, everything, are covered in icicles.

327
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 The temperature drops so quickly that everything's ice outside.

328
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What happens, though, is that the stern catches on fire. I think that's the back of the boat, right?

329
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But anyways, one of the sides of the boat, it's the bow, port, starboard. Yeah, the stern is the back.

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 So anyways, that part catches on fire. And they were saying that the people on the boat, I'm trying not to laugh,

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 but this would be a sucky thing. The people on the boat had a choice. They got either burned to death or freeze to death.

332
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Like, you could either stay back where the fire was and be warm, but eventually burn.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Or you could go to the front of the boat and just freeze to death, because you weren't prepared for the weather.

334
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 It's super, super cold out there. And you couldn't jump into the river 'cause you'd freeze.

335
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It was just a bad scenario altogether.

336
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 What's interesting is that the boat, because it's a flood, so the river's over the banks, and the boat starts to go out of the river

337
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and begins crashing through the forest. And at this point, a lot of people are like,

338
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "As bad as this seems that this boat is just, you know, smashing into trees and getting these huge gaping holes in it."

339
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 This is our chance. Because before we could either freeze to death on the boat, burn to death on the back of the boat,

340
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 jump into the river or freeze, and people start saying, "Dude, just jump onto a tree."

341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So as the boat was crashing--this is all real. This is all historical.

342
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 As the boat was crashing through the trees, people began jumping off the side of the boats and hanging in trees.

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Overall, 29 people died. And remember, it had about 105 people on the boat, so 29 people died.

344
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Some of them burned to death. A lot of them froze to death.

345
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And when the rescue crew showed up, they were basically pulling people out of trees.

346
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Some people grabbed onto the trees, they still froze, but for the most part, when they showed up, they were able to--

347
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 they were like, "What the hell? They see boat wreckage, a fire, a bunch of ice, and then a bunch of dudes up in the trees."

348
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And it's not like they were like, "Hey, what are you doing up there?"

349
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 You're just like rescuing people, but they weren't questioning them. But you have to wonder, like, the rescue people were probably like,

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 "What the hell happened here? Why is a boat in the forest and the people on the boat in the trees?"

351
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But anyways, so--and how did they have ladders back then? I wonder when--here's an interesting question.

352
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 When did we invent the ladder? Like, at what point in human history--I'm sure it was like Egyptian, like, way, way back in the day.

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Wait, Jacob's ladder was in the Bible, so they were like, old things. But I wonder who the first person who said, "That's high."

354
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I'm gonna build the ladder. And don't laugh, because that's actually, like, hard, because you don't just build--

355
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 well, I wonder what came first, actually, stairs or ladder? Like, which one? Well, I guess there's not Jacob's stairs in the Bible.

356
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Well, I know they had stairs in the Bible. Anyways, anyways, I'll have to figure that out what came first, staples.

357
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I'll have to figure that out what came first, stairs or ladders. I'm gonna bet--I'm gonna bet it was--I'm gonna bet it was stairs,

358
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 because you can carve those out of dirt. You can, like, make stairs in a cave. A ladder, you need, like, trees.

359
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You need to cut a tree, and then another tree, and then, like, little trees in the middle to climb.

360
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Stairs, you just go, "Oh, I'm just gonna move some dirt, and then I'm gonna step up and move some of the dirt."

361
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Anyways, so the rescue crew, yes, they had ladders and possibly stairs with them. They get everyone out of the tree.

362
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 To this day, people still say that on a foggy night, you can see the Eliza battle going down the river.

363
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 A river in Alabama, which I don't remember what the name of it is, but you'll know it because you see a ghost ship.

364
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 That's creepy enough. The ghost ship going down the river is creepy, but fishermen, other boats in the area have reported,

365
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 not only do they see the ghostly image of the Eliza battle, but they hear the cries and pleas for help of the 29 people who died that night

366
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 still stuck on that ghostly steamboat. That always creeps me out. Like, they're stuck in that torment for eternity.

367
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 So I don't like rivers anyway, so I don't go down them in any type of boat, especially a ghost boat.

368
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 When it do it, I probably just fall through the bottom.

369
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 But luckily, I'd fall onto a bunch of escaping rats from some other doomship, and I would just go off to the shore.
