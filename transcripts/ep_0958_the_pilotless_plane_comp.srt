1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Why are ghost stories so depressing?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,560
 Like I mean, other than the whole dying part, why are they so grim?

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,600
 And then we take a look at the story of a plane that crashed along the shores of the

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,080
 Great Lakes.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 When Rescue Crew showed up ready to save the lives of anyone on board, they have no idea

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,920
 they're about to find themselves in Proyol.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,080
 In a bizarre mystery.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:41,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
 I'm your host, Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,580
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,080
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out in the world and doing whatever you're doing.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,080
 Everyone get on your feet and give a big round of applause for the Internet Ghost.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
 Woohoo!

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
 Yeah, come on in.

18
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
 He's floating on in.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
 No legs.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
 Looking like Casper.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
 Come on in.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
 Come on in, the Internet Ghost.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,080
 You know, I keep making that joke about Casper not having any legs, and then I always remember

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
 he does have legs.

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 He has little tiny boy legs.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 Well, the Internet Ghost legs are not.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 And the reason why is he bought me a book for my birthday off my Amazon wish list.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
 It's in the show notes.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 He bought me the book, the mammoth book of cover-ups.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
 I like these books that are just kind of like short entries on stuff.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
 If you want to do your own research, you can.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
 And it's cool.

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 I was flipping through this book.

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 There's a lot of boomer conspiracy theories in here, right?

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,080
 There's a lot of ones that I remember growing up with, like obviously we have Area 51.

37
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 Harp.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
 That's not even around anymore.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
 Harp's been torn down.

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 Well, that's what they want.

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 That's what they want us to believe.

42
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 And then there's stuff.

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
 Again, that's great.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,080
 And the other stuff that I don't know about, one of them here I think we'll do on an upcoming episode,

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,080
 is the Port Chicago explosion.

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
 It's funny.

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 I almost covered it just because I thought it was kind of hilarious.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
 I mean, a bunch of people died.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 It's not that funny, but the way they died, apparently someone, it was this port.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
 It was this port area where they were unloading all these munitions.

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 And at one point, a supervisor showed up and goes,

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 "You guys do realize that those are a bunch of bombs.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
 Quit banging them together.

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
 People are like tipping over carts of bombs."

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 It's kind of like a Laurel and Hardy movie.

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 If 500 people blew up at the ending, well, it turns out there's a conspiracy theory about that.

57
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
 I never heard it.

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 I almost covered it as a true crime, just a weird incident type of story.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,080
 But looking in the Mammoth Book of Cover-Ups, it turns out the conspiracy theory may be much more sinister than that.

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
 So I can't wait.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 We'll probably cover that on an upcoming episode.

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
 Very, very intriguing.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 Thank you very much, The Internet Ghost.

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys can't send me birthday books, that's totally fine.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
 It really is.

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
 Just help spread the word about the show.

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,080
 The Internet Ghost, I hope your hands are caporial,

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 because I'm going to toss you the keys to the dead rabbit, Durgable.

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
 Fly us all the way out to Ontario, California.

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,080
 [Burps]

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,080
 In Ontario, California, there's a place known as Bonview Park.

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 And that's where we're going to be.

75
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 We're walking around, sitting on a park bench, feeding pigeons, popcorn and stuff like that.

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,080
 And we're force feeding them.

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
 They're like, "Oh, please, no more. No more."

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 We're like, "No, eat the popcorn. Eat the popcorn."

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
 We have all these fat pigeons walking around.

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
 We're sitting on the park bench.

81
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
 The reason why is because we got to be here for a while.

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 We showed up at two in the afternoon.

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 This story doesn't start until 10 p.m.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 So finally, the sun has set.

85
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 The pigeons have waddled away.

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 We're all just sitting on this park bench.

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
 And we're looking out into Bonview Park.

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 And you'll notice, look over by that tree there.

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 See that tree? See that tree right there?

90
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,080
 You're sitting there and you're looking and you go,

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
 "What? What is that?"

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,080
 And you hear a, "Hehehehehehe."

93
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 It's not Michael Jackson.

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
 You go, "What? What?"

95
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
 You're super scared to try to leave,

96
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
 but I fed you so much popcorn, I'm like, "Aha ha ha."

97
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
 Me and Michael Jackson have plans for you.

98
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 I love Michael Jackson. I don't even know why I make those jokes.

99
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
 I love Michael Jackson.

100
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
 Anyways, we're sitting on this bench and I go,

101
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 "See that? Hehehehehe."

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 And you notice, you see a little girl in the middle of the park.

103
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
 She's kind of poking her head out from behind the tree.

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
 And she's looking at you, giggling.

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 And you go, "What? The little girl shouldn't be here all alone."

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 And you look at that girl, she doesn't look over the age of 10.

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 And I go, "She's not over the age of 8 to be specific."

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,080
 Hehehehehe. Woohoohoohoo.

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 And you notice now she's behind a different tree.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 The story goes as thus.

111
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 If you go to Bonvue Park after 10 p.m.,

112
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 you'll see a little girl, she's between the ages of 7 and 8,

113
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 hiding behind the trees in the park.

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
 And as you get close to one tree and you look,

115
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 she's not there, now she's behind another tree.

116
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
 She's giggling. Hehehehehe. Woohoohoo. Hehehehehe.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 Look at me, I'm a little girl.

118
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
 And then you go to that tree and she's gone.

119
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 And she'll be behind another tree, staring at you from the darkness.

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,080
 You figure if you're going to be a ghost,

121
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 you might as well be a ghost outside,

122
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 would it be good, preferable, right?

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
 Because then you can watch stuff.

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 If you're a ghost, we've covered ghosts.

125
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
 We had a ghost in a Burger King bathroom.

126
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 We had a ghost in a Payless shoe store.

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 It's like, there's bad places to be ghosts.

128
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
 I think being outside would be pretty dope.

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
 And we've covered hanging ghosts and hitchhiking ghosts.

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 I mean, they're still outside, but that's pretty miserable.

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
 At least she can run around the park and have fun.

132
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 So let's put all that stuff in the good ghost category.

133
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 But this story, I was reading through the Shadowlands,

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
 which is a big ghost story website, ghost repository of

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
 supposedly true ghostly events.

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 We covered them a lot on this podcast.

137
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
 I was going through all of their stuff,

138
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 and this story kind of stuck out to me,

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
 because one, you got a friendly ghost who's outside.

140
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 She wants to play hide and go seek with you, according to reports.

141
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,080
 But then of course we got to get to the why is there a ghost here?

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 Who's this ghost girl and stuff like that.

143
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 And when we get to that, it really gets just kind of,

144
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 it ups it to 11 as far as the terrifying thing.

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,080
 As you've been running around these trees trying to catch this girl,

146
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 you're like, I'm going to find you!

147
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 I'm going to find you!

148
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 And I hear you kind of running through the darkness.

149
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 This is so terrifying to me.

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 It turns out that, if this ghost story is true,

151
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 and we'll get into that as well,

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
 but this little girl, she's seven or eight years old,

153
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 the story is that in the park, she was raped and murdered.

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 So now her ghost is trapped in this park running from tree to tree,

155
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
 playing hide and go seek.

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
 And that opens a whole box of craziness.

157
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 And really, I wanted to talk about this story,

158
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 because I wanted to talk about this issue in total.

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
 I read tons of these ghost stories.

160
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 I read them in bulk, pretty much at this point, right?

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 And so many of them involve rape and murder as a combination.

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
 Which on a paranormal level, it makes sense, right?

163
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,080
 Because when we think about someone leaving a ghost behind,

164
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 the qualifications in general are unfinished business,

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
 a particular location that's known to trap the souls,

166
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
 or at least trap the recordings of certain events.

167
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,080
 And the third one is a brutal death.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
 The third one is a brutal death.

169
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 Those are the things that we usually see when we see haunted areas.

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
 So obviously a rape and a murder would qualify as that third one.

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 It's just a brutal way to go out.

172
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 So we have that.

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 We have the fact that it possibly would result in a haunting, right?

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 Like a brutal murder against a young girl.

175
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,080
 Rape and murder against a young girl, right?

176
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
 On the other hand, because I wasn't able to find any proof

177
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
 that this particular crime happened in this area,

178
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 I'm sure that it has.

179
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
 It's just the horrendous nature of humanity

180
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
 that something like this could happen.

181
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
 So I have no proof that a girl, that actually happened to a girl here.

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 There's no news reports of it, but it's just such a weird phenomenon.

183
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,080
 And on the one hand, you could say a lot of these stories are made up.

184
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
 A lot of these ghost stories are made up.

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
 They're passed down generation to generation.

186
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
 They're urban legends.

187
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 And of course, urban legends are always going to be super creepy.

188
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
 They're going to be the most exaggerated.

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
 It's just depressing.

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 It makes a lot of these stories even more depressing.

191
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 I mean, you're already talking about a ghost girl, a little ghost girl.

192
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 So that means the girl's dead,

193
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
 but then they throw in the rape and murder thing

194
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
 and either somebody made it up and they made it up to be extra creepy.

195
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
 Or it's real.

196
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
 Or it's real and this actually happened.

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
 And it's just such a...

198
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
 It's disturbing.

199
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
 You know what I mean? It's disturbing on a different level.

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
 And...

201
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 Is she playing hide and go seek?

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 Like that's when I was reading this,

203
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,080
 just like yesterday's episode, I was reading this in a bagel shop.

204
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 Was she playing hide and go seek?

205
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,080
 Like is the ghost of the girl playing hide and go seek?

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,080
 Or is she trying to hide from her attacker?

207
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 Because of me, they're in this story and never said she's giggling.

208
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,080
 I kind of added that because it's a non-audio podcast.

209
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 But it just says she's playing hide and go seek.

210
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 She's hiding behind trees.

211
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 So is it that she's playing hide and go seek?

212
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
 She wants someone to play with her?

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
 Or is this the last moments of her life as she was running through this park?

214
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,080
 She was hiding behind trees trying to outwit this creep?

215
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
 And that's the case.

216
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
 It just makes it even worse, right?

217
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
 Because maybe people are like,

218
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
 "Hey, let's go play hide and go seek with this little ghost girl."

219
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
 And they're making her relive those moments.

220
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
 Like they're actually looking for her behind trees and she's kind of...

221
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
 It's gross!

222
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 Like, "Oh, Jason, thanks for ruining my Tuesday."

223
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,080
 It's just such a creepy story.

224
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 It's such a creepy story.

225
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
 Paranormal cannot exist without true crime.

226
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
 That's really just the way that it works.

227
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
 Or at least like ghosts.

228
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 Obviously aliens don't need a murder to come to Earth.

229
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,080
 But ghosts almost always need some sort of horrific crime to take place.

230
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 Or maybe not necessarily a crime, but a horrific accident at the very least.

231
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 Or a war or something like that.

232
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
 There's always some sort of human tragedy.

233
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,080
 When you come across story after story after story after story like this,

234
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,080
 it does really kind of wear you down, right?

235
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,080
 I mean, I finished my bagel, but it's just creepy.

236
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
 It's just creepy.

237
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,080
 This was like probably the 30 or 40th one entry that I saw that included rape and murder.

238
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,080
 And not even really the only one that involved a kid.

239
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,080
 But the idea of her running through the darkness, quote unquote, playing hide and go seek,

240
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
 and we don't...

241
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 Is that what she was doing?

242
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
 Is she trying to have fun?

243
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,080
 Or is she reliving her last memory?

244
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
 It's just horrific, right?

245
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 It's a creepy story.

246
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 This is one of those stories that I hope is not true, right?

247
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,080
 This is like, I would not be disappointed if I went here to do a ghost investigation,

248
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
 and there was no ghost.

249
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 I would totally be fine with that.

250
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
 This would be a one where I'd be like, "Oh, that's it guys.

251
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
 No ghost.

252
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
 We were out here for the past two weeks.

253
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 All the pigeons in Ontario are dead, and there's no ghost here.

254
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
 I would have no problem finding out this story was fake.

255
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,080
 An urban legend doesn't exist totally.

256
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
 But there are a ton of them out there.

257
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 As a paranormal researcher, it would make sense that such a tragic death would result in that, right?

258
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 Horrible, horrible story though.

259
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
 I feel guilty for sharing it with you.

260
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,080
 We'll get ready for tomorrow's episode, because that's kind of worse.

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 Anyways, the internet ghost, you dodge your bullet because you're not on tomorrow's episode.

262
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
 I'm going to toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

263
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,080
 We are leaving behind a very unsuccessful ghost hunt.

264
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 There is no ghost at Bond View Park, thankfully.

265
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
 I'm tossing you keys of the carbonar copter.

266
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 Take us all the way out.

267
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 Oh, this is interesting.

268
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
 I didn't plan it this way.

269
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,080
 Take us all the way out to Ontario, Canada.

270
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,080
 [imitates car engine]

271
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 Specifically, we're headed to a town known as Marathon in Ontario.

272
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 It's March 15th, 2017.

273
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
 It's 11.30 p.m.

274

275

 [imitates car engine]

276
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 On the shores of Lake Superior, a plane has just crashed.

277
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 Out of the darkness and into the snowy landscape, a Cessna Skyhawk smashes into the ground.

278
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,080
 Rescue crews are immediately dispatched to go see what happened.

279
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 They're super curious. They got nothing else going on.

280
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,080
 They're driving out there. Hopefully they can rescue anyone who was on board.

281
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,080
 They get there and of course they see this Cessna plane crashed into the ground and they're running through the snow.

282
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
 They're firemen, maybe? I don't know.

283
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
 Maybe there's just a bunch of ambulance people? I don't know.

284
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 Who comes to plane crashes?

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,080
 I'm assuming you'd have a couple firemen and then some medics.

286
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 And then maybe a police officer, say, "Stay back, stay back!"

287
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 Everyone else, there's no one. It's a snowy night.

288
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 They're like, "It's too cold to go out and check out that airplane crash."

289
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,080
 The rescue crews get there and they're like, "Let's open that up and see if there's somebody in it."

290
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 Because obviously there is, right? Obviously there is. A plane has just crashed.

291
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 So they open the door up, or maybe they just look in the window, but either way, there's no one in the plane.

292
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:54,080
 Okay, he must have gotten out, right? Whoever was in this plane crash must have got out and started running.

293
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 Or most likely walking or limping.

294
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
 Through the wilderness, you get a massive concussion. Your plane's crashed.

295
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 So they begin, because that'll happen, right? People have been flung out of cars and they just walked into the middle of fields and stuff.

296
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 They start looking for this guy. The first thing they're thinking, "Let's follow the tracks, right? There's snow everywhere. We'll just follow his footprints."

297
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,080
 We'll find him.

298
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 So the rescue crew starts looking around this plane. There's no footprints leading away from it.

299
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 No tracks of any kind. It's not like a car got there before them, or he just happened to have an ATV,

300
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 stashed in the woods, and took off nothing.

301
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 This plane had no pilot.

302
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:51,080
 And what they realized is that the autopilot was on, and the plane was out of fuel.

303
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,080
 Firefighters and the medics went home. They're like, "Oh man, I thought it was going to save a life."

304
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,080
 They went home and the investigators showed up, and they're like, "Get out of the way, guys. It's our time to shine."

305
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 And they start to look into what the world happened.

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,080
 They were able to find out that this Cessna plane was rented from an airport in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

307
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 And the flight plan was set up, and it was going to take off from Ann Arbor, and it was going to land in Harbor Springs,

308
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,080
 which is about 348 miles south of where it actually landed.

309
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 It actually crashed, right?

310
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 They also were able to find out that the plane was rented by a man known as Zin Rong.

311
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 Zin Rong. He was a 27-year-old doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan.

312
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,080
 But where is he? What's the plane doing here? He rented it that day.

313
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 He got in the airplane at that airport, took off from Ann Arbor.

314
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,080
 The plane crashes maybe 350 miles off course.

315
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,080
 Like, completely overshooting its target, flies over the Great Lakes, crashes.

316
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 So where in the world does the pilot?

317
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,080
 Now, it's interesting the articles almost immediately start saying, "He must have jumped out."

318
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 I mean, that's obvious, but they're basically saying, "He must have committed suicide."

319
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 That was really what the investigators were talking about right off.

320
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 Like, this must have been a suicide.

321
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,080
 And to back that theory up, right? I've seen a lot of, like, faked deaths, a lot of missing peoples.

322
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 Generally, and I might just be a state-by-state thing, but generally it is 10 years before they can declare you legally dead.

323
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 Might be state-by-state, but generally speaking, it's 10 years.

324
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 And that's to, you know, make sure people aren't committing insurance fraud or having their debt wiped out and then being like, "Haha, I'm back!"

325
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:03,080
 For Zin Rong, he was legally declared dead in 2017.

326
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,080
 What do you mean? So that year, his plane takes off, it crashes.

327
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 He's not in it. There's no proof that he's dead. There's no proof of his body anywhere in the wreckage, anywhere around the wreckage.

328
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:26,080
 And still, they declare him legally dead.

329
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,080
 And he started to see articles popping out and they said, "Listen, could you, 'cause apparently the Cessna was flying fairly low, they go,

330
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 "Could you have parachuted out of this, like, if you were the only one flying it, could you have jumped out of the plane with the parachute successfully landed?"

331
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 And one of the articles was saying, "Yeah, that is possible. You can base jump from a fairly low altitude, let's say, 1,500 feet."

332
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
 You would have to kind of know what you were doing, but you could do it.

333
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,080
 There is a chance that he got up on this airplane and then just parachuted out.

334
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,080
 Then the other question goes back to why? Why would he do that? Why would he just jump out of his plane?

335
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,080
 And remember, it's a rented plane too, so it's not like even if he didn't want to base jump, he's gonna have to pay for the plane that crashed.

336
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 Then he also had the thought that, remember, this flight plan was only supposed to go from Ann Arbor to Harbor Springs.

337
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 And he's not on it, it shoots past Harbor Springs for about 350 miles.

338
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:30,080
 It's flying unmanned, totally off of its flight path, just on autopilot, just in a straight line until it ran out of fuel.

339
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,080
 So any other plane could have gotten hit, it could have been a huge catastrophe. Why would he have done this?

340
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 But they legally declare him dead in 2017.

341
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
 Which, although that's quite odd,

342
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,080
 in 2018, they find some bones.

343
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 They find some bones in a field, a guy was putting his fence up, he found some bones out there,

344
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,080
 in Chappend Township, Michigan.

345
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,080
 Less than 100 miles from the Ann Arbor airport.

346
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,080
 And I'm using street miles, I didn't have the nautical miles, I know there's a bunch of pilots pulling their hair out right now.

347
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,080
 But less than 100 miles from Ann Arbor's airport, they found his bones.

348
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 So he jumped out, almost immediately.

349
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,080
 Like if you took a car, it would be about a half hour drive from the airport to where his bones were found.

350
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 So in a plane, what is that, 20 minutes?

351
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 So he jumped out before it even hit Harbor Springs.

352
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:50,080
 It was flying for hundreds of miles over populated areas with no pilot.

353
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,080
 But when they found the bones in 2018, they didn't know who they belonged to.

354
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:04,080
 It actually wasn't until 2021 that due to DNA testing and dental records, they were finally able to confirm it was Zenrong.

355
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 But that's still weird, again I have to go back to that, they declared him legally dead in 2017.

356
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
 They didn't find his bones until 2018, but they didn't know they were his bones.

357
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 They didn't know it until four years after he was legally declared dead.

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
 He was identified.

359
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:30,080
 It's such an interesting story, we have this young man who jumped out of this plane.

360
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 And from the articles that I found, you didn't have a lot of pushback.

361
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,080
 You didn't have a lot of pushback from friends or family saying, "Oh, he would never do anything like that."

362
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 He loved flying planes the whole way.

363
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 We didn't see anything about the family coming out saying, "Our son would never kill himself."

364
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 We didn't see these articles.

365
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 I'm not saying they don't exist, I'm not saying that those statements weren't made,

366
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,080
 but I wasn't able to find that narrative in the articles I was reading.

367
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 It was just, he wasn't in the plane when it crashed, so he must have jumped out, case closed.

368
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 You go, "Jason, well, he did jump out. They found his bones. They found his bones in the middle of this field."

369
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 I find it, let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

370
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,080
 I find it so odd that someone would rent a plane to kill themselves.

371
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 I do find it particularly odd when people kill themselves outside of, you know, a thousand enemy troops moving in on your position

372
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 or, you know, you're dying of some horrific disease.

373
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,080
 I find suicide, you know, sad and incomprehensible sometimes, right?

374
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 But, I mean, if you wanted to j-- I wanted to analyze this guy's possible suicide, right?

375
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,080
 But you figure there's a lot of ways to go.

376
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,080
 You rent a plane. Like, it just seems so, um, dangerous to other people, right?

377
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,080
 This plane could have done a lot of damage. It seems weird, doesn't it?

378
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,080
 I just find it so weird how quickly this mystery was "solved."

379
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,080
 Even though it was eventually solved, eventually they did find his bones.

380
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 They wrapped it up so quickly. They just were like, "Oh, well, he must have jumped out of the plane, case closed."

381
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 So we're gonna declare him legally. They were not even gonna look for him. That's what we think happened.

382
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,080
 Now, listen, there could be a suicide note that was never released through the media. I just thought of that.

383
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 There could have been-- that could have been why the family wasn't making any statements about it. That's possible, too.

384
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 What if conspiracy cap fully on-- what would make you jump out of a plane?

385
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
 You were the only pilot of and you didn't have a fair shoot.

386
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,080
 Aliens. Why are you fucking chasing a plane? Are you really gonna try to convince me this guy committed suicide?

387
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,080
 Well, no, I'm not saying he committed suicide. He's flying his plane.

388
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,080
 Maybe he just got abducted. I don't know.

389
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Maybe he got abducted and they abducted him right out of the plane.

390
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 You're like shutting off the podcast. You're like, "Nope. I'm done. You're taking off your conspiracy cap."

391
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 You're like, "Oh, where did this end up?"

392
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 Planes flying. Guy gets abducted out of the plane.

393
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,080
 Plane continues to fly until it runs out of fuel.

394
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,080
 And then we've had this happen before, too. Aliens dropping people off in the wrong location.

395
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:26,080
 Like, Jason, he's a pile of bones. He's a pile of bones. Did they drop him off 1400 feet up in the air?

396
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 I don't know. You don't have all the answers.

397
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 But...

398
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,080
 I'm realizing how insensitive this is because it's possible. I didn't think.

399
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 I honestly did not think of the fact that he might have had a suicide note.

400
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 And that's why the family was never objecting to this.

401
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,080
 And that's why they-- I totally did not even think about that.

402
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 With this podcast, a lot of times I'm also thinking about what I'm saying as I'm saying it for the first time.

403
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 And I was like, "That would make sense of why they would illegally declare him dead."

404
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 I planned on doing this whole ending about aliens abducting him.

405
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,080
 Which is still possible.

406
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,080
 Wouldn't that be nuts if you're like, "You know what? I'm done. I'm ready to kill myself."

407
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 And you tried hanging yourself and then you were aboard an alien spacecraft.

408
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 Like, right before you died you get abducted. That'd be crazy.

409
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 I still can't work it into an ending of this show.

410
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 But yeah, I'm thinking now that he must have had a suicide note.

411
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
 That would explain why they would have declared him legally dead.

412
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 And you know, to be honest, there is. There was a story that just happened earlier this year.

413
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,080
 This was the counterbalance my alien scenario.

414
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 I was going to talk about aliens for a couple minutes and say how that could have happened.

415
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

416
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

417
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

418
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

419
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

420
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 And I was like, "I'm not going to declare him legally dead. I'm not going to declare him legally dead."

421
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 Aliens have dropped people off in the wrong location and it is possible they dropped him off 1400 feet in the air,

422
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
 or he died and they dropped his bones off.

423
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,080
 I mean, again, the theory didn't work 100%.

424
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
 That was the whole thing. The government declared him legally dead, but they knew he got abducted that night.

425
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 And then as a counterbalance to that, I wasn't going to talk about this.

426
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,080
 So I know this episode of the Internet Ghost is starting to figure out how to get his book back.

427
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
 Let me end with this. It's a counterbalance and argument that I've already backed off myself.

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 Again, this is so weird. This is so weird.

429
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,080
 We have this story of Zinn wrong who probably did, you know, jump out of a plane.

430
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 This happened just this year, July 29th, 2022 in North Carolina at the Raleigh Durham International Airport.

431
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,080
 Two pilots are flying a plane. They've been doing skydiving runs all morning.

432
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,080
 The pilot in command, his name's been redacted from these reports. Maybe he's an alien. Maybe he's an alien. I don't know.

433
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:17,080
 Pilot in command is how he's listed. He was the pilot in command. His name has been redacted from all these 911 calls and FAA reports and stuff like that.

434
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,080
 He's flying with this other pilot, this guy named Charles Hugh Crooks. He's 23 years old.

435
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,080
 It's just a nice sunny summer day in North Carolina.

436
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,080
 Charles is flying the plane and they're landing at the airport.

437
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,080
 And what happens is they start to come in below the tree line and they're coming in too low.

438
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:47,080
 So they have to pull up and as the plane is pulling back up, one of their landing gear catches onto the runway and breaks.

439
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,080
 It breaks off. And so they fly up back into the sky.

440
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
 And at that point, the pilot in command goes, "Okay, here, I'm going to take over."

441
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:01,080
 And he radios into the control tower. He goes, "Hey, can you guys, we're going to fly around the airport.

442
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,080
 Can you guys give us a visual on how damaged our landing gear is?"

443
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,080
 And at this point, there's people running out onto the runway and they are like looking at it with binoculars and stuff.

444
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,080
 And they go, "Yeah, yeah, it is damaged. Like you actually did take some damage. We're seeing some debris on the field."

445
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,080
 So the pilot in command goes, "Okay, we're going to do an emergency landing. Be prepared for this. We're going to do emergency landing."

446
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 So the plane is coming back around to land.

447
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 And Charles, he's sitting in the... They're both sitting in the cockpit, right? Charles is sitting in the seat. He stands up.

448
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:42,080
 He takes off his headset and turns to the pilot in command and goes, "I'm really, really, really sorry."

449
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,080
 The pilot in command is still flying this plane and Charles leaves the cockpit, walks to the back because it's a four-skidiving, right?

450
00:27:49,080 --> 00:28:01,080
 They have that little drawbridge thing in the back of the plane. He's walking to the back of the plane. He opens the plane up and jumps out.

451
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,080
 He didn't have a parachute on. Should I have said that part earlier? He didn't have a parachute on.

452
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:11,080
 He wasn't like, "Weee!" Last one to the ground is a rotten egg. He jumped out of the plane.

453
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:21,080
 No parachute on and the pilot's flying the plane and he realizes what's going on and he calls it in. He's like, "I think my copilot just jumped out."

454
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,080
 They're like, "What? What? What?" He goes, "Yeah, I think my copilot just left the plane."

455
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 And the plane lands. They have all this stuff. They have the FAA communications. They have the calls to 911.

456
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,080
 And apparently school was just getting out. I was looking over some of the 911 transcripts. School was just getting out.

457
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,080
 So like, he had police cars and fire department and medic crews looking for this guy.

458
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,080
 A couple hours later, they found him in a backyard of someone's house. Dead. He's dead.

459
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:04,080
 So the idea of someone jumping out of a plane to kill themselves, however odd it is, it happens.

460
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 It does happen. It's just so weird. I mean, both of them are weird. I'm not gonna say I'm a weirdo meter.

461
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,080
 "Zin-Rong" is way more bizarre. It's still a bizarre story. It's creepy.

462
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 And that's such a... Okay, I'm gonna start talking about aliens again. I'm gonna start talking about aliens again.

463
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:31,080
 And that is probably not what happened, but the fact that this plane was just flying through the night sky, completely unmanned, could have done a lot of damage, right?

464
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:38,080
 And I don't know anything about "Zin-Rong." A lot of times, unless it's some sort of murder/suicide or some sort of like mass shooting,

465
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,080
 the suicide victims try to limit how much damage they do to others.

466
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,080
 I remember when my dad will end it with this particularly depressing story.

467
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,080
 I remember my dad, he used to own a crematory. He called me up one night. It was not like eight or nine, right?

468
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,080
 This was probably like 10, 15 years ago. I'm sitting at home. My dad calls me up.

469
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:07,080
 And we start chatting and stuff like that. And he goes, "Hey, I wanted to just tell you that I loved you."

470
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 Stuff like that. And he didn't actually say stuff like that. He was telling me that.

471
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 And then I could tell, like, it was weird that he would call me so late at night, so I figured it was something a little more than just wanting to chat.

472
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:33,080
 But he said that earlier that evening, he had gone to do a body pickup. And he said, "I went into this apartment and this guy reminded me of you."

473
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:40,080
 "This guy reminded me of you. He kind of looked like you and he was a really nice guy."

474
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,080
 And he wound to explain what he meant by that because obviously my dad's there. The guy's dead.

475
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:54,080
 Then I had to leave a personality test open on his laptop or anything. My dad says, "I walked into this apartment and there was this guy and he looked like you."

476
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:14,080
 And he had shot himself in the head. But he had put stuff behind him. He had built like a little buffer zone behind his head so the bullet wouldn't fly through his own skull and then possibly injure someone in another apartment.

477
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:24,080
 Like, even in his last moments, he was thinking of other people. And my dad started crying.

478
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 And I think that is fairly typical. Not that my dad's a big crybaby, but I do think that's fairly typical.

479
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,080
 A lot of times when people kill themselves, they're trying to end their own lives, not others.

480
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,080
 And so going back to the Zin wrong thing, like, who knows? Maybe he fell out of the plane.

481
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 Maybe he left a detailed suicide note. Maybe he was abducted by aliens.

482
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:56,080
 We don't know, but a bizarre mystery nonetheless. Or a tragic answerable. What's the opposite of a mystery?

483
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 A tragic truth. A bizarre mystery or a tragic truth.

484
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,080
 We'll never know. Actually, we will know it's the tragic truth. We keep trying to make it all mysterious. Let's wrap this up.
