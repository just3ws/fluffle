1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 When a young man is house sitting for his parents, he has no idea that a disturbing secret is

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,500
 just a VHS tape away.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,740
 And then we travel to the west coast.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,740
 Yeah dude.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,120
 We're not out here to surf, we're not out here to pick up on some California girls.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,660
 We're here to explore the maze of tunnels that lie underneath the state of California.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:35,760
 Is it possible that this unending network of catacombs may actually spell doom for the

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,560
 entire west coast?

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:51,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
 I hope you guys are staying warm.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,480
 These last few episodes I have not needed to run an air conditioner for 20 minutes

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
 before I step into this closet.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
 I'm doing quite fine and pretty soon I'm gonna spend 30 episodes talking about how cold

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
 it is.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,920
 But someone who I will never complain about walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 Give it up for one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Christian!

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
 Woohoo!

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,160
 Yeah, come on in Christian.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
 Christian D.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
 To be specific.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,920
 Christian, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,160
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
 I trust me, I do.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,560
 There's a lot of people that I love out there that I don't support financially.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,600
 But what I do is I make sure I tell people about them because that is another way to

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 support the show.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 I'm a huge fan of Omeracker.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,520
 I talk about him all the time on this paranormal podcast.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,080
 They mentioned him a dozen times.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
 He's my favorite streamer.

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,960
 He does Dead by Daylight streams and horror video game streams on YouTube.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
 So there you go.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,600
 Yeah, that's how easy it was.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
 All you have to do is start a podcast and mention me.

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,200
 Christian, let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,920
 Let's hop on the handlebars and he's gonna pedal us all the way out to a suburban house.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,200
 Put that Yu-Gi-Oh card in the spokes.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,240
 Riding on out to this house in the middle of the suburbs.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,920
 In this house we're gonna meet a young man.

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
 He didn't post his name.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
 Online he goes by name.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,280
 I think this was a throwaway username he set up.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,280
 But he goes by extremely confused 1, 2, 3.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,240
 I think it was just a throwaway.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,280
 We're gonna go ahead and call you Bobby.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,360
 Bobby, he was born with only one arm.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
 Which is fine, right?

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 I think if you're born missing a limb it's actually pretty easy for you to get used to

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,560
 it.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,520
 Bobby is house sitting for his parents.

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,720
 They're away on vacation and they said, "Hey, can you feed the animals and you know make

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,640
 sure nobody breaks into the house in that order.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,160
 First off, make sure our animals are fat.

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,560
 Secondly, make sure no one steals our television set."

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
 He's there.

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
 He's house sitting.

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
 You know, I love house sitting personally.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,280
 It's like a mini vacation for my son.

63
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,600
 I'll house sit at the drop of a hat.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,840
 I love it.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,720
 But it can also be super boring if you're not a pro at it like me.

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,040
 I've done a lot of house sitting over the years.

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,840
 I love it.

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
 But he's not a pro like me.

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
 He's not a pro like me.

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,100
 He gets bored pretty quickly.

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,520
 One day he gets off work and he goes back to his parents house and he's like, "What

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,600
 do I do?

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 What do I do?"

74
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,800
 And there's different levels of boredom.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,720
 But this might be the lowest level of boredom possible outside of just sitting in the rain

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,760
 with your head back and your mouth open.

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,640
 This might be the second lowest form of boredom.

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,880
 He decides to watch some home movies.

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:56,620
 He gets this big box of VHS tapes and puts one in.

80
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
 Starts playing.

81
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,140
 It's a video of him riding a bike.

82
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,620
 He's watching himself ride this bicycle and he's like, "Way to go, younger me."

83
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
 But he gets bored.

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,700
 That'd be super boring to watch yourself ride a bike.

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,540
 So then he puts in a tape of a Christmas morning.

86
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,560
 "Mom, look what I got.

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
 I got the TIE Fighter with Darth Vader action figure."

88
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,600
 "That you did, Bobby.

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
 You were a good boy this year.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,560
 Santa sure does love you."

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 And Bobby's like, "Yay!"

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,160
 And he's flying around with his TIE Fighter.

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 That's pretty cool, right?

94
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
 Are you living that memory?

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,000
 Time to put in another video cassette though.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,400
 VCR starts playing this old tape.

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,500
 "The only thing cringier than being in a school play is watching one.

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 And the only thing cringier than that is watching one 20 years later."

99
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,300
 I can't imagine watching any school plays I was in.

100
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,420
 And I was in, not many.

101
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,980
 I was the arms of the Grinch villain in...

102
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,140
 Who's the one with the arms?

103
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,780
 You're like, "Jayson, every Doctor's News story has arms in it."

104
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
 No.

105
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,480
 The one Danny DeVito ended up destroying the environment.

106
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 They made a movie of it recently.

107
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,880
 Well in the movie, in the book where Danny DeVito is this little guy who wants to destroy

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,200
 the environment, there's a pair of arms in it, right?

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,520
 There's a pair of green arms that are like, "Ha ha ha ha.

110
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,080
 It was I who really wanted to destroy the environment, Danny DeVito.

111
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
 You were doing my bidding all along."

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,240
 You're like, "Jayson, no.

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,820
 It's clearly either a psychotic break or a Mandela effect.

114
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,340
 I have no idea what you're talking about."

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,860
 Well anyways, I remember I was a school play.

116
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,740
 I was the arms.

117
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,340
 I was offstage with these green arms and I would stick them out on stage and I would

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
 read the script.

119
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
 Ha ha ha ha.

120
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,540
 Danny, I kept calling him Danny DeVito people.

121
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
 Like what?

122
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,540
 The star of Taxi.

123
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,980
 Why do you keep calling this character Danny DeVito?

124
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,940
 I go, "You'll see.

125
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
 Give it 30 years.

126
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,320
 I can predict the future, but only the future of Danny DeVito's career."

127
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
 I was the arms.

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,820
 I was the green arm guy.

129
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,240
 Anyways, cringy to watch it after the show, cringy to watch it even 20 years later, but

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,840
 this guy is so bored that he's watching school.

131
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,800
 He's watching himself in school plays.

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,600
 Well, he grabs another tape, puts it in the VCR, starts watching it.

133
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,540
 It's a video of his grandpa holding his older brother as a baby.

134
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,260
 He's not from last year.

135
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,540
 The grandpa's like bench pressing the older brother.

136
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,540
 Ha ha ha.

137
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
 I told you I was starting to menu.

138
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,900
 It was a video of the grandpa holding his older brother as a baby and the grandpa's like,

139
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,900
 "Oh, look at you.

140
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,780
 Someday I'm gonna bench press you."

141
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,340
 But not today.

142
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,820
 He's holding the baby brother and Bobby's like, "Oh my God, this is so boring.

143
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,620
 What is going on?

144
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,120
 Why am I having such a hard time passing the time?

145
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
 Passing the time.

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
 This is incredibly boring."

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,120
 And then he's watching this video of his older brother as a baby and the grandpa goes, "Aren't

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,920
 you a cute little baby?

149
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,120
 Bobby, you got your dad's eyes.

150
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,320
 You're so adorable, Bobby."

151
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,400
 Bobby's ears kind of perk up and he's watching this video and the grandpa's holding this

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,280
 baby.

153
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,760
 And then he hears another voice in the video.

154
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,740
 Someone's going, "Oh yeah, no, Bobby sure is a big boy, aren't you Bobby?

155
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,260
 You're gonna be a big strong boy."

156
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,100
 Bobby realizes two things in really quick succession.

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,340
 That's not his older brother.

158
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,340
 That's him as a baby.

159
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,420
 That's Bobby as a tiny little baby boy.

160
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:59,120
 And the boy in the video has two arms.

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,880
 He said the very next video he could find timeline-wise of himself was age three.

162
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,520
 He only had one arm now.

163
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,800
 And that's all the info we have.

164
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
 Like again, this was a throwaway account.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,320
 He does mention, "Should I ask my parents?

166
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,700
 Like where do I take this?

167
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,820
 I clearly had two arms when I was born.

168
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,020
 But I've been told my entire life I've only had one.

169
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,660
 That there was a birth defect and I only had one arm.

170
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,100
 But I see proof.

171
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,300
 I see proof that that's not true.

172
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,020
 I see myself as an infant with two arms.

173
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,460
 So what do I do with this information?

174
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,420
 Do I ask my parents?

175
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,800
 Do I confront them?

176
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,440
 When they deny it, do I show them the video?

177
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,080
 What do I do?

178
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,480
 Now, at this point, you figure he's an adult because he's not living with his parents.

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
 He's house-sitting for them.

180
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
 He has another residence and he's house-sitting for them.

181
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,920
 So maybe he's in call.

182
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
 He has work.

183
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 He doesn't mention going to school.

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,300
 It's possible that this guy is in his mid-20s, early 30s even.

185
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,300
 So whatever story he had been told, he'd been told it for decades.

186
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,860
 And he 100% believed it.

187
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,260
 I was only born with one arm.

188
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,140
 Why is there a video of a baby that they're calling him by his name, not his older brother's

189
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
 name?

190
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,580
 They're calling this baby by his name, Bobby.

191
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,780
 The baby has two arms.

192
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,940
 What do I do with that information?

193
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,540
 This is a super interesting story.

194
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
 It could be creepypasta.

195
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,800
 It could be a short story that someone is writing in this type of medium.

196
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
 But it's also possible that families keep secrets.

197
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:57,360
 I know dozens of family secrets, not just my own, but those of my friends.

198
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,560
 Because I'm good at keeping secrets.

199
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,040
 And that's a reputation you only earn over time.

200
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,280
 And that's a reputation you can end very, very quickly.

201
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
 I don't gossip.

202
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,180
 Your friends of mine can tell that I don't gossip.

203
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,700
 I've never walked up to Josh and say, "Hey, you want to hear something that somebody told

204
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
 me that they told me never to tell anyone?"

205
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,540
 Josh's just like, "Uh, because he wouldn't know if I told--" He probably wouldn't want

206
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,100
 to hear that, but he wouldn't know if I told him that he would never trust me with another

207
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
 secret.

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,900
 And I know all your secrets, Josh.

209
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
 I know tons of secrets.

210
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,260
 I know tons of secrets because I keep my mouth shut.

211
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,340
 And families keep secrets.

212
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,080
 So it's not out of the realm of possibility that something happened to this boy between

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,000
 birth and age three that the family decided not to tell him about.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,120
 Some people responded to this, and they said, "It's possible that the story is half true."

215
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,920
 Not the narrative, but the fact that there are medical conditions where you can be born

216
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,820
 with two arms, but then there's a deformity inside the arm where they did have to remove

217
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
 it.

218
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,300
 It wasn't going to continue to function.

219
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,660
 It might have had something wrong with it.

220
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,040
 It might have had something that would be life-threatening.

221
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,860
 So the story is half true.

222
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,840
 You were only born with one arm, technically only one working arm or only one viable arm.

223
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,480
 You saw that theory pop up a bit.

224
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,160
 But this baby looked like it had two healthy arms.

225
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,800
 He actually thought it was his older brother when he first saw the video.

226
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,960
 Wasn't one of the arms gangrene or anything like that.

227
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
 But I mean, maybe it was internal, right?

228
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,320
 It's a possibility that they were telling half the truth, that the arm wouldn't have

229
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,040
 survived if they left it on there.

230
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
 It would cause more complications so they had it removed.

231
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
 It's possible.

232
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,240
 And I know, again, because of family secrets that I know from my own family and from other

233
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,760
 people's families, that at a certain point you make a decision, I'm just never going

234
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
 to tell them.

235
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,560
 Like, it's a secret you keep from them as a kid.

236
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,240
 And then they get a little bit older and you go, "Oh, you know, I'll tell it when, you

237
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
 know, they're a teenager.

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
 I'll tell them about it."

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,040
 I'll tell them when they're 18, when they're an adult, and then that kind of thing.

240
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,560
 You know, I'll tell them when they have a family of their own.

241
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,480
 But at that point, I mean, what's the point of even telling them, right?

242
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,520
 But we don't know how this story wrapped up.

243
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,800
 We don't know if he ever talked to his parents.

244
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,200
 You would want, like in my case, had that happened to me.

245
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,400
 But I only had one arm.

246
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
 I wasn't allowed to be the green arm guy.

247
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,880
 They're like, "Jason, you're a really good actor, but this part requires two arms."

248
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,360
 And then I found out that I used to have two arms.

249
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,840
 I probably, I don't know what I would do because at the end of the day, if you ask your parents,

250
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,400
 if you confront them with this, whether or not the answer is, "Well, you were born with

251
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,840
 a bad arm and we had to do these procedures and you weren't going to have it for a long

252
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,880
 anyway so we had it amputated," or "You had a horrible accident and it was amputated,"

253
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 or they go, "What?

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,520
 You only have one arm and they pretend like you always had two arms until just now?"

255
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,200
 And you're asking the question, "It becomes an even bigger lie?"

256
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,480
 That's the thing, like at the end of the day, the confrontation's going to be, "You lied

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,920
 to me for decades about something so intensely personal."

258
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,000
 And it's not like it changed his life.

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,880
 It's not like he would have lived his life any differently if he was born without an

260
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,800
 arm or if he had lost an arm.

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,080
 I mean, maybe if, the only thing I can think of, if it was removed by some sort of violent

262
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,520
 altercation, like his older brother accidentally chopped his arm up.

263
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,840
 His older brother pushed him into a lawn mower or something like that.

264
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,160
 And it would cause him to resent a family member.

265
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,520
 An uncle was swinging him around by his arms and one of the arms came off, you know how

266
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,000
 strong your uncle is.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
 It would cause resentment.

268
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,600
 That's the only thing I can think of.

269
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 If it was a procedure, if it was something like, "Yes, son, you were born," because kids

270
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,920
 would obviously ask, "Why am I different than the other kids?"

271
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,560
 And you can go, "Well, you were born with two arms but then one of them had some issues

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,800
 with it so we had to have it removed when you were a kid.

273
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 You don't remember that."

274
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,840
 And that's one thing, like you could actually have that.

275
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,280
 The only reason why I think they would cover it up is if they feared that he would be angry

276
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,800
 at the person who accidentally or on purpose damaged his arm enough that required it to

277
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 be removed.

278
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
 But it's a creepy story because at the end of the day, he now knows something.

279
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,720
 He now knows a deep truth that has been hidden from him for a very, very long time.

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,040
 A intensely personal truth about himself.

281
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,320
 He was born with two arms but he lost one.

282
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,040
 And he doesn't even know how.

283
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 He doesn't even know how he lost his arm.

284
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,120
 But it's more than that.

285
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,840
 It's not just that he lost the arm.

286
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,920
 It's the fact that his entire family lied to him about it.

287
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 Fascinating story.

288
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,680
 I hate to be in that guy's shoes, obviously, because you would learn a lot about your family

289
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,600
 all because you grabbed a box of video cassettes and started putting them in one board afternoon.

290
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,120
 Christian, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carvernercopter.

291
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,400
 We are leaving behind this house.

292
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:28,960
 Take us all the way out to California.

293
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
 California.

294
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,120
 It's the land of surf, sun and celebrities.

295
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,560
 I heard that you also might be able to catch a glimpse of a green armed boy.

296
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,960
 Green armed elementary school student preparing for his play if you were somewhere in the

297
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,720
 state of California in the late 80s.

298
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
 I guess it would have been in the Bay Area at that point.

299
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,680
 So maybe you could have gotten a green armed autograph if you had been thinking ahead.

300
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,760
 But we're not here to time travel.

301
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,280
 We're not here to meet elementary school Jason.

302
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,640
 We're here to talk about, whoa, oh no dude.

303
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,120
 All of a sudden everything starts shaking.

304
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,080
 Whoa dude.

305
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
 We're in the middle of an earthquake.

306
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,800
 We're in the middle of an earthquake and we got bit by a surfer.

307
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,680
 Now we have become a surfer.

308
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,960
 Totally not tubular man.

309
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,640
 The San Andreas Fault has become active.

310
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
 This is the big one.

311
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,200
 This is the earthquake everyone was afraid of in California.

312
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
 Whoa, no way dude.

313
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,000
 Watch out for that building and stuff.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,640
 And we're running through the streets of the Bay Area and people are falling out of windows.

315
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,080
 And then cars are getting all crazy.

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
 That guy was drunk.

317
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 That guy was a drunk driver.

318
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,400
 He didn't even know it's an earthquake.

319
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,560
 He's running over a bunch of people.

320
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,160
 We're like watch out.

321
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,040
 And we see the Golden Gate Bridge swinging back and forth and people are getting flung

322
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
 off of it.

323
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,240
 We're like no, it's the big one.

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,440
 This is the earthquake we're always worried about.

325
00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:02,320
 And all of a sudden the entire city of San Francisco breaks off and begins to plummet

326
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,160
 downwards.

327
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,540
 And we're immediately thrown to the ground.

328
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,640
 Not because we're ducking and covering.

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,320
 We're actually being held down by the gravitational pull of the entire city of San Francisco

330
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:22,000
 as it plummets towards the center of the earth.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,040
 This is something we were never taught in earthquake class.

332
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,840
 We were taught that the ground's going to shake for a couple seconds, maybe a minute,

333
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,840
 which would be the worst that it's like the biggest earthquake.

334
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,920
 And then you find out if you're dead or alive.

335
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,520
 We weren't told that the entire city could actually break off and begin to fall.

336
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,840
 But that's what's happening right now.

337
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,720
 We find ourselves in a massive pit inside the earth.

338
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,760
 The city of San Francisco is no more.

339
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,080
 It's just dust, rubble, and bodies as far as the eye can see.

340
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,720
 But we're not looking around anymore.

341
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:16,760
 We're looking up and we can see sunlight coming in through that mile-wide hole.

342
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,640
 The waters of the bay begin to pour over the edges of this massive gap.

343
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,400
 And we look up as tons of water are headed straight towards us.

344
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,760
 So water's coming towards us.

345
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,440
 We figure, well, this is the end.

346
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 Thanks for listening.

347
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,760
 Thanks for listening to my podcast.

348
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,440
 Thanks for traveling with me to San Francisco on this particular day.

349
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
 We think that it's over.

350
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,760
 We definitely know it's over for us.

351
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,600
 We're about to get drowned and/or crushed at the same time.

352
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,560
 But then we hear another rumbling.

353
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,480
 And that's when we realize it's not just the city of San Francisco.

354
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,360
 That broke off and plummeted into a massive cave system.

355
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:11,200
 The entire west coast is about to break off and sink into the catacombs.

356
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,320
 This is a theory put forth by an unnamed high-ranking naval officer.

357
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
 Which kind of makes sense, right?

358
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
 If you're going to be anonymous, you're like, "By the way, I'm

359
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
 also president of the United States."

360
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 You're like, "What?

361
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 You're not the president of the United States?"

362
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 That's what they've been saying.

363
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,840
 But they just need to count those votes more.

364
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,160
 If I was going to pretend to be anyone, if I was a naval officer and I'm like a lieutenant,

365
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,480
 I would be like, "By the way, I'm an admiral.

366
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
 I'm an admiral."

367
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,040
 But anyways, this unnamed naval officer, this high-ranking unnamed naval officer, tells

368
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,880
 a journalist for the Paranormal Magazine Search Magazine.

369
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,560
 Just came out on their fall 1985 issue that the San Andres Fault is not real.

370
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,320
 The San Andres Fault is not real.

371
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,160
 It's actually a cover story.

372
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
 The earthquakes are real.

373
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,440
 That plague California, but it's not because of the San Andres Fault.

374
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,440
 Just off the continental shelf out in the Pacific Ocean are access points, entrances,

375
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:20,000
 to a massive and seemingly unending network of caves.

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,160
 And these caves extend hundreds and hundreds of miles inland to the point that if you went

377
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,280
 into these underwater caves, you would be underneath the state of California before

378
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,200
 you even reached the ending of these caves.

379
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 And that's the issue.

380
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,120
 We don't even know how far these caves go.

381
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,400
 In fact, the Navy once sent a nuclear-powered sub into these caves, because we were trying

382
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,640
 to map them.

383
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,600
 We're trying to map them.

384
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
 And the sub never came out.

385
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,600
 We lost all communication with them, and they never came out.

386
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,520
 So they may have gotten lost and ran out of fuel.

387
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,680
 They may have crashed into something, had some sort of accident.

388
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,960
 For all we know, they got attacked by something under there.

389
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
 But a sub went in and never came out.

390
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,560
 In fact, the unnamed source said, "If I told you the name of the submarine, you would know

391
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
 it."

392
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,800
 You're like, "Red October?

393
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,720
 That's only submarine I know."

394
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
 He goes, "You would know the name of the submarine if I told you that, but I'm not

395
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,800
 going to tell you the name of it."

396
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,960
 The Naval officer goes on to say, "There is proof that there are these massive tunnels

397
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,760
 underneath the state of California, that it's not as firm as people say it is in the city

398
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,880
 of Long Beach when they began drilling oil, pumping oil out of the surrounding areas of

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,760
 Long Beach.

400
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,000
 The city sank.

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,480
 The city of Long Beach actually sank nearly 26 feet into an existing pit before they stopped

402
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
 pumping the oil.

403
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,560
 They had to stop pumping the oil because not only was it causing the city of Long Beach

404
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:07,320
 to destroy itself, it would also reveal the fact that there's nothing underneath a fairly

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,560
 thin crust, geologically speaking, a fairly thin crust running throughout the state of

406
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,320
 California and possibly up to Canada.

407
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,560
 They haven't fully been able to explore all of these tunnels.

408
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,600
 They know there's a ton of them under California, but because they can't go all the way through

409
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,320
 them, it may go through Oregon and Washington as well, and possibly even further.

410
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,280
 A super interesting story.

411
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
 Super interesting story.

412
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,480
 It kind of is in the middle of a full on-hollow-earth type of story, but there's no mention of

413
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,760
 like advanced civilizations or a submarine found a chamber full of a thousand royal coffins,

414
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
 which I like those stories.

415
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,600
 Don't get me wrong, I like those stories, but this story is kind of in between those.

416
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,680
 It has no mention of any of the normally bizarre and Atlantean level societies that we see

417
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,480
 in hollow-earth type stories.

418
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,200
 It just is there's tunnels under there, and we don't know what's in there.

419
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
 We've tried exploring them.

420
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
 We actually lost the sub.

421
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,960
 We don't know how long they are.

422
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,600
 And then the city of Long Beach actually began to sink into one of these chambers and they

423
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,880
 stopped pumping oil.

424
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
 Super interesting.

425
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
 I really wanted to verify this story.

426
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,920
 So I started looking around and you can find that article posted almost verbatim a couple

427
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
 different places.

428
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,680
 So that really wasn't helping me fact check it.

429
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,320
 It was just repeating the same thing.

430
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,200
 I eventually, so I knew that it was published in the fall issue of Search Magazine for the

431
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,280
 year 1985.

432
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,640
 Eventually, doing some more research, I found out Search Magazine was from the same publisher

433
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,160
 as Fate Magazine.

434
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,920
 And Fate Magazine, especially in the early days, has a really bad reputation.

435
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,040
 Fate Magazine was one of the, I don't know if it was the first, but it was definitely

436
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,520
 one of the biggest paranormal magazines, came out of the 50s.

437
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
 It continues today.

438
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,800
 I believe it's been a long time since I've read an issue, but Fate Magazine, if you had

439
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:08,600
 a Venn diagram of Fate Magazine journalists and science fiction authors, it's almost just

440
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 a circle.

441
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,000
 Like you do have, especially in the early issues, they published a lot of very fantastical

442
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 stuff.

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,600
 And I say fantastical, I mean, it was made up by a science fiction author.

444
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,220
 And I think over time, new editors have been like, no, no, let's actually make this a

445
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,240
 serious investigation of the world of the paranormal.

446
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,520
 So that is Search Magazine's lineage, right?

447
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
 Search Magazine came from that same publisher.

448
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,680
 But it's interesting, I found this story, I go, let's see what we can fact check on it.

449
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
 Because there's a couple key details.

450
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,720
 Long Beach sinking.

451
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
 True.

452
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,640
 True.

453
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
 The article actually underestimated it.

454
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,080
 It turns out that the city of Long Beach actually sank 29 feet.

455
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,080
 29 feet because there are pumping oil.

456
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,120
 They don't say it's because there are these massive, unmapped tunnels underneath California.

457
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,400
 They say it's caused by something called "substance."

458
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,560
 And basically, the city of Long Beach is built on soft sediment that hasn't been there for

459
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,040
 millions and millions of years.

460
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,040
 So it hasn't really created a hard crust.

461
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:23,920
 Like the rest of the world, it's almost sitting on soil and then oil.

462
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,040
 So they were pumping oil and the city was sinking and how they fixed that.

463
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,200
 Because like buildings were cracking, the road was breaking, bridges were snapping.

464
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,400
 The way they, because they're still pumping oil, they haven't stopped pumping oil.

465
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,240
 Now when they pump oil, they have to replace it with water.

466
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,560
 They have to keep that buoyancy underneath the soil.

467
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,400
 So that fact-check drew on that when the city of Long Beach actually did fall apart.

468
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,160
 The other thing we can fact-check on, nuclear sub goes missing.

469
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,360
 And he said it would be a sub that you would recognize.

470
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,080
 Now that would be something of the time, right?

471
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,680
 Nowadays, I don't think most people can name a nuclear sub.

472
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
 I couldn't.

473
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,360
 Right October, right?

474
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,640
 Well apparently back in 1963, there was the USS Thresher.

475
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,840
 It was a nuclear sub that went missing.

476
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,160
 They eventually found it though.

477
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,720
 It sunk off the coast of Massachusetts.

478
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,800
 So literally about as far from the west coast you can get.

479
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,560
 He could have been referring to that nuclear sub.

480
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,240
 But then I found, this is so interesting.

481
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
 I'm looking at the story.

482
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,200
 I go, this is pretty cool, but I want to find more details.

483
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,840
 Then I found something that not only did the search magazine article just completely gloss

484
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,480
 over, but the world of the paranormal.

485
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,800
 I've never heard this story before.

486
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,080
 This is so weird.

487
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
 And sure, it could be total coincidence.

488
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,360
 But especially in light to last Friday's episode when I talked about is Congress just investigating

489
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,960
 UFOs to kind of steal money from taxpayers and give it to other projects that they don't

490
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,480
 want to say that they run.

491
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,160
 They want to move more coke from South America to LA, turn it into a crack.

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
 Let's not make the money traceable.

493
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
 We'll say we're investigating UFOs.

494
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
 We'll really give it to the CIA.

495
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,280
 It would be a perfect way to move money around.

496
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,600
 But then let's take a look at this.

497
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 This is so interesting.

498
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,040
 I'm surprised this isn't bigger, a bigger conspiracy theory.

499
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
 Talking about submarines missing.

500
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,520
 I found this.

501
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,240
 This is well known among like nautical heads, right?

502
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,920
 Note boys, is what they call themselves?

503
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,400
 January 25, 1968.

504
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:46,680
 The INS Dakar in Israeli submarine disappears off the coast of Crete.

505
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,360
 So it's floating around in the Mediterranean.

506
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,120
 Disappears.

507
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,760
 No one has any idea why they can't get ahold of the Dakar.

508
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:11,800
 Two days later, January 27, 1968, the French submarine Minerva goes missing off the coast

509
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,760
 of France.

510
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,680
 The Navy has lost all communication with the submarine.

511
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
 It's gone.

512
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,200
 March 8, 1968.

513
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:33,440
 Soviet submarine K-129 goes missing.

514
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,360
 May 22, 1968.

515
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:46,440
 The USS Scorpion, a nuclear-powered US submarine, goes missing.

516
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,040
 This is a 100% true story.

517
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,560
 100% true story.

518
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:59,320
 You have four submarines from four different countries go missing in a five-month period

519
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,400
 in 1968.

520
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,920
 They do eventually find all of these submarines.

521
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,160
 K-129 is found in August of that year.

522
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,880
 The Scorpion is found in October of that year.

523
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,800
 The Dakar is not located until the year 2000.

524
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,600
 And the Minerva isn't found until 2019.

525
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,880
 Now some of them were in the general location of where they believed that they went down.

526
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,560
 And I think that was the French submarine they found in the Gulf of Lyon.

527
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:44,280
 But a lot of them were hundreds of kilometers away from any search party.

528
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:49,960
 When they found these submarines, obviously they wanted to know what happened.

529
00:29:49,960 --> 00:30:01,680
 To this day, there is no confirmed reason of why four submarines all sank in a five-month

530
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,520
 period.

531
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:09,680
 You can look and there's a dozen theories for each individual submarine.

532
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,400
 Maybe it was this, maybe it was that, maybe it was this, maybe it was that.

533
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,480
 Because now they can have divers going there, they have photographs of these.

534
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,440
 They can see where they've broken apart some of these submarines.

535
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,120
 But they don't know why.

536
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
 Was it an accident?

537
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,760
 Some of them, they think it was an attack.

538
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,600
 You have to think of the very first when the Israeli submarine went down, you'd think sabotage.

539
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,440
 And when the French submarine went down, you'd think, is it the Soviets attacking the West?

540
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,840
 But when the Soviet submarine goes down and the US submarine goes down, now you realize

541
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,640
 four countries have all lost their submarine in a five-month period.

542
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,040
 And the US submarine, the nuclear-powered submarine, is still down there with its full nuclear-powered

543
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,760
 engine and full complement of nuclear warheads on it.

544
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,000
 It hasn't been moved, it's just down there.

545
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,560
 But even after all these years of study, they don't know what caused these explosions.

546
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,080
 They don't even know if it was an explosion, right?

547
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,160
 They don't know why all four of these submarines.

548
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,280
 This has never happened since.

549
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,960
 There has not been a time in any year, really before or after 1968, where you had four submarines

550
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
 go down in a year.

551
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,060
 Generally, it's huge news when a submarine sinks.

552
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,520
 If it's not some sort of top secret sub, remember the Kursk, that Soviet, I think it was Russian,

553
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,800
 it was the fall of the Soviet Union at that point, but that Russian subbed the Kursk sink.

554
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,240
 It had like 110 people on board, maybe more.

555
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,240
 And it was international news for like a week because they were trying to save those

556
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,480
 men.

557
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,160
 And that brings us to where we're back with this story, because while we can't say that

558
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:52,640
 the USS Scorpion was lost in this cave underneath California, that's when the unnamed officer

559
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,440
 said it would be a sub you would know of, it was very famous disasters, it was mysteries,

560
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
 right?

561
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,240
 What happened to the Thresher, what happened to the Scorpion, those would be the two nuclear-powered

562
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,000
 subs that he could have been referring to, but there was talk of what happened with the

563
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,440
 Kursk was it ran into something, that there was something underwater, some sort of other

564
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,840
 vehicle that it crashed into.

565
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,240
 And that's why it was stuck down there, because everyone perished, they weren't able to get

566
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,160
 the sub up in time.

567
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,680
 If memory serves me correctly, I think they eventually did retrieve the bodies, I could

568
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,400
 be wrong in that detail, but the idea was that it crashed into something.

569
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
 That's what the conspiracy sphere was talking about.

570
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,320
 I remember the Americans wanted to go out, the American government wanted to go out and

571
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 help with the recovery efforts, they said, "Listen, we have some of the best sub retrieval

572
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,200
 technology available, we invented it."

573
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,600
 And the Russians said, "No, we don't want your help."

574
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 And a lot of people have blamed the Russian government's reluctance to let the US government

575
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,320
 go out and help with the recovery, with the deaths of some of these young men.

576
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,200
 We also, listen, I'm not an idiot either, the US government wanted to go out there and

577
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,440
 help raise the submarine, and they would have taken a billion photographs and had a dude

578
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,720
 going, "Nit!" and pretending to be Russian and sneaking in on the sub.

579
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,880
 Like, 100%, it was a humanitarian mission and a spy mission at the same time.

580
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
 I'm not an idiot, right?

581
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,920
 We wanted to get photographs and measurements and all that stuff.

582
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,120
 But in the conspiracy sphere, and I'll see if I can find some links, because again, this

583
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,520
 would have been a long time ago, conspiracy websites, they always disappear, forums get

584
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 wiped every once in a while, but the idea was that the Kursk was actually following a

585
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,520
 USO, or an unidentified submerged object.

586
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,240
 It was tracking an alien vehicle, and it crashed into it.

587
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,400
 Like if I remember correctly, I could be wrong on this again, it's been almost an entire

588
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,880
 decade, decade and a half since I looked into it, but I think there was like track marks

589
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,080
 at the bottom of the floor bed.

590
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,720
 But anyways, it crashed into something.

591
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,580
 It's so interesting because on the episode I did on Friday, and you don't have to listen

592
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,840
 to it, but I'll put it in the show notes.

593
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,760
 The episode that I did on Friday, I said the government specifically looking at, the US

594
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,920
 government specifically in this congressional body that they formed to investigate UFOs,

595
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,000
 for lack of a better term, they believe they have a better term, the UAPs, but they're

596
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,840
 specifically looking at things called trans-medium objects, which are things that can go from

597
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,760
 the ocean to the sky to space.

598
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,640
 And I said on the show, I go, "That's so rare.

599
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,700
 Why would you be investigating something that is one of the smallest amounts of UFO sightings?

600
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,100
 Most of them are lights in the sky.

601
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,380
 Most of them are things within our atmosphere that are then going at incredible speeds in

602
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,820
 out of our atmosphere.

603
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
 Vestigate those."

604
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,100
 They're picking such a specific thing to look at, and I said, "Well, that way, when

605
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,980
 they can't find anything, they can go, 'Well, we didn't find anything.'"

606
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,660
 But they still took all of our money for years and years and years to fund these other projects

607
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,820
 they really wanted to fund off the books.

608
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,160
 That was kind of what my theory was.

609
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,320
 But it's possible that while we don't see, and I kind of addressed this on that episode

610
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,360
 as well, while the public doesn't see a lot of USOs or these trans-medium objects, because

611
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,000
 we don't spend a lot of time in the ocean, this could be something that the Navy is routinely

612
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,680
 dealing with, is things shooting up out of the water.

613
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,040
 We do have reports of them, they're just so rare.

614
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,320
 Things shooting out of the water or things flying through the sky and going into the

615
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
 water.

616
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,060
 Drones.

617
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,780
 Drones can't do that unless there's some super top secret drone.

618
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,820
 I know we have drone boats or drone subs and things like that, but being able to go from

619
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,100
 the sky into the water and then out of the water into the sky, that is technology we

620
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,260
 don't have.

621
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:10,300
 And I thought, what if this was an early encounter between US militaries and trans-medium objects?

622
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,640
 It took out four subs in five months.

623
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,440
 Like this would be a way that you would alert people to your presence.

624
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,400
 If one sub went down, tragic accident.

625
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,560
 If one sub went down every two or three years and one was from Israel, one was from France,

626
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,440
 and one was from Soviet Union, one was from US.

627
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,720
 Tragic accidents.

628
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,720
 But four subs from four countries in five months, that's a trend.

629
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,040
 And so interesting, I'm surprised I never heard about that before.

630
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,740
 They did find all the subs, but we still don't know what happened to them.

631
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,900
 And the fact that we had all these subs blow up or die or just fall apart within a five

632
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,780
 month period, that's extremely suspicious.

633
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,620
 That's definitely should be in the realm of the paranormal.

634
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,100
 It doesn't prove that tunnels underneath California theory, which is, it's an interesting theory,

635
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,380
 but it raises a whole other set of questions like what was happening in early 1968.

636
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,780
 And I'll say this, I'll say this.

637
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,620
 The other day, atomic being on YouTube, because I still read the YouTube comments, we still

638
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,800
 have a discussion there.

639
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,920
 Atomic being on the YouTube channel said, "I think that there is an agenda against the

640
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,280
 theory of ultra terrestrials."

641
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
 That's the idea that aliens are coming from other dimensions.

642
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,320
 Atomic being goes, "I actually think, because that theory gets dismissed so quickly, I feel

643
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,160
 like there's an agenda behind it."

644
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,720
 Ultra terrestrials, the idea that aliens are coming from another reality, explains so many

645
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,160
 things about aliens.

646
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,860
 It explains why their ships just appear out of nowhere.

647
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,780
 It explains why they can just start walking around in your bedroom.

648
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,460
 It explains how they travel such large distances because they're not, they're literally a

649
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,820
 universe away.

650
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:59,260
 Not scale wise, but the wall between their world and ours is thin.

651
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,900
 As opposed to if they're coming from Zeta reticuli, we know how far away that is.

652
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,540
 So then we have to do the math and invent technology to say, well, to get from Zeta

653
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,080
 reticuli to come here would be X-mini light years.

654
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
 But that takes too long.

655
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,240
 So we're going to invent faster than light travel, even though we have to jump through

656
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,200
 hoops for extra terrestrials.

657
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,960
 Ultra terrestrials make more sense.

658
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,600
 My belief is, and I think this is, it's not a conspiracy, it's just super basic, if the

659
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:32,200
 very first UFO novels, if War of the Worlds took place, not from aliens coming from Mars,

660
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,940
 but if it had been started off saying, "There was an alien creature in a reality just like

661
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,400
 our own," and they just appeared one day with these giant machines, and then the kids who

662
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,080
 are inspired by that book, when they're writing Flash Gordon, Flash Gordon doesn't have a

663
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,440
 rocket ship, he's not flying around space, he has a device that allows him to shift to

664
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,000
 the reality of the aliens.

665
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,120
 In each movie or each radio play, he would shift to another world.

666
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,400
 And then in Star Trek, they don't have a ship that they're flying around going other

667
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,040
 planets, they get in a device and they shift to an alien world and we're here to make contact.

668
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,060
 And all of that stuff, that's the reason why we believe in aliens, because our media says

669
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,380
 that.

670
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,180
 If War of the Worlds and Star Trek and Star Wars and Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon and

671
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,300
 all this stuff was about shifting to other dimensions to find aliens and beat them up

672
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,340
 or make love to them, the minority of people would believe, "No, I think there are aliens

673
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,900
 actually on another planet," because mainstream culture would say, "No, they're from another

674
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
 reality."

675
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,420
 And you'd have people go, "You know, I bet you that UFO is so I bet you that came from

676
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,040
 some planet way off there, people would laugh at you or they just wouldn't understand because

677
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,720
 media would have set them up to believe in ultra-terrestrials."

678
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,960
 Now there could have been an agenda behind that, that could have been created for a reason,

679
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,880
 but that's why, that's honestly why.

680
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,040
 We take what we get from the media and if War of the Worlds was the same book but they

681
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:03,620
 came from a sliver of reality into our own, the narrative would be different.

682
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,500
 But extraterrestrials, it's debatable whether or not they exist.

683
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,540
 Most people at this point say they do, but are they coming here?

684
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
 It's debatable.

685
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,540
 Ultra-terrestrials really takes a lot of brain power, because again, that's not the story

686
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,140
 that we've been fed since we were kids.

687
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,740
 We've been told that aliens can travel light years within a split second, but coming from

688
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,720
 another universe when you're talking about that's too weird.

689
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,520
 But the scariest of them all isn't the extra-terrestrials, it isn't the ultra-terrestrials, it's the

690
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
 terrestrials.

691
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,480
 And I don't mean that as man is the worst monster of all, no I'm not saying that.

692
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,640
 It would be the worst outcome for all of us, for governments and religions and just people

693
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,520
 walking around living their lives.

694
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,820
 If it turns out that every unidentified object we've seen in the sky, every alien abduction

695
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:05,200
 story, everything you know about UFOs and aliens are not from another planet, but they're

696
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,580
 from Earth and they actually evolved alongside of us.

697
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,420
 That would be the absolute worst.

698
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
 That would collapse thing.

699
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,700
 We always talk about well if aliens came down then people won't believe in religion

700
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
 anymore.

701
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
 No, it wouldn't happen.

702
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,080
 If aliens came down people would be rushing for their religion to explain the existence

703
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,280
 of aliens and then people would just accept that.

704
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:35,120
 If an alien ship came down there is nothing really in the scripture, at least in the Bible,

705
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,720
 that says aliens don't exist.

706
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,280
 There's no comment where they ever say aliens don't exist.

707
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,360
 You can all of a sudden start reinterpreting stuff when you say he created the world.

708
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,560
 Well what that really means is he created reality and that means there could be other

709
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
 aliens.

710
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,420
 The church has already admitted that there are aliens out there and it works with their

711
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
 faith.

712
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,940
 So I wouldn't change anything.

713
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,820
 It would probably have some economic.

714
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,660
 There would be societal shock.

715
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:08,340
 There would be shock among the world leaders that now there is a super powerful force floating

716
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,900
 above us.

717
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,740
 But they would be alien to us.

718
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,980
 You might be able to unite humanity against it.

719
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,800
 The worst would be if they were here all along and we thought we were the top of the food

720
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
 chain.

721
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,680
 We thought we were the masters of the planet and we weren't.

722
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,680
 If aliens come out of the sky, yeah it's totally awesome or totally terrifying depending

723
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
 on what type of aliens they are.

724
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,360
 But if they are actual natives to this planet, not coming from another dimension, not coming

725
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,800
 from another planet 10,000 years ago, anything like that.

726
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,260
 If they actually are native to this planet then it was all a charade.

727
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,400
 It would be the same thing if you have a cat and the cat goes this is my house and this

728
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,780
 family is here to feed me and to let me in when I want to come in.

729
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,440
 But all the humans know that the cat is not in charge.

730
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,340
 We let the cat pretend it's in charge?

731
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,660
 And the cat may wonder why certain things don't make sense from time to time.

732
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,120
 They'll be like wait a second I don't like this food, I'm not eating this food, how can

733
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
 they keep giving me this food?

734
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,480
 Don't they know that I'm in charge?

735
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,080
 I'm going to have to go to the neighbors house and eat their food or I'm going to have to

736
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,540
 start flipping over the dish so they 100% know I don't like this food but can't they

737
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,600
 tell I don't like this food?

738
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,720
 But for the most part the humans do indulge the cat.

739
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,240
 They pet it, they let it in and out when it needs to go in and out.

740
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,300
 They take care of it.

741
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,300
 But in this scenario we're the cat.

742
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,620
 We're the cat.

743
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:55,960
 And the aliens that that's not even the right term the terrestrials that have been flying

744
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,320
 around in these vehicles that are beyond our understanding that are abducting people out

745
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,260
 of houses and we don't know how they do it.

746
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,340
 Like I'm saying take everything you know about UFOology everything you know and that would

747
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:11,000
 make sense too why these aliens are always giving bad information why they're always

748
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,760
 talking about coming from Mars and Venus which we now know well definitely there's no life

749
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,200
 on Venus.

750
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,400
 It's because they're not going to be like oh no we live down the street dude we've actually

751
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,760
 lived down the street longer than you.

752
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,200
 We're the cat.

753
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,480
 We think we're in charge and the problem is is that the cat learns it's not in charge

754
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,560
 when the cat misbehaves.

755
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,820
 You might spray a little water in its face you might take a swing at it but when that

756
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,580
 cat misbehaves it gets put in its place and if it misbehaves too much what do you do?

757
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,300
 You get rid of the cat.

758
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,620
 If they walked among us as man was evolving in the first place they were evolving alongside

759
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,340
 of us and we just took different branches.

760
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:03,500
 Instead of having a massive war every 50 years and burning down each other's libraries they

761
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,600
 were united.

762
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,040
 That would be the scariest of all scenarios.

763
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:19,040
 That 100% that would upset a lot of the social order.

764
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:26,280
 As you can say religion doesn't say anything about aliens not existing on Gleap Glork but

765
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:33,040
 that's a pretty big omission if there is another sentient race on planet earth and no religion

766
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,580
 ever mentioned it.

767
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
 That's a pretty big omission.

768
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,540
 You could say when Jesus was talking to the apostles he didn't really care what was going

769
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,420
 on 50,000 light years away.

770
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,900
 They got their own Messiah.

771
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,420
 But it would be a huge omission if it turned out there is a sentient species numbering

772
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,620
 in 5 million that lives in these tunnels that crisscross throughout the world.

773
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,780
 But I'm not going to tell you about them even though they're here.

774
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,880
 That would be a pretty big omission.

775
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
 So I don't know.

776
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,440
 I mean again I've always been fascinated by the idea of just aliens in general but also

777
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,280
 ultra terrestrials but I have been a proponent of not necessarily hollow earth but there

778
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,080
 are massive unexplored cave systems all throughout the world and who knows what the caves are

779
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,800
 like underwater.

780
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:31,200
 All of the problems we have about going deep into the ocean is the pressure of the water

781
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,480
 on any vehicles we have.

782
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:40,140
 But the caves that are, if you had a cave that you found in Massachusetts and that cave

783
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,940
 you could follow it along and it took you underneath the Atlantic Ocean you wouldn't

784
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,100
 worry about the water pressure at all.

785
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,700
 You would be able to fit an entire civilization in a cave not a hollow earth not where you're

786
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,100
 floating around the core and everyone's getting tans because of the molten core.

787
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,220
 That is dumb.

788
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,780
 That's not possible.

789
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:03,880
 Which you could live between the crust and the mantle.

790
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,520
 You wouldn't even be there.

791
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,920
 You could live just under the crust.

792
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,200
 You could have a massive civilization just out of sight.

793
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,120
 And once you've perfected the technology you could zip around the Atlantic Ocean as much

794
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
 as you wanted.

795
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:25,600
 And if you weren't wiping out empires every hundred years and resetting the clock you could

796
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,640
 have a very advanced civilization.

797
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,100
 And that would be the worst case.

798
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,960
 That would be something that the government would never reveal.

799
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,060
 They would reveal that aliens come from outer space even if that wasn't true.

800
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,660
 Then ever admit that they'd been here alongside humans this entire time.

801
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,820
 Because it would be a mirror right?

802
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,820
 We could go ahead.

803
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,220
 How come we don't have that technology?

804
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,700
 Well maybe because we caused wars constantly.

805
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,740
 It's a fascinating story.

806
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,740
 That was a bit of a rant.

807
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,540
 I didn't mean to go off that much.

808
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,540
 You were talking about submarines and talking about these tunnels.

809
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,740
 I hope you enjoyed it.

810
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,940
 I do think that that would be the...

811
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,940
 I love the theory but that would be the scariest thing.

812
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,940
 Because it would.

813
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,100
 It would be like looking at your twin brother who achieved everything you ever wanted in

814
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,380
 life.

815
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,520
 Everything.

816
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,020
 They have it and you don't.

817
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:21,020
 It would be the cruelest joke if it turns out this entire time we'd been looking up

818
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,620
 at the night sky wondering if we're alone.

819
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,140
 When we never were, we were never alone not for a moment.

820
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,140
 There was always a sentient race right next to us.

821
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:44,740
 And they were better than us in every single way.

822
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,260
