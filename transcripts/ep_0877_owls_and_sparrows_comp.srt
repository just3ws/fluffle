00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,220
 Ghosts of Arizona Week continues as we take a look at two schools in Arizona that are

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,320
 currently haunted.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,960
 But these ghosts don't walk around rattling chains.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,520
 These ghosts remind us that practice makes perfect.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,840
 And then we travel to Cam Loops, British Columbia to take a look at two buddies who are spinning

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,320
 a nice quiet evening fishing.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,960
 But that quietness is broken when the lake is invaded by thousands of ducks today on

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:46,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,680
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and slide right into this walking into

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,720
 Dead Rabbit Command right now as one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,960
 Everyone give a nice warm round of applause for fellow content creator.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,440
 Yeah, come on in buddy, come on in.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,880
 He's been a long time supporter of the show.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
 Fellow content creator, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, I totally understand.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,520
 Just help us read the word about the show.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,280
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
 Now, fellow, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:36,000
 We're going to fly all the way out to the sunny state of Arizona.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
 Fellow content creator, let's go ahead and glide in front of Hayden High School.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,440
 We're going to land, make a nice little soft landing here.

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,120
 We're in Gila County, Arizona.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,520
 We're at Hayden High School, the home of the fight and Gila monsters.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,040
 I don't know if that's actually your mascot, but it should be.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
 That'd be dope.

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,720
 If one of their players bites you, you slowly die from their poisonous saliva.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 At Hayden High School, we actually have two ghosts at this school.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,440
 So the first thing we've got to do is we've got to suit up.

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,880
 We're getting ready to play in the big game.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
 You didn't know that.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,640
 We're actually going to play high school football right now.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,600
 Get on your gear and we are headed out to the field.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,240
 We're like throwing footballs back and forth to each other.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
 I don't know anything.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
 I barely know anything about football.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,560
 I shouldn't say I don't know anything.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,720
 I know what involves feet.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,760
 We've thrown footballs back and forth to referees.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,560
 Like, no, there's supposed to be one football in the field, you buffoons.

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,920
 What, you're not even one of the teams.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,520
 You're a bunch of adults running around in football uniforms.

46
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
 We tackle the referee.

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
 We're like, this is how we play.

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
 Beating up the referee.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,800
 After, after we all do time in the local jail for assault and battery, we show back up

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
 at the football field and now it's empty.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,960
 There's no fans in the stands.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,480
 Just a empty football field.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,160
 And that's where, this is where the story should have started because this is how the

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
 haunting is.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,760
 Apparently at Hayden High School, you show up late at night.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 It's so creepy to me.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,080
 This type of haunting is so creepy to me.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,960
 If you show up late at night at the Hayden High School football field, sometimes, not

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,280
 all the time, you'll see a football dude all alone on the field running.

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,720
 He has his little football.

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,680
 His cleats are digging into the soil.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,040
 We see him run and then gets to a certain point in the field and then he falls down.

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 Just disappears.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,000
 Now, apparently the back, this is what I find so, I wasn't able to find any news articles

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,200
 to back any of this stuff up.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 But what I find so fascinating about this is we have this ghostly phenomenon.

67
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,000
 The question is, how did this ghost appear?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 What is this?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,960
 Now, the supposedly the story, the supposedly the story that sets us up is at one time there

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,080
 was a football player on the football field during a game and he was tackled so viciously

71
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,840
 he got his neck snapped and he died shortly afterwards.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,440
 And what you're seeing is that event play out over and over.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,160
 Creepy, creepy haunting, right?

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,840
 One you're out, we talk about liminal space a lot nowadays, the back rooms and that whole

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
 thing.

76
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,520
 But there's also something just genuinely creepy about an empty arena, an empty field, because

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,720
 all that energy, all that psychic and physical energy constantly smashing against each other

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,800
 every weekend and you have these fans screaming on both sides and all of this energy is infusing

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,440
 the players on the field and getting everyone psyched up and this is what it was built for.

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:49,840
 These are ancient rituals and then when it's empty at night there is an eeriness to it.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,680
 It's the same thing as if you were going to a church all alone late at night or a library

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
 alone late at night.

83
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,320
 These places are constantly being infused with energy and there is a bizarre feeling when

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
 you're there by yourself.

85
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,120
 And this would be the perfect place for a haunting really because you have so much intense

86
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
 energy going on there.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,960
 I had a really good friend who was in, I had a bunch of friends in football in high school

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,920
 and I thought it was so interesting because the dynamic between myself and them, I always

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,360
 was an artist, I was always writing or performing in plays, things like that and for the artist

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,240
 my future was always ahead of me.

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,640
 I would always say well there's no great novelist who writes before the age of 30 so

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,880
 I don't really need to write now, I can just do whatever I want and that's how the artist

93
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,360
 looks, they look ahead.

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,960
 And even at the time I realized this I thought this was super interesting.

95
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,960
 I had a good friend of mine who was a really, really good football player, Nick.

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,440
 I remember when he played his last game of high school football and he cried afterwards.

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,920
 He cried because he knew, unlike me as an artist, well you know someday I'll do this,

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,120
 someday I'll write this novel, someday I'll write this screenplay.

99
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,760
 He knew that was the end of it now, forever, it was gone.

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,280
 This was the last time he would ever play competitive football.

101
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,720
 He knew he wasn't going to play in college, he knew he wasn't good enough to play in college,

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,920
 he knew he never would go pro.

103
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,120
 This would be the last time that it would be an organized football game in a football

104
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
 field.

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,800
 And it's interesting because people, physical fitness, physical sports are all, they're

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,840
 front loaded, you have to do all the stuff as early as possible.

107
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,640
 You can't be 30 years old and go, "I think I'll join the Bullshoi Ballet."

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,200
 I've never done it before, but I'm sure you know about six weeks of training.

109
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,840
 You can learn how to write a novel in six weeks.

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,600
 You can be 42 and write your first book.

111
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,080
 You can't be 42 and play your first game of competitive football.

112
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
 Like organized football, I'm not talking about your local football, touch football or whatever.

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,360
 It's fascinating to watch that difference between my dreams and his.

114
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,600
 That was the night he knew he would never play football again unless he was playing

115
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,560
 with the buddies, tossing the old pigskin back and forth.

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
 Very interesting.

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
 And I'd never seen that before.

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,600
 And then I go, "Well, that's, there's a different energy to that."

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,960
 And that's why being out there and watching this ghost try to make it to the end zone,

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 right?

121
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 But he can't.

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 He died.

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 And he didn't die on the field.

124
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,160
 And he died later, probably like in a hospital or something.

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,320
 I don't know, they just took him up to the stands and just had him sit there and die.

126
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,440
 So his ghost would return to that area.

127
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,280
 And as a paranormal investigator, we would classify this as a recording, right?

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 It's an image that had been recorded in time.

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,360
 His own soul may be somewhere else in the afterlife, but this psychic imprint left such a mark

130
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,600
 on the area that it's still there.

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,680
 Fascinating ghost story.

132
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
 Now it's time to go into the gym.

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,120
 This next haunting is also recorded to be at Hayden High School.

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,800
 And again, I looked for any sort of historical newspaper article on this, couldn't find anything.

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,080
 Now part of it could be, because it's urban legend, part of it could be that the hauntings

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
 exist.

137
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
 This is what's interesting about ghosts.

138
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
 Because we see this happen all the time.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,200
 The haunting itself exists, the backstory is made up.

140
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,560
 Or not necessarily made up, but misinterpreted or misremembered.

141
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,080
 It's very common you'll have a ghost at a place and a medium shows up and says, "Oh,

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,400
 well this farm hand died in this area, like the haunted Toys R Us in Sunnyvale or Sunnydale

143
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
 or wherever in California."

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,600
 There was like a farm, if I remember correctly, it was years and years and years ago.

145
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,040
 I remember the story totally terrifying me.

146
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,360
 I think it might have even been on Unsolved Mysteries.

147
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,960
 Like a farm hand died in this area and now they built a Toys R Us on top of it and his

148
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,840
 ghost is kind of walking around the Toys R Us and little bicycles are running down the

149
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,520
 aisles late at night.

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
 The haunting itself was real.

151
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,040
 Was that backstory real?

152
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
 Who knows.

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,920
 That was one medium who came out and said, "This is the impression I got."

154
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 But we don't know.

155
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 We don't know.

156
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
 And this could be a phantom of a ghost falling down a break in its neck or it could just

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,640
 be a ghost of a guy always trying to make that final play and he got stopped at that

158
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,200
 goal line and got knocked down or whatever and the other team won.

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,400
 And that was enough to build the psychic energy up.

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
 That's the interesting thing about ghosts.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,600
 The phenomenon is real with the backstories made up.

162
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,960
 But I'm just saying that again because I was trying to look for players getting killed

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
 in Hayden High School.

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,120
 I did not have the most relaxing weekend.

165
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,320
 This next story is along the same lines.

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,880
 Apparently in 1988 or 1989, around that time period, there was a beautiful high school

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,080
 senior.

168
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,600
 She was everyone's favorite because she was the most popular girl in school and she was

169
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,520
 on the cheerleading team.

170
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,160
 And she was just so beautiful that the world was just opening up before her.

171
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,040
 Some versions of the story, she had just gotten a job to be a professional cheerleader for

172
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
 the NFL.

173
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,040
 And other versions of the story say she wasn't going to be a cheerleader, but she was going

174
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
 to be a model.

175
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,820
 She was going to be an international superstar, a beauty on the runway, a beauty in the pages

176
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,400
 of magazines or just the most beautiful professional cheerleader.

177
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,080
 She was about to have all of her dreams come true.

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,720
 But before all of that could happen, she was at school and she was smoking weed in parking

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,440
 lot late at night.

180
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,400
 Now in 19 now and nowadays, you're like, okay, well, who cares?

181
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
 A model smoking weed?

182
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
 Who cares?

183
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 1988, 1989, obviously highly illegal.

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,360
 You're going to have marijuana.

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,000
 And the police roll up and they catch her and I assume catch other people as well smoke

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,520
 on this weed.

187
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,680
 And during the whole processing thing where the police are saying, well, we're going to

188
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 have to take you downtown and stuff like that.

189
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,680
 She realizes that she'll never achieve the dreams that the whole world had told her she

190
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
 would.

191
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
 Right?

192
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,000
 She was always, oh, you're so beautiful.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,880
 And the world will just kind of fall at your feet and she saw the world falling at her

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
 feet.

195
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,160
 But now 1988, getting caught with marijuana, it would definitely end her time on the cheerleading

196
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
 team in the high school.

197
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
 She would have been gone.

198
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,360
 And most likely would have ended her career as a professional cheerleader as well.

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
 She asked the police officers, hey, can I go back to my car and grab something?

200
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,840
 And police officers, you know, what could possibly go wrong?

201
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,680
 This young high school girl, what's she going to do?

202
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,800
 Get in the car, drive away from us?

203
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
 You know, she's a good girl.

204
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
 Yeah, she's smoking weed.

205
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 So we got to do our job.

206
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
 But yeah.

207
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,500
 So they let her walk over to where her car is parked.

208
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,140
 And then they hear a.

209
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,400
 She had a gun in her car because it is Arizona.

210
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,080
 I'm probably sure most people had gun in their cars, especially back then.

211
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,900
 She had a gun in her car and she shot herself in her own car in that parking lot.

212
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,360
 People say to this day, sometimes when you're in the gym, apparently this young lady, her

213
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,240
 ghost is now sighted in the gymnasium at Hayden High School.

214
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,720
 Some people say you can hear the sounds of her shoes against the court.

215
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 Right?

216
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,340
 You can hear the sound of someone practicing a cheerleading routine.

217
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,740
 You'll hear the sounds of her shoes.

218
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,700
 You'll hear a faint voice.

219
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,300
 Go Gila Monsters.

220
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,780
 And because throughout the area, right, there are stories of this haunted gymnasium.

221
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,100
 Once they had a softball competition at the Hayden High School and one of the visiting

222
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,180
 teams said, Hey, you know what?

223
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,940
 Let's stay the night in the gymnasium.

224
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,100
 We all heard that it was haunted.

225
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
 That would be really fun.

226
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,260
 We'll stay there all night long.

227
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,840
 Apparently this group of softball players were there and late in, they heard the stories

228
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,400
 about you can hear the faint sounds of cheerleading.

229
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,520
 You can hear the sound of the shoes squeaking on the floor.

230
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:09,120
 One night they're all there really late at night and off in the corner of the gymnasium,

231
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,920
 a full body apparition of a cheerleader appeared and she began doing a full cheerleading routine.

232
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,740
 Her eyes focused.

233
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,460
 Her muscles tight as she performs maneuver after maneuver after maneuver of this cheerleading

234
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,460
 routine.

235
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:35,320
 And the softball team just watched this phantom practice this over and over again until once

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,660
 the routine was done, the phantom vanished.

237
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,500
 What she couldn't achieve in life, you know, finishing her high school career, she is attempting

238
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,960
 to achieve in death.

239
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,460
 Again, this might just be a recording, right?

240
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:56,080
 This was when she was the most happy was doing these routines in the gymnasium practicing.

241
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,800
 It could just be an after image of this young woman who did die.

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,840
 It could also just be a psychic residue of a cheerleader doing this routine over and

243
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,880
 over again, trying to nail it.

244
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,160
 And the story made up about the suicide was made up, you know, it could have been attached

245
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
 to it.

246
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,120
 But I got one more ghost story for you.

247
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,700
 If you're tired of hearing about dead teenagers, this one is not an after image.

248
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,860
 This ghost story has far more sinister implications for what the afterlife may hold.

249
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,300
 We're going to leave Hayden High School.

250
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,780
 We're headed to Mesa, Arizona, and we're going to stop by Powell Junior High School.

251
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,460
 There's a lot of stories when you look up.

252
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,540
 This is one of the so Powell Junior High doesn't exist anymore.

253
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,200
 They've turned it into like a community center.

254
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,220
 But when Powell Junior High did exist, it had a lot of stories about the locker rooms

255
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,720
 being haunted.

256
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,760
 But we're going to look at something outside the school grounds, really right outside the

257
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,080
 school grounds.

258
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,880
 Powell Junior High was built in 1971.

259
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,640
 And apparently, according to the Shadowlands.net, a young girl one day was taking swimming lessons

260
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,720
 at Powell Junior High.

261
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,400
 And after her swim practice, she was headed home.

262
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,260
 So she leaves the building and she begins crossing the street.

263
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,860
 And right now we're on 8th Street in extension.

264
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,500
 If you want to experiment with this, you can though.

265
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,540
 Let me finish the story before you get all your buddies on the car.

266
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,420
 This young girl is leaving Powell Junior High to walk home.

267
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,060
 And as she is crossing the street, a car slams into her and kills her instantly.

268
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,580
 She dies on the street right there.

269
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,060
 Apparently, every bone broken in her body.

270
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,200
 That's how savage this car impacted this little girl.

271
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:52,480
 And people say that to this day, you can sometimes see the image of this girl trying

272
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,280
 to cross the street.

273
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,720
 But as this girl gets closer to the middle of the street, she starts to disappear.

274
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,280
 She starts to fade away.

275
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,040
 As she's getting to the location of where the car hit her, she's translucent.

276
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,360
 She's beginning to just disappear.

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,660
 But you can hear her cry out in pain, in agony and sadness.

278
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:25,180
 You can hear her voice scream out, "I just want to go home."

279
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
 Apparition disappears.

280
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,620
 See, I don't think that's a recording.

281
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,780
 I don't think that is an after image.

282
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,160
 I think that is the spirit of this little girl trying to...

283
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,200
 Are there remaining two listeners?

284
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,000
 My remaining two listeners are like, "Oh, this is super depressing."

285
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,800
 I think this little girl is trying to get home.

286
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,480
 And she can't get past the point where she died.

287
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,120
 And her saying that, "I just want to go home," is...

288
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,760
 It is a...

289
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,080
 She's saying that now.

290
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,500
 She sees home as this impossibly far destination.

291
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,660
 She's been trying to cross the street now for decades.

292
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,900
 Just want to go home.

293
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
 And it's interesting.

294
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,740
 This is the type of ghost that you, I believe you probably could interact with.

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,180
 I think that is her consciousness in some way stuck in that loop.

296
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
 But how you...

297
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
 I think this would be...

298
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,500
 People say, "Try to get the spirits to cross over."

299
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
 That seems like this would be a prime candidate for that thing.

300
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,680
 It is in the middle of traffic.

301
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,840
 I don't recommend you guys sitting there trying to hold a seance as cars are flying by you.

302
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
 You might just add to the ghost population.

303
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,480
 What's interesting about this story and again, one of the things I like to do is to do more

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,040
 reporting than just reading the ghost information.

305
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,920
 On Shadowlands.net, they do get some key details wrong.

306
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,240
 They said the school was built in the 1950s.

307
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,600
 That's not true.

308
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,340
 And they said this story took place on First Street.

309
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,780
 But that's not true either.

310
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
 The school is not in that location.

311
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,540
 So just throwing that out there, because I know a lot of you guys like to go research

312
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,580
 this stuff as well.

313
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,980
 I had to kind of piece together the date that the school is actually open.

314
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,420
 But as far as forgetting those factual issues, forgetting those factual problems with the

315
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,620
 story, this would be a prime candidate to try to contact this ghost and try to get this

316
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,460
 spirit to move on.

317
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,880
 And to me, this is scary.

318
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,040
 Like the cheerleader doing the routine.

319
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
 That's fascinating.

320
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,520
 It could just be an after image of recording something with a football player.

321
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,640
 I don't think the football player is thinking, well, if I can just get to the end zone, then

322
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 I'll be fine.

323
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,760
 Then my ghost will go on.

324
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,600
 I think it might just be an after image.

325
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,640
 But I think this little girl is stuck here.

326
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,120
 She's trying to get home.

327
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,720
 But in this case, she's trying to get, she needs to stop thinking about trying to get

328
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,660
 home and trying to get into the afterlife, trying to reach paradise.

329
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:00,860
 But she's still finding herself stuck in that earthly prison, walking across the street

330
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,500
 that she will never fully cross.

331
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,980
 You know, I don't have time to do the Duck Lake segment.

332
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,420
 That one, it takes a long time.

333
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,580
 It's a really, really interesting one.

334
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,820
 I've been saving it for a while.

335
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,140
 I'm not going to have time to do that one this session.

336
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
 But let's go ahead.

337
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
 Fellow content creator.

338
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,660
 Let's go ahead and toss you this.

339
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,200
 Here are the keys for the carbonar copter.

340
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,240
 We are leaving behind Arizona.

341
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,840
 We'll be back later this week because I got some more cool.

342
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,960
 The next one is when ghosts go weird.

343
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,640
 Some really bizarre hauntings.

344
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 I don't even know if you could call it that.

345
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,960
 Just some weird, weirdness going on in Arizona.

346
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
 Let's all hop in the carbonar copter.

347
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,880
 We are leaving behind Arizona.

348
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:49,600
 We're headed all the way out to a bird nest.

349
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,740
 This story was sent to me by Patreon supporter Zachary McCree.

350
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,540
 So thank you so much for sending this over.

351
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,380
 Quite a bizarre story.

352
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,500
 Technically, it's a fable, but it has real world implications.

353
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,660
 This was written by a fellow named Nick Bostrom.

354
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,380
 Some of you guys will recognize that name so you'll know where it's going.

355
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,820
 But for the rest of you dudes, let's go ahead and we are sitting in the Sparrow's Nest.

356
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,180
 We're not human-sized or tiny little sparrow-sized people.

357
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,480
 Because we're here for a meeting.

358
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
 The sparrows are having a meeting.

359
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,280
 What happens is, one day these sparrows are sitting there and they realize it's nest building

360
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
 season.

361
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
 This nest they're in, it's kind of junky looking.

362
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
 It's like half complete.

363
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,480
 There's just like a little bit of twigs and some string.

364
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,760
 And a couple of sparrows are falling out during this meeting.

365
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,600
 They're like, "Listen, we really got to finish this nest."

366
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,760
 However, it sucks.

367
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,280
 Nest building is really hard.

368
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,960
 To do all this manual labor sucks.

369
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,120
 What if, one of the sparrows says.

370
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,380
 What if we could have an owl build our nest?

371
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,820
 The sparrows are like, "What are you talking about dude?

372
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,380
 Owls would like totally eat us."

373
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,340
 A normal owl, like a big giant owl would probably grab us right out of the nest, bite our heads

375
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,260
 off one by one.

376
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,740
 But what if we could raise an owl?

377
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,020
 What if we could find an owl egg and when the owl pops out, we're all standing around

378
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,160
 and he thinks that we're the parents.

379
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,080
 And we raise this owl to do our bidding.

380
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,700
 Everyone's like, "That does sound like a great idea."

381
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,160
 You could have this big owl building all of our nests.

382
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,480
 And then another sparrow goes, "Yeah, not only that can we have him build our nest, he'll

383
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
 protect us."

384
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,720
 When a neighborhood cat is trying to eat one of us, our pet owl will scare the cat away.

385
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,860
 So it won't just help us do this manual labor, it'll actually be a security force.

386
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,460
 All the sparrows are like, "This is a great idea.

387
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,600
 How come we never thought about this before?"

388
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,900
 If we had an owl to do our bidding, we wouldn't have to do much work at all.

389
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,020
 We would just train the owl to do everything we don't want to do.

390
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,300
 And there you go.

391
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,620
 And not only the stuff we don't want to do, but the stuff we can do, like defending it

392
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,540
 from local pests, like cats, skunks, I don't know, skunks eat sparrows.

393
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,700
 I don't know much about sparrows.

394
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,680
 But anyways, every problem that we face nowadays can be solved with an owl.

395
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,120
 An owl we trained to serve us.

396
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,720
 And at that point, there's a little sparrow sitting on the dark side of the nest.

397
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,560
 It's all in the shade underneath the tree.

398
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,840
 It's all dramatic.

399
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,120
 There's a little sparrow sitting there and he kind of walks out of the shadows and everyone's

400
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
 like, "Ugh."

401
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,980
 He kind of walks out of the shadows and they're like, "Oop.

402
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,480
 Here comes good old skronk finkle.

403
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,540
 He's going to rain on our parade," the sparrows think.

404
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
 And they're right.

405
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
 They're right.

406
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,060
 Skronk finkle is going to rain on their parade.

407
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,300
 He comes out of the shadows and he has a little patch over one eye.

408
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,540
 He's definitely seen some stuff.

409
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,100
 He's been in it, right?

410
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,300
 That he's been in it.

411
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,460
 That skunk is trying to eat him one day.

412
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
 Took an eye out.

413
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:11,620
 And skronk finkle walks out and he goes, "Guys, what you are saying is beyond dumb.

414
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,720
 You want to get an owl egg and you want to raise it as one of our own and make it do

415
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,680
 all the stuff we don't want to do."

416
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
 And they go, "Yeah.

417
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
 Why is that dumb?"

418
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,120
 And skronk finkle goes, "Just by show of feathers.

419
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:33,560
 Can anyone just raise a wing if they know anything about raising an owl?"

420
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,720
 Little sparrows kind of look at each other and skronk finkle goes, "That's the right

421
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
 thought.

422
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,900
 Let us know anything about how to raise an owl.

423
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,700
 How to train an owl.

424
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
 We don't know anything.

425
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,300
 And yet you're talking about grabbing an owl egg, bringing it here, and when it hatches,

426
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,860
 you are going to take control of it."

427
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
 Doesn't make any sense.

428
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,140
 And that's when the sparrows get upset and they say, "Listen, it's going to be hard enough

429
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,260
 to have Phase 1 of this plant take place.

430
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,720
 Phase 1, find an owl egg that's not currently being guarded by a mama owl and snatch it

431
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
 out of the nest.

432
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,840
 That's the hardest part of the plan."

433
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,040
 Now sure, raising the owl might be hard, but why are we even thinking about that if we

434
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,120
 don't even have the owl egg first?

435
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,960
 We're going to bring an owl egg and we'll raise it.

436
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
 We'll figure out the second part.

437
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 Skronk finkle goes, "Don't.

438
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
 Please don't do this.

439
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,280
 You can't bring an owl here."

440
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,660
 And yet the majority has spoken and the sparrows fly off in all directions, looking for an

441
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,540
 owl egg, each of them having the little image in their head of how perfect life in the nest

442
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,500
 will be with this giant owl to build for them and to protect them and to care for them.

443
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,100
 And Skronk finkle and a few other sparrows stay behind in the nest.

444
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,660
 And they go, "Well, if they are dead set on finding an owl egg, we better learn how to

445
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,240
 raise an owl.

446
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,700
 We got to have this part.

447
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,280
 Phase two is very important and honestly it's probably more important than phase one."

448
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,560
 And the sparrows who are left go about trying to figure out a way to raise an owl.

449
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,400
 But what they figure out very quickly is they know nothing about raising owls.

450
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,480
 They really don't know anything about owls to begin with.

451
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,320
 It's very hard to practice raising an owl if you don't have an owl to work with.

452
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,180
 And as they're trying to figure out all of these things that could possibly go wrong with

453
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,580
 an owl and all of these things that they could possibly use to train an owl while they're

454
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:45,740
 figuring this out, every so often Skronk finkle looks up and scans the sky because he knows

455
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:55,060
 at any moment one of his fellow sparrows is going to come flying over the horizon carrying

456
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,760
 an owl egg.

457
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:09,080
 And they have until that very moment to figure out how to control an owl.

458
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
 Nick Bostrom wrote that.

459
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
 It's called "The Unfinished Fable of the Sparrow."

460
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:22,760
 And Nick Bostrom is a famous Swedish philosopher and a famed warrior about artificial intelligence

461
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,960
 taking over the planet.

462
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,500
 And he wrote this book called, it came out back in 2015 I believe, called "Super Intelligence

463
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,340
 - Paths, Dangers, Strategies."

464
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,700
 And he uses the unfinished fable of the owl, he uses that story to basically say this is

465
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,920
 what AI is.

466
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,460
 That we are building a monster within our nest, the nest being the planet Earth.

467
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,140
 And we know nothing about how these things are going to work in the real world.

468
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
 Zero.

469
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,120
 We can't even practice on them.

470
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,480
 We can't even figure out a way to contain superintelligence.

471
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,840
 He's actually the guy who coined the term superintelligence.

472
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,600
 And superintelligence you don't have to have like a galactic level consciousness.

473
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,280
 Superintelligence is simply smarter than a human.

474
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 He goes once these things become smarter than a human it's game over.

475
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,800
 It doesn't have to be exponentially smarter than a human, it just has to be a little bit

476
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,640
 smarter than a human and we're done.

477
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,860
 We're building an owl and we have no idea how to raise it.

478
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,060
 It's so fascinating.

479
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,220
 Zachary McCree sent this over to me and I was like that is so bizarre because there

480
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,260
 is, how do you practice controlling an AI if we don't even know how an AI thinks?

481
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,700
 And he goes listen, it could be something that you set up a very basic thing for an

482
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,260
 AI to do.

483
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,380
 Solve a math problem that humans believe is unsolvable.

484
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,940
 And it might be unsolvable.

485
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,360
 When you tell this AI, can you give us the answer to this problem?

486
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,880
 And the AI will have its main goal, but just like humans will have sub goals, right?

487
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,800
 We may say solve this math problem.

488
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,440
 The AI will have the main goal and then have a sub goal going well if I need to solve this

489
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,600
 math problem and I can't solve it using the state that I'm in right now, I'm going to

490
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,760
 turn the entire planet into a computer.

491
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,280
 And he goes once you can't predict it.

492
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,980
 He goes you cannot predict what the AI will do.

493
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,780
 And once it is smarter than a person, it's too late.

494
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,700
 It will do things we never thought of because it's smarter than us.

495
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:29,820
 Just like you can outwit a cat or a lobster, we would be the lobster.

496
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,300
 We wouldn't even be able to comprehend, be like, huh, I wonder why he did that?

497
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,140
 Because our body is being digitized.

498
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
 We wouldn't even be able to predict the why.

499
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,740
 We wouldn't even know what it was, what it was doing, let alone the why.

500
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,120
 But he, him, it's funny because he posted this, he came out with this book and I remember

501
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,920
 reading about this at the time, this was when Elon Musk was saying I'm more afraid of artificial

502
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,520
 intelligence than I am of nuclear weapons.

503
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,320
 And there was a lot of people who Bill Gates was also on that boat.

504
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,840
 He goes yeah, I'm more afraid of AI taking over than nuclear weapons being deployed.

505
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,600
 We've had nuclear weapons around for what, 50, 60, 70 years at this point and they've

506
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,440
 been used in war twice.

507
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,180
 It was really in just in the one war.

508
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,820
 At this point we're fairly responsible with our nuclear weapons as a civilization.

509
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,620
 The AI is something far more dangerous than people being like, you know what, I don't

510
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,180
 want to press this button, even though I'm getting orders from my leader, I don't think

511
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,500
 it's, you have so many safeguards with humans making moral decisions about whether or not

512
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,100
 to deploy nuclear bombs.

513
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,540
 And really at this point they're kind of passe.

514
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,460
 We have non-nuclear bombs that can still do a massive amount of damage and they don't

515
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,280
 have the cultural or the moral outrage as if you dropped a nuke.

516
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,680
 But with the AI you don't have any of those safety protocols because we don't know what

517
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,120
 the safety protocols would be, we don't know what we would need.

518
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,040
 There's no instruction manual on how to deal with an AI because there's never been an AI.

519
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,680
 I find that absolutely fascinating.

520
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,400
 I had never thought about that before.

521
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,900
 We did an episode a long time ago.

522
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
 I'll see if I can remember the title of it.

523
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,460
 I'll put in the show notes about putting an AI in a box and how you can never truly keep

524
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,540
 it in the box.

525
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,380
 And that was when we were talking about building something we knew was dangerous.

526
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,580
 This is, we're going to accidentally build something that's super dangerous.

527
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,060
 And they put together like Nick Bostrom and a bunch of other eggheads put together this

528
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:33,860
 thing like the 23 things that need to be set in place, the 23 rules for artificial intelligence.

529
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:39,040
 But really the main thing they were saying is that if any government or any corporation

530
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:46,880
 ever invents like they're on the cusp of getting true AI, they need to stop immediately.

531
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,160
 Nick Bostrom says you need to stop immediately.

532
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,680
 And then all of the governments of the world sit down and figure out how to raise an owl.

533
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,640
 And he goes, it may come to the point that if they can't figure it out, we need to physically

534
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,000
 destroy the equipment.

535
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,540
 Now this is not when the, once the AI is online, that is too late.

536
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,620
 He's saying if you think that you're actually super close to developing this, stop.

537
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
 And we will think about it.

538
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:21,300
 And if we can't come up with a foolproof way of raising this owl, we destroy it.

539
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,420
 We do not even turn it back on.

540
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,260
 That is the threat level that's going on here.

541
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,620
 I thought it was fascinating too because as I was reading this, I go, this applies not

542
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,400
 just to AI, but things, everything, really.

543
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,400
 Every week I go, I drop $5 on the lottery.

544
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,600
 I don't know anything about wealth management.

545
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,920
 I've never had an accountant.

546
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,440
 I barely pay my taxes, right?

547
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,120
 And yet if I won $50 million in the lottery, I go, oh, I would do this.

548
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
 I would do that.

549
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,520
 I would do this.

550
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,540
 But I couldn't even prepare for the idea of having $50 million in my account.

551
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,260
 I'm trying to get that owl leg without knowing how to raise an owl.

552
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,260
 But you could Jason, why would you go and learn about wealth management?

553
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,980
 Why would you go and learn about taxes and stuff like that and paying them on time and

554
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,300
 not having the IRS harass you all the time?

555
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,180
 If you don't already have the money, why would you be planning on how to have the money?

556
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,320
 I mean, technically, I probably should take a wealth management class.

557
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
 Probably everyone should know how to handle their money.

558
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,600
 But it's that same thing.

559
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,040
 I understand why the Sparrows wanted the owl egg first.

560
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,680
 Winning the lottery is the hard part.

561
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:45,360
 But if all of a sudden $50 million dropped into my lab, it would be very, very difficult

562
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,840
 for me to not blow it all because I don't know anything about wealth management.

563
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,300
 I tell myself I put some in savings and I put this and I know me.

564
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,660
 I would become a super paranoid that people are going to steal from me.

565
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,980
 So I'd be like, I don't want accounts.

566
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,820
 I don't want any of these people have access to my accounts.

567
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,420
 I just want my money to sit in a bank and I just live off of it.

568
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,820
 That's what I would do.

569
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,140
 But I don't know.

570
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,420
 Is that what you do when you win the lottery?

571
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,660
 And then I also think about the paranormal angle, right?

572
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,480
 So many people are always constantly trying to summon demons, this Faustian pact.

573
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:31,240
 It's always about looking for one simple goal, one simple thing, and everything spins out

574
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
 of control.

575
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
 Literally the genie is out of the bottle type of thing.

576
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,000
 So we look at this as an AI thing, but throughout history, people have constantly tried to

577
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,600
 snatch the owl egg and not know how to raise an owl.

578
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,440
 And whether that be something as simple as winning the lottery.

579
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,140
 Now you have this owl egg, you have all of this wealth.

580
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,740
 You don't know how to handle it.

581
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,580
 You don't know how to deal with it.

582
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,620
 Or you're trying to summon a succubus, which we see all the time.

583
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,100
 It might be one of the most common things people use magic for is trying to summon a

584
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,460
 lover, demonic, or use law of attraction to suck someone into your life.

585
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,860
 But once they're there, then what?

586
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,580
 You've never had a girlfriend before, ever had a girlfriend before, and now you use the

587
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,640
 dark arts to seduce a woman.

588
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 Now she's in your life.

589
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,720
 Now what?

590
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,200
 You have that owl egg, but you know nothing about how to raise an owl.

591
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
 You know nothing about how to have a healthy relationship.

592
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,200
 And here is this woman that you've basically demonically influenced to show up.

593
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
 It's so fascinating.

594
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,680
 It literally is, "Be careful what you wish for."

595
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,800
 But that always was kind of the thing like, "Be careful what you wish for because you

596
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,340
 may be disappointed when you get it."

597
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,180
 Or, "Be careful what you wish for because it might be more than you can handle."

598
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,540
 This one is, "Be careful what you wish for.

599
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:01,300
 It will destroy the planet Earth."

600
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,660
 Scientists, and I understand why they do it, right?

601
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
 They're scientists.

602
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,980
 They want to discover things, but they want that AI so much they want that owl egg in their

603
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,420
 possession that they'll say, "We'll figure out the rest later."

604
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,540
 I mean, this AI research has been going on for decades.

605
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,640
 This guy wrote this book in 2015, and that's when people go, "Oh, this might actually be

606
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,520
 a problem."

607
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,120
 So fascinating.

608
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,480
 We are constantly chasing the owl egg, and we say, "We'll figure out phase two next.

609
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,080
 It's going to be hard enough to get the owl egg.

610
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,360
 We'll figure out how to raise it after we have it."

611
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,640
 But once you have that owl egg, and once that starts to hatch, you better learn real quickly

612
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,140
 how to deal with it.

613
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,820
 Because it's not just going to consume you, it's going to consume everything around you.

614
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,280
 If we're talking about using black magic to seduce people, it's going to consume you,

615
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,980
 it's going to consume them.

616
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,460
 It may affect your family.

617
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,700
 If you're talking about winning the lottery, it's going to consume you, it's going to consume

618
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:10,500
 your friends, your enemies will line up to take you down.

619
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,040
 But if it's in the case of an AI, it's going to consume the scientists who develop it,

620
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,280
 it's going to consume those who are trying to shut it down, and eventually it will consume

621
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,680
 the entire planet, and it won't care.

622
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,520
 Because to this AI, it is the mighty owl.

623
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:38,160
 And the human race is just a bunch of weak sparrows taking up space in its nest.
