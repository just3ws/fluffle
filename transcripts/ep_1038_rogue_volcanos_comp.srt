1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
 At what point does good intentions turn you into a super villain?

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,840
 And then we travel to Ohio to kick off close encounters of a canine kind week.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,800
 We're going to look at three stories of what happens when dogs meet aliens.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,480
 In today's story, two hunting hounds are on the prowl looking for a skunk or fox, something

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,760
 like that, something they can kill with their teeth, probably not a skunk.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,280
 Another thing about it that would be the worst thing to hunt.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
 Honey, look at what I brought home dinner.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,120
 With these two hunting hounds are on the prowl looking for its prey.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,360
 Instead these two dogs end up in the presence of a grey alien.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:01:00,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,640
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,320
 I hope you guys are ready for close encounters of a canine kind week.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,360
 I only have three stories, I'm not going to force five, but there are three really cool

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,240
 stories of what happens when man's best friend meets invaders from another world.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,400
 We'll go ahead and get that started in just a second.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,440
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,720
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for BurntToastGhost.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,240
 Woohoo, yeah, walk on in, yeah, he's walking on in with a bunch of hound dogs, he's ready

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
 to fight aliens.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,520
 BurntToastGhost, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,960
 If you guys can't support this show, totally fine, I get it, just helps spread the word

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,880
 That really does help out a lot.

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,120
 And if you guys do support this show, if you guys are Patreon supporters, don't forget

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,960
 we have a Patreon Discord.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,240
 And we do live episodes every Sunday and BurntToastGhost is one of those guys who tries to make sure

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
 that he swings by all the time.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
 So, it's really, really a lot of fun.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
 It's a lot of fun.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,920
 BurntToastGhost, we're going to go ahead and start off by tossing you the keys to the

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,840
 Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,920
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command and drive us all the way out to a volcano.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:26,760
 We're walking around the edge of this volcano, lava spewing everywhere.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,400
 It's all erupted and stuff.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,520
 And we got on our heat resistance suit, you're not just wearing regular clothes as you listen

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,600
 to this podcast, you're not geared up, sorry bro.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,520
 Lot lava spewing everywhere and those of us who wore heat resistance suits were like jumping

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
 around in it.

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,280
 I think it's just that they're heat resistant.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
 I don't think they're lava proof.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,600
 But anyways, we're hanging out at the edge of this volcano or feet are dangling over

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
 the rim.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:59,960
 And the reason why we're here is volcanoes are sometimes good.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,760
 That was the name of my thesis in college.

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
 Volcanoes are sometimes good.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,560
 Because yes, while they suck because they're like shooting lava everywhere and people have

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,600
 to run from them like boulders are falling on top of people.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,360
 Sometimes if the world is, okay I can strap in because this is a science based story.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
 This is a good old Jason.

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,560
 Jason read a single article.

53
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
 That's not fair.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
 I did read multiple articles but Jason's going to try to explain something that world class

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,840
 scientists struggle to put into words.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,480
 Anyways, lava sometimes bad because it melts people.

57
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,560
 If it's like chasing after you and you have a cramp in your leg you're like, "I'm dead."

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,480
 But while we mourn your sacrifice to the lava gods, sometimes lava is good or volcanoes

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,000
 are good because it can reduce the temperature of the planet.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,840
 Because as it's like spilling lava everywhere, there's also a bunch of dust coming.

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,400
 How does the dust shoot out of it now?

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
 Oh, clouds.

63
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,760
 So the clouds billow out.

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
 It's not actual dust I don't think.

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,480
 Google search can easily answer this for me.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,640
 But anyway, clouds are shooting out of the volcano.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,240
 Hot lava is terrorizing the people below.

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:21,400
 But then because the clouds will cover the sky, the sunbeams can't get in.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,880
 So it makes things get cooler.

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,840
 So as you're slowly boiling to death as you're like, "Oh man, why did I pick today to eat

71
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,720
 this watermelon on the edge of a volcano?"

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,760
 And you're boiling, you're blowing up, melting from the inside, pick your poison.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
 You can enjoy.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,000
 You're like, "Oh, this sure is a nice breeze.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,600
 This sure is a nice cool breeze on the last remaining two inches of my skin."

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,400
 Because it can actually cool the planet.

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:57,520
 But sometimes volcanoes are still bad because as the planet cools, crops, like you're growing,

78
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,840
 you got a bunch of wheat, and you're like, "Good old sunlight.

79
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
 Thanks for doing your part.

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,400
 Thanks for doing your part on this farm, giving these plants all the nutrients they need."

81
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,720
 And then all of a sudden, a giant volcanic cloud starts floating around and it's like,

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
 "Ha ha ha ha ha."

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,560
 And it's like standing, it's standing just over your crops.

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,040
 It's like all your neighbors, their wheat continues to grow and the volcano is like,

85
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,760
 "I hate you."

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,600
 And then if it's too cold, crops can't grow and people have to buy jackets because they're

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,920
 getting a little chilly too.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,480
 But sometimes volcanoes can still be good because despite the fact that everything's

89
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:40,600
 getting cooler and you're only your crops are dying, it can reduce the temperature overall.

90
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,920
 And people are concerned about global warming.

91
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,280
 They don't really use that term anymore.

92
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,680
 But global warming, they're concerned about climate change.

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,880
 So volcanoes can be good and bad.

94
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
 It's all well and good.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
 Or bad.

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
 It's all well and good or bad.

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
 But what happens?

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,000
 This is actually a real story that's going on and people are incredibly concerned about

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,280
 this because listen, we can't tell when a volcano is going to go off and it can cause

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,440
 massive disruptions to the environment.

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
 We know that.

102
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:23,880
 But what if somebody decided to start setting off volcanoes on purpose but to solve global

103
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,760
 warming?

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,760
 What if there was a group of people, a dedicated organization that exists today that decides

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,200
 we are going to set off multiple volcanoes all around the world and it will actually,

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,360
 in the long run, it will help the world because the temperature will drop and we will end

107
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,840
 the climate crisis.

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,520
 Generally, we would call that group, we call that group Cobra, right?

109
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,760
 That sounds like a terrorist act from a 1980s cartoon.

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,800
 But there is actually a group called Make Sunsets.

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
 And this is a real group.

112
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,040
 Now while they aren't as cool as actually like I would have been like I have 10 nuclear

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,640
 bombs built underneath all of these volcanoes.

114
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,440
 I lost thousands of men planting them.

115
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,600
 They all melted.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,400
 But the bombs didn't melt and now world leaders bow to me and climate change.

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,920
 That's what I'm really doing it for.

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,240
 It's not to make people bow to me.

119
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
 It's climate change.

120
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,720
 I'm fighting it.

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 They're not that cool.

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,040
 They're not actually blowing up a volcano.

123
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
 What would happen if you blew up a volcano actually?

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 That's kind of interesting.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
 Jamie, find that out.

126
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,560
 Find that out and get back to me.

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,360
 They are creating artificial volcanoes.

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,040
 It's not much of an air baking powder or baking soda, whatever it is.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,160
 It's not that.

130
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,520
 They have these weather balloons.

131
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,920
 It's the real reason why Biden's been shooting all that stuff down.

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,320
 What they're doing is they're using weather balloons that will release.

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 This is totally true.

134
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,800
 They have these weather balloons.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
 I don't know why I keep saying that.

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,600
 I talk about ghosts all the time and I just assume that stuff's true.

137
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,200
 They have these weather balloons that are going to release sulfur into the air.

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,640
 This mimics the good part of the volcano.

139
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,040
 It's the less cool part of the volcano to be honest.

140
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 It's kind of lame.

141
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
 But the sulfur in the air, they're releasing it.

142
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,400
 So it mimics the effect, the cooling effect of the volcano.

143
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,480
 You know what all the smoke and dust is of there.

144
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,040
 It creates a cloud of particles that reflects the sun rays away from the planet.

145
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,200
 And here's the thing.

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,080
 They've already done this once.

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 This is a new article.

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,560
 I just read this article written by Emma Gatton.

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,720
 This article came out about two weeks ago where they were talking about it and they're

150
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,840
 like, "We're doing this because we need to save the world.

151
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
 We need to stop the climate problem.

152
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,640
 We need to cool the earth down because it's steadily getting hotter."

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,680
 Think about all those chunks of ice that are breaking off and stuff like that.

154
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,240
 That's what we're trying to stop is what this...

155
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
 You know what's so funny?

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,480
 Their group is called Make Sunsets.

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,120
 And that's not as cool as Cobra or Skeletor or the Decepticons, right?

158
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:26,000
 But it's actually worse because I think in real life the creepies, the creepos out there,

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
 allegedly, allegedly, I don't know how creepy these people are.

160
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,400
 I don't know if they have a bunch of mutant henchmen or stuff like that, but you would

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,560
 name your group like Rise or you would call it like the Helping Hand Project.

162
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,360
 And you would basically be like creating mind-controlled monkeys to take over countries.

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,480
 You wouldn't name a group Cobra.

164
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,240
 As cool as that is, you wouldn't because everyone would go, "Well, I don't want you operating

165
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
 in my country.

166
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,960
 I'm not going to donate money to your 501(c)(3) non-profit.

167
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,160
 You're called Cobra."

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,840
 So they're called Make Sunsets, which is spooky.

169
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
 Spooky.

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
 So anyways, and you go, "Jason, you're just being an alarmist.

171
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
 All these people are doing it.

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,000
 All of a sudden you remember of the group, all my Patreon donators, they just leave.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,920
 So like he's discovered our plan."

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,120
 This has gotten so bad that you can go back, because this is not a new plan.

175
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,880
 People have been talking about this for years, but you can also see articles going back years

176
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,120
 where other scientists, most scientists are saying, "This is a terribly bad idea."

177
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,880
 Like yes, the world's getting hotter.

178
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,320
 And yes, if you release sulfur into the air, it will do what you're saying it to do.

179
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,400
 But the scientific community is totally against this.

180
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,520
 And it was interesting, Sir David Attenborough, you know, the narrator guy.

181
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:58,400
 He was talking about this, I think, back in like 2012, and he said, "He called this fascist.

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,520
 He called this practice fascist."

183
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,920
 He had this interesting quote.

184
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,520
 He said, "Geoengineering is a very difficult thing, because what that means is that you

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,480
 allow one nation or one small group within that nation to determine what's going to happen

186
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,760
 to the whole globe."

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,000
 And he says, you know, that's really, it's fascist to do that.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,680
 You have other scientists, other leading scientists saying, "Everyone agrees that this

189
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,040
 would work as far as like a scientific experiment, a scientific principle."

190
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,000
 But they go, "Listen, you'd have to do it all over the globe at the same time.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,560
 If you just change, if you just release this sulfur into the northern hemisphere, it's

192
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,240
 going to destroy the southern hemisphere."

193
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 They go, "Monsun seasons would become completely unpredictable.

194
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,160
 We wouldn't be able to," not like they're doing a good job of predicting the weather

195
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,000
 now, but we want to be able to predict it even less, and we want to know when to prepare.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It would throw everything off.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,960
 So if you're going to do this, you have to do this everywhere.

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,080
 The problem is, is make sunsets has done this, well, as the time of this recording, they've

199
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
 done it once.

200
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,760
 They originally planned to do it from Mexico, and they released this balloon in December,

201
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,840
 December 2022.

202
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,680
 This is the first time people are announcing that they're doing this.

203
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 It'll be interesting.

204
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,880
 I wonder if anyone's tried it before.

205
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,800
 They're releasing two kilograms of sulfur into the air.

206
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,160
 They launched it from Mexico, the first one.

207
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,200
 The Mexican government goes, "You can't do that here.

208
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,720
 You can't do that here."

209
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,680
 So this is so insane.

210
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,320
 They can't do it in Mexico.

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,040
 The government said, "Get out of here.

212
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
 We don't know what."

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,560
 I mean, we know what you're trying to do, and that's nice, I guess, but this is rogue

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,880
 science.

215
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,160
 So the government in Mexico kicked them out, so now they're in California.

216
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,880
 In California governments, like, "Sure, go ahead, throw up that sulfur, guys," and they're

217
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,040
 planning on launching another balloon full of this.

218
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,320
 And they're like, "We have..."

219
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
 The thing is, when you look at these articles, when you...

220
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,080
 They're all being in the show notes, but when you look at these articles, you have this

221
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
 divide.

222
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,280
 Basically, you have everyone in the scientific community.

223
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
 Well, not everyone.

224
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,320
 A biologist probably doesn't know anything about this, or a social scientist is like,

225
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,960
 "What sulfur?"

226
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,360
 But in the climate scientists, they're like, "Don't do this.

227
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
 This is a terrible idea.

228
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,080
 If you're going to do it, you have to do it everywhere at once, and you can't have one

229
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,160
 person deciding to do it."

230
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,600
 But on the other hand, you have...

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,960
 Make sunsets say, "We can't wait for global consensus.

232
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
 We can't wait.

233
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,200
 Eventually, it's going to be irreversible.

234
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,400
 The damage to the climate is going to be irreversible.

235
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,920
 If we wait, it'll be too late.

236
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,560
 So we are going to take action because of the rest of the world sitting around twiddling

237
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,120
 their thumbs."

238
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,060
 So they're launching these balloons.

239
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,160
 They're being funded.

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,600
 People are donating money to this.

241
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,440
 And they're changing, or at this point attempting to change the environment.

242
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
 One balloon at a time.

243
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,040
 That would be so hilarious.

244
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,600
 That's the reason why all these balloons are getting shot down.

245
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
 It's not UFOs.

246
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
 It's make sunsets.

247
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
 And they're like, "Drats!

248
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
 My balloons!

249
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,760
 They keep getting destroyed!"

250
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,400
 And then there's like a sexy scientist in a black leather medical coat, and she's like,

251
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,440
 "Oh, yes, but maybe.

252
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 Just maybe.

253
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,880
 Well, the plan is just to release more balloons, right?

254
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,540
 Yes, we'll release balloons until they run out of missiles!"

255
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,460
 And that's what they're going to do.

256
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,340
 I actually didn't actually say that.

257
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
 It wasn't a direct quote.

258
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,980
 We're going to release balloons until they run out of missiles.

259
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,620
 But bear their interesting story.

260
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,100
 And it comes to, I get, listen, I get the idea of saying, if we sit around and wait for the

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,220
 entire world to decide to do this, it may be too late.

262
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,580
 I understand the logic.

263
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:57,920
 But on the other hand, if every other scientist in this field is telling you to stop, you

264
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,240
 probably should stop.

265
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,480
 But you can't make them.

266
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,160
 Again, this is, it comes down to rogue scientists, where you have people saying, "We're going

267
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
 to launch these balloons because we can't wait."

268
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 And that's the thing.

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 We'll wrap it up like this.

270
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
 I find it so interesting.

271
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,000
 The most compelling villains have understandable motives.

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,180
 If not, I think, but here's the thing.

273
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,300
 I'm not going to talk about Thanos or anything like that.

274
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:30,500
 When you look at Ted Kaczynski, the unabomber, he, sure, he loved blowing up innocent people.

275
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,700
 I mean, that's the first thing that you don't want to sing on a resume.

276
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,500
 Someone's going to get a job with you.

277
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:45,140
 But his goal was to de-technologize the world.

278
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,260
 He was like the world.

279
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,240
 The modern world has become sick.

280
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 This is so funny.

281
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,320
 This is way before the internet and smartphones, a little bit of internet, but not like it

282
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 is today.

283
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,360
 Social media, smartphones, all that stuff, self-driving cars.

284
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,680
 He's like, "Society's sick.

285
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,280
 It has too much technology to it.

286
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080
 We're losing connection to nature."

287
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,880
 He built his bombs out of natural parts.

288
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 Wooden bombs.

289
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 Wooden bombs.

290
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,520
 He's like, "Oh, I shaved the gunpowder myself.

291
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,760
 I mined it out of a mind and used the woodpeckers beak as the firing pin."

292
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,740
 He made these bombs 100% natural, 100% organic killing machines.

293
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:29,940
 So you could say his means was terrible, blowing people up, but his motive wasn't.

294
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,460
 I mean, again, I'm not saying, I don't want to live in that world.

295
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,340
 I like social media and I obviously have a podcast and stuff like that.

296
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,140
 That doesn't exist in his world.

297
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,420
 I'm writing stuff down and giving it to carrier pigeons and I'm like, "Fly, fly away."

298
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,280
 I don't want to live in that world, but I can understand someone who would.

299
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,360
 And again, he's like, "Well, no one's making a change, so I guess I got to blow up all

300
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 these people."

301
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,080
 It's interesting that I used him as an example because there is a theory, a conspiracy theory,

302
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,680
 that he really just like blowing people up.

303
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,960
 And then he retconned a theory.

304
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,440
 He retconned a, because he wrote that big manifesto afterwards.

305
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,780
 And it's so funny to note, I remember when the Unabomber wrote his manifesto, you could

306
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,940
 buy it at a bookstore.

307
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
 They published it.

308
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,740
 It was like 20,000 words or something like that, maybe even more.

309
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
 They published it.

310
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,820
 You could read his manifesto.

311
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,580
 Could you imagine them doing that today?

312
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,900
 Isn't that really interesting?

313
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,700
 And that would have been like the late 90s was when he got caught.

314
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,980
 His brother had recognized phrases and beliefs.

315
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,720
 Actually, that shoots that conspiracy theory out of the water because he had the brother

316
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
 read the manifesto.

317
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,360
 We didn't know who the Unabomber was.

318
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,920
 He didn't say buy Ted Kazinsky on the manifesto.

319
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,520
 People were like, "Oh, my favorite author.

320
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,920
 I hope he publishes more books soon."

321
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,680
 He recognized phrases that his brother used.

322
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
 "I'm going to kill you all."

323
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
 He was like, "Yeah, my brother did often mention about killing us all with a wooden bomb."

324
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,040
 We thought it was weird growing up, but now it all makes sense.

325
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,320
 Phrases that his brother used and beliefs that his brother had.

326
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,100
 So, Ted Kazinsky's brother was reading the manifesto and he's like, "Oh, Ted.

327
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
 Ted.

328
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,980
 Teddy, teddy, teddy."

329
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
 And turned his brother in.

330
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,380
 Now he sleeps on a pile of reward money every night.

331
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
 That'd be hard.

332
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
 I shouldn't make fun of that.

333
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
 That'd be hard to turn your brother in.

334
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,460
 But anyways, you understand the motive.

335
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,420
 When you look at somebody like...

336
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,940
 Who's that guy?

337
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,820
 This one's probably more controversial to bring up.

338
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,200
 Then we'll move on because I could keep doing this.

339
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,320
 It's on the tip of my tongue.

340
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,080
 I'm pretty good at remembering my mass killers.

341
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 Timothy McVeigh.

342
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,960
 Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and the third...

343
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,480
 There was a third guy involved in that.

344
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,680
 I 100% believe...

345
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
 My conspiracy theory...

346
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,680
 I know I'm going to go on a little off script here, which I'm not known to do.

347
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,120
 My conspiracy theory is that Timothy McVeigh...

348
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,320
 There's evidence to back this up.

349
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,980
 Timothy McVeigh was funded and assisted by Al Qaeda.

350
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,420
 I think the Oklahoma City bombing was funded by Al Qaeda.

351
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,020
 I don't believe he acted alone.

352
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,940
 Well, you know, Terry Nichols got arrested as well.

353
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,620
 Because Timothy McVeigh never talked.

354
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,620
 Like, I mean, he was in Super Max, he was in Super Max, he was in Super Max, he was in

355
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
 Super Max, he was in Super Max, he was in Super Max, he was in Super Max, he was in

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,620
 Super Max, I'm not, you know what, get the documentary dude, get Sir David Attenborough

454
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,620
 up here, talk to him, he called him fascist, he started it, he said they were much

455
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,620
 fascist, actually he gave that interview before this company even existed, but he's like,

456
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,620
 "You can't do this, you guys can't do this, this is going to cause havoc." That should

457
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,620
 be the name of them, when they take off all of the make sunsets banners, they rip them

458
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,620
 down, all of a sudden it says "Havoc", actually I think that was the bad guy group from that

459
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,620
 cartoon mask, but still, I think it would be, if you're going to try to destroy the

460
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,620
 world's weather systems, embrace it, start having all your employees wearing menacing

461
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,620
 costumes and maybe you know that your CEO can be like horribly burned in a sulfur

462
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:45,620
 accident and then he has to wear like a metal mask in the shape of a sun and he just like

463
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,620
 interrupts the Super Bowl one day, you're just sitting there watching a bunch of people

464
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,620
 throwing the old pig skin around and then all of a sudden you're, and then it's like

465
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,620
 just a picture of some dude in a, is this a new commercial for Sunny D or something like

466
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,620
 that, why is he wearing that big sun mask and he gives us a huge speech about how he

467
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,620
 now controls the world's weather and then when it goes back to the Super Bowl and

468
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,620
 snowing they're like, "Ahh, we didn't expect to play this game in the snow, we're in

469
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,620
 Tampa, Florida, but let's keep going and then you're like, "Ahh, you know, better go

470
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,620
 check my wheat fields and make sure they're not destroyed."

471
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,620
 Burnt Toseco, so I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the world's famous

472
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,620
 carbonicopter, we are leaving behind the rim of this volcano, take us all the way out

473
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,620
 to Ohio.

474

 We're in, or near, Bethel, Ohio. This takes place back on December 1st, 1996, late one

475
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:46,620
 night. Back in 1996 you had two hunters and they're hunting dogs, "Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

476
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:57,620
 night. Back in 1996 you had two hunters and they're hunting dogs, walking through this

477
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,620
 harvested corn field and the hunters are like, "Yeah, there's probably stuff to hunt around

478
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,620
 here, right? Probably some crows that are still looking for some corn to eat, maybe

479
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,620
 a porcupine or something like that. This is their first day hunting, they don't really

480
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,620
 know how to do it. They're going to let the dogs lead the way, so they let their hunting

481
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,620
 dogs loose, the dogs are just tearing through the area. "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo,
