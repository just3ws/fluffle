1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 the mechanical death traps that lay all around us.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,100
 And then,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,300
 we cover a story that reminded me of why I love doing this show so much.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,400
 Get your backpacks on.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,400
 We're headed into the ravine today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,400
 Hope you guys had a great weekend.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,700
 It was pretty chill out here.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,400
 The weather's been pretty nice.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,500
 I was doing some research and I found a fascinating story for you.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,100
 We're gonna do that second.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
 Also, while I was researching that,

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
 I found a series of stories that were gruesome

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,900
 and scarily mundane.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,100
 Scarily weird. Is scarily a word?

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,300
 Anyways, okay, they were scary.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,100
 So, we're gonna start off with that.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,300
 Now, I was trapped in an elevator when I was a little boy.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,500
 I had to have been.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,400
 It was probably back in like, in 1982, 1983.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
 So, I would have been about six or seven years old.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,800
 And this was when my dad was still in college and we lived on campus.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
 And it was funny.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,200
 A bunch of crazy stuff happened at that campus.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
 Some dude robbed a comic book store.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,100
 And he was selling all the comics for like 25 cents, 50 cents each.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,100
 And I got Daredevil issue two through like maybe 28 for like a couple bucks.

30
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,400
 Which back then, to be fair, a quarter, you know,

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
 you could go to the movies by popcorn and six pack of beer.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,100
 Like back in the 80s, money went much further.

33
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,800
 That's why Daredevil is actually one of my favorite heroes.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 It was the first comic book.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 I read all those stolen comics from the local comic book store.

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,700
 But anyways, California Baptist College in Riverside, California.

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,200
 I was trapped in an elevator with my older brother and two hot co-eds.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,900
 Now, I didn't know they were hot at the time.

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,100
 I kind of had a feeling that they were hot, but I was like seven.

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,000
 You know, I wasn't really that into girls, plus they were brunettes.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,600
 So, you know, but it sucked.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,900
 It totally sucked.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,900
 We were in there for a couple hours and I was crying the whole time

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
 and I wanted to pee my pants.

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,000
 And my older brother was like, if you weren't there, man,

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
 I would have gotten their phone numbers.

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
 He was like 12 at the time.

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
 Anyways, so they spent the time.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,300
 But maybe I was pretending to cry because I wanted to get some motherly love from these hot.

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,900
 I most likely actually was crying and peeing my pants.

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,900
 Anyways, even through that whole experience, I never became afraid of elevators.

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,800
 Never developed an elevator fetish either, which is kind of odd now that I think about it.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
 But I wonder if people do have elevator.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,100
 That's a stupid question.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,700
 Of course, people have elevator fetishes.

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,600
 Um, looking at, I've never had a, what I'm trying to say is I've never had a fear of elevators.

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,100
 But when you really kind of step back and think about it, it's one of the most bizarre modes of

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:04,700
 transportation that we use because most of the other ones we have, other than some Marines

59
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,700
 you can look out of or armored car.

60
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,400
 You're being transported because the Joker is trying to kill you.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,500
 Like for the most part, transportation's are designed as a level of comfort and visibility.

62
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,300
 People do not like being trapped in places with no windows and you get into this box that closes

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,900
 and then for a certain amount of time, it moves in one direction or another.

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,900
 Like elevators, you know how elevators work, but when that door reopens, you have no idea what's on

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
 the other side of that door.

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,100
 You could get in an elevator, the door closed.

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,100
 It goes up five levels, door open fire, door open zombie apocalypse, door opens any possibility

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
 because you can't see out of it.

69
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,500
 Now, of course, now that I'm saying that I realize there are different types of elevators

70
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,900
 and some of them are like cargo elevators where you can visibly see they're not worried about

71
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,700
 zombie stumbling in, but consumer level elevators are quite scary in a sense.

72
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,300
 So that whole segue goes into this.

73
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,800
 I think people are always afraid of elevators like plummeting like you're in an elevator and you think

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,500
 if this falls down, have they been falling up?

75
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,600
 If you die in an elevator, like could you jump the last moment?

76
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,300
 Apparently you're supposed to lay down in the middle of an elevator.

77
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,400
 So you can like you have to be right in the middle of the elevator and you make your body as wide as possible.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
 That will help absorb the impact.

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,200
 So you don't die.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,100
 But the problem is, is when's the last time you've been on an elevator by yourself?

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,600
 So don't tell anyone else that tip.

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
 So if you're ever in an elevator with someone else and it starts to fall, you get down on the ground,

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,400
 spread out in the middle and if someone's screaming, what are you doing?

84
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,100
 What are you doing?

85
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,800
 You say, I'm going to take the full blow of the impact for you, my love.

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
 You will survive this impact.

87
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,900
 I will die for you and then they get horribly mangled and you're fine.

88
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,200
 Well, I'm sure you have massive internal bleeding, but you're probably going to live.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,700
 Don't tell anyone else that tip because otherwise everyone's going to be fighting for the middle spot.

90
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,200
 Getting to the point of this story, getting to the point of the story.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,300
 There was a very famous incident of a man in New York who was trapped in an elevator.

92
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
 I don't know why I forgot that word all of a sudden.

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,300
 That's all I've been talking about was trapped in an elevator for 41 hours and there's actually video footage of him

94
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,800
 and what he endured during that 41 hours.

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,500
 Now, it's something I wouldn't have thought about at the time, but I would think, well,

96
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,900
 cover this for another episode.

97
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,900
 If I was trapped in an elevator by myself for a period of time, I would most likely start masturbating at some point.

98
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,100
 But I didn't realize what there would be video cameras in there and two, the lights are always on.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
 And now that doesn't mean that I have to masturbate in the dark.

100
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,100
 What I mean is that you couldn't sleep because elevators tend to be fairly bright.

101
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,700
 So that would suck.

102
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,400
 Like you could see the guy trying to sleep, but there's just giant light right over him.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,700
 You see him trying to do a bunch of stuff.

104
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,900
 It's a fascinating video that's in the links.

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's in the show notes, but you're like, oh, that's an interesting experience.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200
 You can tell his grandkids about that.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,100
 So except the masturbating part.

108
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,700
 However, though, not all stories end as well.

109
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
 We're going to the year 2016.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,100
 So very, very recent, very, very recent story here.

111
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,700
 We're going to China and it's January.

112
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,400
 Now, the reason why that's important is because it's Chinese New Year.

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:22,000
 So generally for Chinese New Year, you get a week off, but a lot of times workers will take days before off and days after off.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,300
 And there was this elevator that needed to be repaired and the repairmen were like, we'll get to it after Chinese.

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,300
 I wonder if they call it Chinese New Year over there because we don't call it American New Year over here.

116
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
 I'm sure that it's some other name.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,600
 But anyway, so they're like after this holiday that we don't know what the name of it is, we'll come back.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
 And so they make the elevator go.

119
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
 This is like an apartment complex.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,100
 They make the elevator go all the way down to the first floor.

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300
 They walk over to it and goes, anyone in there?

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,900
 No one says anything.

123
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:57,900
 So they go, no one must be in there and they leave a month later after they're done partying or whatever they do during Chinese New Year.

124
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,800
 They come back and the maintenance men come back to the elevator and the apartment complex to work on it.

125
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 So for the whole month, no one had been able to use the elevator stairs, stairs all the way up.

126
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,600
 They open up the elevator and there is a woman in there.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,300
 Her hands mangled from trying to claw open the doors.

128
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,600
 She'd been in there for a month.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
 Dead.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
 I guess I have to add that part too.

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
 She's dead mangled hands.

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,700
 She's dead.

133
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 Now, one of the maintenance workers was actually held for negligent homicide, who's actually charged for it.

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 What's interesting was that happened in 2016.

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,500
 I wasn't able to find any follow-up articles as to whether or not this guy was actually convicted of it.

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,300
 It's also weird that we don't really have a name for the woman.

137
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,900
 It could be from a privacy thing, but all we have is her surname, which is Wu.

138
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,700
 And she was in her late thirties to early forties.

139
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,500
 That's all they're from me.

140
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,900
 And so at this point, I'm thinking this story actually might not be true.

141
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,600
 We really don't have a lot of information on it.

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,100
 And every article kind of says the exact same details.

143
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,300
 This is her last name.

144
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,100
 They don't know how old she is.

145
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
 It was kind of weird.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
 And then people in the apartment complex for one and journalists overall were saying,

147
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,200
 how come no one noticed this woman was missing for a month?

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,000
 And then it kind of spun out into this thing.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,700
 I read an article saying that single women should have an app on their phone to alert.

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,200
 They don't press the button every day.

151
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,600
 Their loved ones come looking for them.

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,000
 I'm thinking, isn't that what we do to like six year olds or people who are like severely

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,900
 mentally disabled?

154
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,600
 I can't believe someone suggested that women should have an app or they have to check in

155
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,200
 every day.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
 But anyway, someone did.

157
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
 There's one.

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,500
 And I read that.

159
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,600
 I was like, that'd be gruesome.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
 And the thing is people go, oh, she was trapped in there for a month.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
 Technically, no, she wasn't.

162
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,300
 I mean, you can go between three days and a week without water.

163
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,500
 So, I mean, look on the bright side.

164
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
 She was only trapped in there for a week most.

165
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,300
 But dying of dehydration.

166
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,000
 I actually had a monoflare up a couple of years ago.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
 My throat swelled shut.

168
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,300
 I didn't know what it was.

169
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,400
 I didn't have insurance.

170
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,300
 I was just sitting in my grandma's house getting worse and worse and worse waiting for

171
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,700
 whatever I had to break.

172
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
 And I went three days without drinking anything.

173
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,300
 It was too painful.

174
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,500
 I could barely talk.

175
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,800
 And going three days without any.

176
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,700
 I think within three days, I had one coffee cup full of water.

177
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,900
 That's all I could get down.

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
 Most painful.

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,000
 Hore.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,800
 I felt like that was the closest I ever came to dying a natural death.

181
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,900
 I could feel my body like shutting down.

182
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,200
 Finally, a friend came over.

183
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
 Chelsea came over, took me to the ER.

184
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,700
 They put an IV in me and I told the nurse when I got that first burst of liquid, I

185
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,600
 said, it's like taking a shower in sprite.

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,900
 It was the most refreshing feeling I'd ever had in my life.

187
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,400
 I was that close to just dying and then all of a sudden my body was full of liquid.

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,300
 It was beautiful.

189
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,900
 It's beautiful.

190
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,200
 Anyways, to end that story on a less beautiful note, as I'm reading about this elevator thing,

191
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,500
 apparently China has a big problem over there.

192
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,600
 They had one month where five people go actually nothing about it.

193
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 Yeah, five people died in one month in China due to elevator accidents, but China

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 also has a lot of people and it's quite big.

195
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,800
 So I mean, you could just be statistical, but they have a lot of industrial problems over there.

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,500
 There's so many videos of people.

197
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,000
 One of the videos is a guy is getting, it's horrible that you can watch this online,

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,200
 but there's a guy getting in an elevator and the elevator starts going up while he's halfway

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
 and halfway out and then it goes up too fast and it like compresses him.

200
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,500
 Not like an accordion.

201
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,900
 He's not Tom and Jerry, but like he gets crushed in between the top of the elevator

202
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
 and the floor going up.

203
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,500
 And so his knee is pressed up against his shoulder and his other leg is hanging out

204
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 of the elevator and then it stops because it's jammed and he suffocates.

205
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,100
 So it's not even like he got chopped in half like Final Destination.

206
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,900
 It wasn't a quick death.

207
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,800
 He just kind of sat there and suffocated while his friends were watching.

208
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 Horrible.

209
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 But if you think that's bad, I hope you don't have an escalator fetish because we're still in China

210
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,400
 for this one.

211
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,600
 This story was, you're like, Jason, why are you starting off with these industrial accident stories?

212
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
 I just found this so interesting because these are things we use every single day for the most part.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,700
 I mean, I don't use escalators all the time, but you know, I use them occasionally.

214
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
 I didn't even know this was a thing.

215
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 Once my shoelace got stuck in an escalator, but I mean, that was fine.

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
 I just pulled my foot.

217
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,500
 Actually, my dad pulled my foot until the shoelace broke.

218
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 So in China, though, there's a one, just fairly recent as well.

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,400
 This happened before the elevator incident.

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,700
 There's this video footage of two maintenance workers at a mall.

221
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,900
 There's an, they're standing at the top of an escalator and they're discussing something, right?

222
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,400
 And you see a woman and her son who appears to maybe be like six or seven coming up the escalator.

223
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,500
 And the two guys are just kind of standing there.

224
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,900
 And when the woman and her son get to the top of the escalator,

225
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:53,400
 she takes a step onto where you would assume it's supposed to be solid ground and no any sort of quicksand dish type technology.

226
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,500
 But when she steps off the escalator, she steps on a metal plate that then flips off.

227
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
 It wasn't attached, right?

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
 She falls into the gears of the escalator and it eats her.

229
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
 It just grinds her up.

230
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,100
 And as she's getting horribly, horribly mangled, she pushes her son to the workers,

231
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,900
 clear of the machinery and she gets chewed up.

232
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,000
 There's video of that too.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,100
 And I was like, I'm not watching that video.

234
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,000
 I didn't watch the elevator video, but they're like warning.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,300
 There may be gruesome footage in this video and then they just show you still photographs from the camera.

236
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,900
 Like as I'm reading the article of one, a guy like stuck in an elevator and then the other one,

237
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,600
 half a woman in a machine, pushing her son.

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,100
 I'm like, if you're warning me that they've don't not to watch the video,

239
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,500
 why are you showing me some of the photographs from it?

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 It's just as bad.

241
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,900
 But anyways, apparently just chewed her up and they the answer to all that.

242
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,300
 The newspaper in China, the next day, ran an article telling you how to shut off an escalator.

243
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,000
 Wasn't the escalators fault?

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
 Woman should have known how to hit that button.

245
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
 So there we go.

246
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
 Our escalator slash elevator, or should we call them?

247
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,800
 Helivators, those little simple things we used to, I want to say teleport,

248
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,600
 those little simple things we used to transport around millions of people use them every day.

249
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,900
 Some people get squished.

250
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,700
 It's bizarre.

251
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,000
 I mean, and to make it even worse, the escalator as the woman was getting chewed up and the maintenance guys were working there.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
 Everyone else is just shopping.

253
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,500
 The dad, the dad of the boy was on another floor shopping and then eventually he sees a commotion.

254
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,300
 He goes down there.

255
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
 His wife's jelly.

256
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,300
 Bizarre, dude.

257
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
 That would totally ruin your shopping experience.

258
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,600
 That would totally, I mean, you would just be bummed out forever.

259
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,900
 So from that, let's go ahead and move on to the ravine.

260
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:48,600
 Now, the ravine story is one of those things is as I was researching it, I was like, hmm.

261
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
 And I do that a lot.

262
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,100
 But then when I get to the end of it, I'm like, and I type up all my notes and I'm like, okay,

263
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,200
 I kind of know what approach I'm taking with this.

264
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,700
 But let's start off.

265
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,500
 I will take you down the same path that I traveled.

266
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,700
 The year 1970s, very, very vague thing.

267
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,600
 So right here you think, hmm, this is most likely fake, but 1970s.

268
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,700
 I found this article about this event that supposedly took place in the 1970s in South America, I believe.

269
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,500
 There was a college professor, an unnamed college professor.

270
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,300
 We've done enough episodes where we again, know where this story is going.

271
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,500
 Though the year is there's no specific year.

272
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,400
 There's no specific name.

273
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:34,500
 We do know that this college professor taught at a college called the University of the Andes.

274
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,800
 He walks out of his office one day after school, talks to a couple of his colleagues, talks to a couple of students.

275
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
 He's walking out to the parking lot, generally just a liked guy.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,100
 People know who he is.

277
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,300
 They don't say his name, but we'll assume he was very popular before.

278
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,700
 And once this unnamed college professor gets to his car, someone says his name, he turns to him, he waves goodbye to him, gets into the car.

279
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,900
 And then no one ever saw him again.

280
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,100
 The car was still in the parking lot.

281
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,800
 The last anyone saw was him getting in the car.

282
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
 They never saw the car drive away.

283
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,600
 He's been missing for 40 years.

284
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,700
 Now, that supposedly was written up in the L timepo, which is Venezuela's largest newspaper.

285
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,800
 It was supposedly written up by a journalist known as Sugunda Pena.

286
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,800
 You'll see article after article referring to this very vague event and they'll say, here's the article and you click on it.

287
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
 It says page not found.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,800
 So it's possible the story never existed.

289
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,600
 It started as an internet legend and they just linked it to a page that never was there.

290
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:44,900
 It's possible that the story was published by that newspaper at some point, but I see that from time to time where older articles are no longer found on that website.

291
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,300
 But they did exist at one point because I have them cash shade somewhere else.

292
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,200
 Or it could be that it was it was in the newspaper and then they realized that this story is ridiculous and then they removed it from their website.

293
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,600
 All three of those are possible, but I can't get any more information on that and there's just nothing specific about it.

294
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,000
 So who knows whether or not it's true in any way, shape, or form.

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
 But as I kept researching that, I found this story.

296
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:21,500
 This is the story of the girl of the pairs or the pair girl and pair as in like a fruit that you eat, not as like two of kind.

297
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,300
 Let's hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible because we're going to leave Venezuela.

298
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,500
 We got across the Atlantic.

299
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,300
 We're going to Spain specifically.

300
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,400
 We're going to the island of Tenerife.

301
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,700
 Tenerife.

302
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,900
 It's one of the it's the largest island in the Canary Islands.

303
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
 So we float over there on the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

304
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,700
 We're going back in time to the year 1910 and we're in the year 1910 and there's a young girl there, not named.

305
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,200
 So again, a little suspicious.

306
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,000
 Again, some people place this story not in 1910, but 1905.

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So as I'm reading this, I'm thinking it's still fairly vague.

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,300
 We have a girl who's not named.

309
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:07,400
 Could there's a five year difference between when the story may have taken place and for the most part it is considered a legend in the area.

310
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:15,800
 This young girl is just chilling at her house and they're all eating lunch and the mom says, honey, will you go?

311
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,600
 We'll just call her honey.

312
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,500
 Honey, will you go to the pair farm?

313
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,200
 The pair orchard, I guess the right word.

314
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,900
 Your dad wants pears for dessert and she's like, yes, mama, I will go get pears.

315
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,200
 That'll be a fun adventure.

316
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,800
 I'll go get my friends and the mom's like, yeah, your friends because she knows she doesn't have any friends.

317
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,500
 She's kind of loser.

318
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,000
 So honey goes out into the village and tries to round up some friends.

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,900
 Says, hey, do you guys want to go pick pears for my dad?

320
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,300
 He knew.

321
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,800
 Well, who I imagine like you just don't need a pair for dessert.

322
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,400
 I figure if that you just have pears on the dinner table, they probably like covered him in honey or sugar or something.

323
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,000
 But anyways, so she's like, hey, do you guys want to go into the orchard with me to go get pears and her friends?

324
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 She actually did have friends.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,900
 Her mom just doesn't think very highly of her.

326
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,000
 Her friends go, oh, no way, dude, because we know where that pair orchard is.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:17,400
 Now, this pair orchard was owned by the honey's family and it was in a place called Baranco de Chamoco and that area is littered with caves and going far, far back.

328
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,700
 The people living there believe that the caves are inhabited by spirits.

329
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
 It's not a place you want to go.

330
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,700
 It's definitely not a place you want to go as a child.

331
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,200
 The whole place is just generally spooky.

332
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,400
 It's basically Elm Street, but a ravine full of caves and people disappear.

333
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,600
 So she can't get any of her friends to go with her.

334
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,500
 She goes, well, I got to go get the pears.

335
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,400
 Like I have to go.

336
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,500
 So she goes off into the ravine and she starts picking pears.

337
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,300
 And when she's in the ravine, she starts to feel just the heat of the sun on her.

338
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,800
 She's like, oh my God, it's so hot.

339
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 I wish my dad didn't eat pears.

340
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,900
 I wish my dad was allergic to pears and I can give him one and he just swell up and die.

341
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,100
 I hate my dad so much.

342
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,600
 I hate him so much.

343
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,500
 But as she's having these horrible thoughts, just the sun's beaten down on her.

344
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,300
 And she begins to notice a very cool mist in the area and she's thinking, that's not normal.

345
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:17,200
 And she's watching this mist kind of roll through the ravine.

346
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,000
 And it's enveloping her skin and she just immediately feels a cool relief from the hot, hot sun.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,100
 She's almost lost in the mist at this point.

348
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,700
 And that's when a tall figure dressed in all white appears out of the mist.

349
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,300
 And leads her down what she described as an impossibly long corridor.

350
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,700
 And she goes, at first I was scared, obviously, because this is something completely out of the ordinary.

351
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:50,300
 But I felt compelled to keep walking and the creature or the person or whatever it was kept making hand signals.

352
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:57,500
 That's the only way it could communicate with honey was by making hand signals to her of where to go, how to follow her.

353
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 And that was the only way the creature could communicate with honey.

354
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,100
 So they walk all the way down this passage and eventually she said it opened up into a beautiful orchard.

355
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,500
 Like they were on this little like precipice and she looked down and she saw this orchard going as far as the eye could see.

356
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,800
 She said every type of fruit, every type of tree you can imagine was there.

357
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,400
 And the valley was littered with people just like the stranger who let her down the cave.

358
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,100
 She said it looked like a watercolor painting in motion.

359
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,800
 She's the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

360
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,100
 She immediately felt this just sense of peace and joy come over her.

361
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,800
 Now when I'm reading this, I'm thinking at this point what she inhaled was most likely some sort of noxious or toxic gas.

362
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,000
 And she had a near-death experience.

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
 We have the tunnel of light.

364
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,300
 We have the over beat overcome with a sense of joy and wonder.

365
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,400
 We have a guardian angel type figure.

366
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,300
 And I'm like, okay, she walked out there, the earth farted.

367
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,800
 She started to pass out because of some sort of carbon dioxide overdose.

368
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,700
 And then she woke up.

369
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:04,300
 But as I'm continuing to read the story, she's in the cave and eventually her guide, the tall being,

370
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,000
 began to motion her away and motioned her back down with his hand saying,

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 "Come here, come here.

372
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,800
 You can do it.

373
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,100
 Oh, good girl, good girl."

374
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,700
 Motioning her, that's the only way they could communicate back down the corridor.

375
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,200
 And then she finds herself back in the pear orchard.

376
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,600
 But the first thing she notices, the cool mist is gone and it is 10, 15 degrees hotter than when she left.

377
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 And she's thinking, there is no way it could be this hot all of a sudden.

378
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 Now she's getting scared again because now she's back in our world

379
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,500
 and she's experiencing something that she shouldn't experience.

380
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,100
 So anyway, she gets to Paris because she still has to do her job.

381
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,500
 And she's just figuring out, tell them about the monster people in the valley and all that stuff.

382
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,600
 It'll be a cool story while we're eating pears.

383
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,700
 She makes her way out of the ravine and she notices a road that wasn't there when she went into the ravine.

384
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,300
 She's like, "Uh-oh.

385
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
 Is this something?"

386
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
 Okay, okay.

387
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,400
 And as she's walking down the road, she begins to see cars driving on the road,

388
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,300
 which she described as futuristic looking cars.

389
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,400
 But she is finally able to make her way home.

390
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,100
 And there her mother, her now middle-aged mother greets her.

391
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,900
 It's the year 1940, 30 years past while she was in the ravine.

392
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,500
 And the mother calls out and says, "It's my girl. It's my girl."

393
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,700
 Her name was, her name became, or the story is, La Nina de Las Peres,

394
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,300
 Peras, or the Paragirl is how it's kind of known.

395
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,700
 So it's a local legend in that area about this girl who went looking for pears in this ravine

396
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,800
 that everyone knows is haunted and then came back 30 years later.

397
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,400
 So interesting story, possible proof of a time slip,

398
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,000
 most likely a local legend of a spooky place.

399
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,700
 And again, a lot of these legends have a core moral value.

400
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,600
 This one would be kids don't go there alone.

401
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,400
 If you go there alone, something bad may happen.

402
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
 Stay out of there.

403
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,700
 You know, that's how these urban legends are created.

404
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,200
 But as I'm reading that article, I go, "This sounds familiar.

405
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,500
 This sounds really familiar."

406
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
 You know, when I watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

407
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,900
 it's funny because my favorite character on that show was Giles.

408
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,700
 Love that, love that character.

409
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,500
 I always loved the idea of like researching books and like having like five books out on the table

410
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,400
 and going through it and trying to like solve this mystery.

411
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,700
 He was always my favorite character.

412
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,600
 I always felt more like, I always felt he was the most relatable one

413
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,200
 because that's kind of the way that I approached stuff.

414
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,300
 Not like I ever fought demons, actually I did,

415
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,900
 but the point is is that I always liked that ideal and even that visual,

416
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,100
 asianic, whatever, that thing that you look at and you go, "I like that."

417
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,800
 So, I'm reading this article in the coffee shop.

418
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,700
 It was getting ready to just be another weird disappearing thing.

419
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
 I was going to do about the guy in the car and then go,

420
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,300
 "Oh, here's a local legend I found too."

421
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,900
 But as I'm reading it, I said, "I've heard this story."

422
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,600
 And not only have I heard it, I heard it almost 2,000 miles away.

423
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,300
 We're going to Moscow.

424
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,100
 So, outside of Moscow, there is a place known as Golosov Ravine.

425
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,300
 In the year 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen,

426
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,700
 we've covered them before in the Great Mud Flood thing,

427
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,700
 the empire that's pretty much been erased from the history books.

428
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,100
 In 1621, a detachment of Tatar horsemen show up at the Tsarist Palace

429
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,300
 and are immediately taken prisoner because they shouldn't be there at all.

430
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,900
 And when they're being questioned, they go, "What are you doing here?

431
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,500
 Why did a bunch of Caldremen show up here in the middle of the day?"

432
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,200
 And they go, "We have some questions."

433
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
 Yes, to be fair, we did try invading you guys,

434
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,700
 but something's wrong. Something's off.

435
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:56,400
 And as they're basically being questioned by the Russian forces,

436
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
 because the Tsatara Empire and the Russians did not like each other,

437
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,900
 I guess if you didn't listen to that episode, they hated each other actually.

438
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,400
 But anyways, as the Russians were trying to figure out

439
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,100
 why these guys showed up in the middle of nowhere,

440
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,600
 they started to notice something.

441
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 One, they appeared out of the middle of nowhere,

442
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,100
 but two, their armor was old and not like old and rusted and busted and stuff like that.

443
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,600
 It was an old-style armor.

444
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:28,800
 It was an armor that the Tsatara Empire had not used since 1570, 50 years earlier.

445
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:35,300
 And what the Tsatara soldiers were saying was, "Listen, we were there at the Battle of Moscow.

446
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,000
 You guys started with an R-Butt. You guys are far more better prepared than we gave you credit for."

447
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,400
 So we, us group of guys, took off.

448
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,600
 And we hid, and the investigators going, "Let me guess, let me guess.

449
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,400
 You hid in Golosov Ravine."

450
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,300
 Tsatara soldiers like, "Yeah, how'd you know?"

451
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,600
 And the Russians go, "You know, that place is haunted. We don't... It's not a place that we go.

452
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,300
 It's just this weird placement, a lot of disappearances and stuff like that there."

453
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,100
 And this may be the cause of a lie.

454
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,600
 And the Tsatara soldiers said, "Yes, we went, we hid in the ravine,

455
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,700
 and a mist rolled through the ravine."

456
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,800
 The next thing we knew, we came out of the ravine.

457
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,600
 We noticed things weren't right.

458
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,700
 None of our other soldiers were here.

459
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,400
 Couldn't get a hold of anybody.

460
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,200
 Lost and with nothing else to do, we came back to Moscow thinking,

461
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,700
 "Hey, maybe we won the battle."

462
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,600
 Or, "Maybe we could just get some answers."

463
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
 But that's not it.

464
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,200
 That's not what I was reminded of when I read the story of the Paragirl.

465
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 Golosov Ravine, 1832.

466
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,300
 Two local peasants get drunk.

467
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,600
 They're having a good time, just hanging out.

468
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,100
 Just chilling.

469
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,700
 Throwing their arms around each other, tickling each other.

470
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,900
 And these two peasants say, "You know what?

471
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,000
 Let's take a shortcut home through Golosov Ravine."

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,100
 I'm like, "Okay, why'd you pronounce it differently that time

473
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
 than you did every other time?"

474
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,700
 He's like, "I don't know. I'm drunk."

475
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,600
 So these two peasants go into the ravine.

476
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 A mist rolls through.

477
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
 They come out of the ravine.

478
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,900
 Twenty years had passed.

479
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 When they get home, their wives don't recognize them.

480
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,600
 But they had a bit of a different twist on their story.

481
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
 They said, when the two peasants said, "When we went into the ravine,

482
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,700
 the mist rolled through, and a giant corridor appeared out of nowhere."

483
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,100
 Out of that corridor, a tall, hairy person walked

484
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,100
 and communicated with us, only using their hands

485
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,000
 and led us back out of the corridor.

486
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,700
 The Tatar story and the two peasants' story, supposedly,

487
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,200
 were both investigated by the government.

488
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,700
 The Tatar story was apparently like that.

489
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,700
 It was an official report was filed with the Russian government

490
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,300
 over why these soldiers showed up out of nowhere.

491
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,000
 And again, reportedly, the peasants' story was an official police transcript.

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,500
 And when the police went out to the ravine to investigate

493
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,600
 whether or not their story was true, one of the officers disappeared.

494
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 Those particular details, I can't verify.

495
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
 I found articles talking about it, but I couldn't find actually

496
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,900
 a police report from 1832.

497
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,300
 Those may or may not exist.

498
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,400
 What I find fascinating is these two stories,

499
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,100
 one in Golosov Ravine and one in the Canary Islands,

500
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,700
 separated by decades and thousands of miles, have similarities.

501
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,500
 Now, normally, if the story is completely made up,

502
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,400
 they will say this is similar to what happened at Golosov Ravine.

503
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,500
 Or Golosov Ravine's story, if they took the idea from the Paragirl,

504
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
 they'll say, "You know, there's precedence for this.

505
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,400
 Something else like this happened in the Canary Islands."

506
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,500
 As far as I can tell, these two stories have never, ever been connected.

507
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,900
 In all of my research, I have never found one referencing the other.

508
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,000
 The resources on Golosov Ravine are almost all in Russian.

509
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,500
 There's like a short Wikipedia article and a couple articles in English,

510
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,000
 and all of the sourced material is in Russian.

511
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,500
 How did you translate and stuff?

512
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,600
 The Canary story, again, like I had to go to websites and translate from Spanish.

513
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,100
 These two stories, as far as I can tell, have never been connected.

514
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,900
 And they both, even if certain details are wrong, like the 1905 to the 1910,

515
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:38,400
 the details of a ravine full of mist, a long tunnel, a tall person,

516
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
 one of them they're hairy and one of them they're just tall.

517
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,700
 They don't say how much hair they have.

518
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,800
 They could be like a smooth otter body.

519
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,900
 Could be a full-on bear.

520
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,600
 We don't know.

521
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,900
 But you have the ravine.

522
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,600
 You have the mist.

523
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,900
 You have the tunnel.

524
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,100
 You have something tall, only communicating with their hands

525
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,400
 and, most importantly of all, time jumps.

526
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,500
 Totally blew my mind when I was reading it and I go,

527
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,000
 and I thought, "This sounds familiar."

528
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And I remember when I was pulling back up my Golosov Ravine,

529
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,100
 which I was going to do as a separate story, just a small story,

530
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,200
 as I was pulling that up, I said,

531
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,500
 "I know it has to do with mist and ravine,

532
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,900
 but I'm pretty sure they also said something about only using their hands to communicate."

533
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,600
 And I pulled it up and that was the case.

534
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,400
 This makes me think that this is very, very real.

535
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,400
 This makes me think that this not only has happened,

536
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,100
 but more interesting enough, can happen again.

537
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,500
 But what's weird is you wouldn't have proof of it for decades.

538
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,200
 Is there a limit to how long you're in that tunnel,

539
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,900
 to how long it takes for you to get out?

540
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
 Even if some sort of parapsychologist wanted to replicate this,

541
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
 he's going to be like, "Okay, seeing in 60 years,

542
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,100
 like, is there any way to test something like that?"

543
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,000
 I honestly think, I could be wrong on this,

544
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 but I honestly think that this is the first time those two events have been connected.

545
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,100
 And if that's the case, this stuff has not been researched at all.

546
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,200
 Because generally, the one in the Canary Islands is considered a local legend.

547
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,400
 It would basically be like if a scientist wanted to investigate

548
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,400
 whether or not there were real witches in Salem.

549
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,700
 Like, you'd be like, "Of course there are not.

550
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,600
 Like, we have all of the...

551
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,900
 It was just a legend people made up to like,

552
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,500
 persecute single women and stuff like that."

553
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,900
 I think these ravines are real.

554
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,200
 I think the mist can send you forward in time.

555
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,700
 I think this story gets added to the list of conspiracies or things, I believe in.

556
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,600
 Because either someone made up these stories decades ago

557
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
 and never connected them

558
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,100
 and just thought it'd be funny if someday someone stumbled across both of them.

559
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:57,800
 Or in two parts of the world, in two similar circumstances,

560
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 people traveled into the future in the same way.

561
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,700
 If this is true, it's groundbreaking.

562
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,300
 If you can warp time like that on Earth,

563
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,400
 if we have a natural time machine that shoots people forward in time,

564
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,100
 do you understand?

565
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,700
 I mean, really, that would change so much.

566
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,600
 But are they real?

567
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
 We'd have to test them.

568
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,100
 And then wait and wait and wait for the answer.

569
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:38,400
 Or we just step into the mists ourselves.
