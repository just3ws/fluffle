 Today we take a ride on a ghost train that is still seen plowing across the deserts of Arizona
 then we meet the
 Unluckiest man in the world until he wasn't and
 Then finally we look at an interesting conspiracy
 And one that has a bit of backing to it was Marilyn Monroe killed
 To cover up the truth of UFOs today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *Music*
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvin
 Or I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover
 So I'm gonna spare you the Star Trek jokes this episode. We're gonna jump right into it. Jump! Weeee!
 Arizona, the state that never sleeps because it's so hot there you can't sleep. That's where we're at
 Arizona. It's just one giant flat state. Every so often you see a giant stump of a tree. Ah, you thought those were amasis?
 No, those are tree stumps, but we're here. We're in the Dragoon Mountains
 Which sounds dope. I think that's the name of French soldiers who shoot guns
 Well, they all do now, but back in the day the Dragoons, I think were the first armed
 French soldiers, but anyways it doesn't matter.
 Between Dragoon and the town of Wilcox, Arizona. This has been spotted multiple times by multiple people over the years.
 A phantom train. Sometimes you just see the light on the train. Not just the light like the sun
 But sometimes you just see like the front of the headlight. Why do you put a headlight on a train? It's not like it can turn
 I guess they could break. By the time the beam of light hits whatever in the
 train's way
 You cannot be able to stop it. I mean how how many lumens did they have back in the 1800s?
 Like I bet you that train that headlight on the train. Oh, oh, I guess it's so other people can see the train coming
 Never mind. So anyways, you learned something Jason. You taught yourself something the train
 Actually, what a ghost train make noise actually a ghost make noise so it makes sense
 Tickets, please you get off the train hobo
 Ghost hobos are getting thrown off the train. They're like just evaporating in nowhere slimmers back there. He's eating all the food slimer
 Anyways, this ghost train's coming through the desert. People have seen it over the years. They've heard it over the years
 They're like why is all these hot dogs just in the middle of the desert?
 The weirdest thing is if the ghost train with hobos and slimer on it aren't weird enough
 There's never been a train laid in the area where the train
 is seen
 Now all the articles I read about the ghost train were like there's a ghost train
 People have seen it and heard it for years, but here's the weird part
 There's never been a train
 Where the ghost train seen and I'm thinking
 So it's not like the train has a ghost. I have a better point better question here. Let's say that
 Okay, so let's say the ghost train exists and it's chugging along in the middle of nowhere a place where train tracks had never been laid down
 Did they see trains like in 600 ad in that area where like the native america?
 That's a bigger question to me not there's never been a train there. Well, who cares if there's not go ghosts don't have trains
 Don't leave ghosts
 So whether or not there's a train there is totally irrelevant to the fact that there is a ghost train
 but
 I think the more interesting question is
 600 ad you have native americans live in in arizona
 I don't know why it's super hot down there and there's no animals, but they're down there
 Was the ghost train there then?
 Would they have seen this thing and they'd have no concept for the noises it made for the size for the speed
 They're like why who are all these ghost hobos? What's a hobo and then everything just vanishes like
 What did they see in that area?
 The apache do consider the area sacred
 Now I will say this I say trains don't have ghosts
 But if there was a train that got lost or derailed and to this day people still say they can see
 The ghost of the train coming down the tracks whatever but this train is in the middle of nowhere
 When did they start seeing it?
 Did people see it before they knew what a train was and the reason why this is an important question?
 If that's true
 If that train has always been there and no one could recognize what it was until other people who and it invented the train
 Saw the train and go oh, that's a train. That's what that is
 Do ghosts work in any sort of time?
 time
 Chain what's timeline?
 Or are they just there?
 Whenever like the ghosts that we see are they people who have died before or is it possible that there are people who will die?
 eventually
 Like if i'm looking at a ghost, how do I know if okay if a ghost train can exist in the middle of nowhere?
 And i'm looking at a ghost in my living room. It's possible that that guy won't die until 50 years from now
 But when he died his soul is trapped in this timeline or it's appearing in this timeline
 But he may still be alive 2 000 years from now. Does that make sense? Like i i
 That's the thing that I always get kind of squirrelly with ghosts is
 Living people measure stuff on a linear timeline because our lives are on a linear timeline
 but to a ghost to something who exists for eternity
 A linear timeline is
 Doesn't make sense
 Does that make sense because technically infinity would or eternity would doesn't it go both ways?
 I don't know man
 You know people always accuse me of smoking weed before I do this show and i'm like
 This is always my response. There was no way I could do a daily show if I smoked marijuana. Absolutely not. I think
 My i'm just perma stone because I did spend a lot of time in my 20s partying
 And my brain just can't stop working sometimes ghost train. What are the serious ramifications for?
 Don't do drugs kids by the way. Um ghost trains
 What would be the serious ramifications if it if the oh my god, it's blowing my mind
 If the train was never there
 But there's a ghost of a train if we accept those two things as facts
 Then you also have to extrapolate that to say that every ghost or a good likely amount of ghosts that we see
 Are not tied to that physical location. Our linear timeline is looking at a ghost and saying I know Mary queen of scots died here
 Therefore that ghost looks like Mary queen of scots. However, that ghost could be a cosplayer
 From 80 years in the future who died wearing her mary queen of scott uniform. Bam, dude
 I just answered every ghost sighting ever. You can thank me later. Don't do drugs kids. Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story
 Okay, now we're going to go to
 Croatia now
 If you want to go quickly, there's only one way to get there. It's all cleaned out, baby
 We got the carboner copter hop on in
 Isn't it nice through and I got it. It's all clean. I got all these air fresheners cut the doors wide open
 So hold on to something
 If you don't get the reference a bunch of people pooped in it a couple episodes ago
 We're in Croatia. We also had to go back in time during our flight
 We are going to watch the life and times of a man. Tell me this doesn't sound like a star trek character
 I said I wasn't going to do any star trek jokes, but this guy sounds like a star trek character
 His name is frayne selec
 Don't fool me. That's a star trek character. You're a time traveler, but anyways, we land
 In frayne selecs yard and he's like get out of here your kids in your wacky contraption because we're back in
 Oh, I guess they had helicopters back in 1962. He's like get out of here kids with your contraption that I'm vaguely aware of
 He's shaking a pitchfork at it. Actually frayne seems to be a pretty nice guy. So he's like, I'm just kidding
 Come on in. Let's hang out for a bit. We don't really want to hang out with him
 Now if you haven't seen the movie final destination, it's the movie where death tries to kill you
 You escape and I love final destination 4. That's one of my favorite movies
 The series is good, but final destination 4 called the final destination is one of the bests
 One of the best horror movies. Absolutely love it. But anyways, that's the setup for those movies
 You escape death and then death tries to get you again until you eventually die
 Let's look at frayne selecs life
 First off, he was a romulan officer on a warbird. No, I'm just joking. Okay. Okay in 1962
 He was in a train
 Another train no ghost hobos nothing like that the train however flips off the tracks crashes into the river
 17 people drown. He swims the shore one year later 1963
 He's flying in a plane the door of the plane
 Malfunctions pops open. He is thrown out of the plane. I don't know what height but not super high
 He's thrown out of the plane. He lands in a haystack plane crashes killing 19 people
 He never flew on another plane three years after that. He was in a bus
 Slid off the road into the river. He swims the shore four people drown four years later. So now we're in 1970
 He's rocking the bell bottoms harry chest huge medallion. He's driving a car
 Car catches on fire. He jumps out of his car and gets away before the car explodes three years later 1973 drive in a car
 A malfunctioning fuel a lot of malfunctions a malfunctioning fuel pump begins leaking hot oil onto his engine
 Flame shoots out of his heater vents into his car burns his hair off
 But he survives and then nothing until 1995
 He gets hit by a bus
 minor injuries
 One year later this I think all of that's bad, but this I thought was quite chilling
 1996 he's driving on a curvy mountain road
 And a united nation's truck comes out of relatively nowhere and now they're about to have a head-on collision
 He swerves into the guard rail to avoid the truck the guard rail gives away
 Now because when he swerved the impact of the car
 He wasn't wearing his seatbelt and when his car hit his door swung open
 He flew out of his car grabbed onto a tree
 Car plummets down a 300 foot gorge and he's just standing there
 All of these had been documented throughout his life the you and truck I hope stopped and helped them
 They're like no we only help nations not just you
 But anyways fraying selec
 survived death multiple times
 2003 two days after his 73rd birthday wins a million dollars in the lottery
 buys much houses buys a boat gives a rest to his friends and family
 Died peacefully 89 years old. Can you imagine dodging death that many times in your life?
 Like I mean at a sur after okay
 I've had some pretty scary run-ins with like car accidents and like sketchy situations in places
 I shouldn't have been things like that but after the fourth time I got in a vehicle and it either exploded or drove off the road
 I I'd be like i'm done. Actually, that's kind of what I have done
 I've been in seven car accidents and I'm like I don't need to drive. I'll just walk everywhere
 So like yeah, I mean, but this guy's like oh my my car blew up
 Good thing it's fully insured time to buy another car and it catches on fire
 I don't know crazy, but luckiest or unluckiest man
 I mean it's pretty lucky to win a million dollars
 But it'd be even more lucky if he won a million dollars when he was younger
 But he had it and he said you know his his view was I bought what he wanted and then he's like
 I'll just give the rest of my family and kids luckiest or unluckiest man
 You decide I guess luckiest really because he survived the whole time
 I found that story when I was looking up the farthest falls
 He was listed as one of the people who survived the plain fold
 But I mean he fell into a pile of hay like a loonatoon character
 He doesn't even see how high the plane was
 But I thought I was like oh this this guy needs to just get his own little segment
 But let's go ahead. Okay, so we're gonna say buy to frame
 Buy frame sell like he's like buy and then we notice he talks into his calm and he's like
 Let the tal shia know that the romulan's well. He's a star trek character
 It's a star trek name
 But anyways, we'll leave the star trek romulan infiltrator behind
 But we hop into the carpenter copter
 We're on our way to Hollywood the land of glitz and glamour
 Everything's beautiful in Hollywood everything's I have a friend who went to Hollywood to be an actor
 And I go how are the women down there and he looks at me like I'm an idiot
 He's like, how do you think dude? They're all gorgeous. I was like, yeah
 I guess that was kind of a self answering question
 But anyway, so hey, Jonas if you listen to the show so we
 Are in the carpenter copter now we do have to make a quick stop
 I got to get some ampm hamburgers because I love those gas station burgers
 Oh, wait. I'm on keto. Damn it. Ah, I just have to fly over the amp. I'm gonna be like, uh, damn it
 We fly over
 But we got to be careful we're gonna put on stealth mode
 Not super stealthy
 But because we know
 The cia is listening to a very intriguing phone call
 Marilyn Monroe famous movie actress
 Singer I think I think she was in some musicals
 She had been sleeping with
 Both the president of the united states and his brother
 Attorney general robert kennedy. I don't think I could share a woman with my brother
 Maybe maryland Monroe
 But I don't think so so anyways or british fierce, but no, that's gross dude
 They'd be getting all dna mixed up and stuff in there. Anyway, so
 That that aside that aside maryland roe was sleeping with both president kennedy and
 Attorney general bobby kennedy
 But they had kind of ghosted her at this point. They were like, no, I wouldn't want to talk to you anymore
 And she was starting to lose her luster in hollywood
 Marilyn Monroe was no longer the big star that she had used to be
 august 3rd
 1962
 There was a phone call that the cia recorded because cia had maryland Monroe's phone tapped
 Because they knew she knew stuff about the president kennedy and
 Robert kennedy
 And they had the phones tapped of maryland roe's friends now
 That's the thing whenever people talk about conspiracies and they're like, well, you know
 That's not true that we find bits and pieces of true conspiracies here and there
 There's the conspiracy that maryland roe didn't commit suicide that she was murdered people are like what no
 There's no way she had all these drugs in her system only people who commit suicide do that
 There's no assassin wouldn't make you take drugs
 But then we have recordings of phone call. We know her phone was being tapped in this wiretap
 Which was found during a freedom of information act request
 It is regarding a conversation between a reporter dorthy killigan
 Sorry, not killigan dorthy kill glenn and her close friend, howard rothberg
 And I believe that when they're saying her close friend, they're referring to maryland roe's close friend
 Government talk isn't always the most specific. I'm going to read this to you. This is an actual cia document
 Rothberg discussed the apparent comeback of subject with maryland roe with kill glenn and the breakup with the kinities
 Rothberg told kill glenn that she was attending hollywood parties hosted by quote-unquote
 Inner circle among hollywood's elite and was becoming the talk of the town again
 Rothberg indicated in so many words that she has secrets to tell no doubt arising from her trists with the president and the attorney general
 One such secret and what's weird secrets and air quotes secrets and quotations there
 One such quote-unquote secret mentions the visit by the president
 So before I get on the next part the cia is listening in on this phone call and maryland roe's friend is talking to a reporter
 And he's like yeah, you know, she's she's making the rounds in hollywood. She's really trying to get herself back out there
 She's talking to the high and mighty the elite in hollywood. She's trying to get back into show business
 Cia agents like, you know, listen into it. This is the next part that comes out and this is what the cia agent typed up
 This is their official report one such secret mentions the visit by the president at a secret airbase for the purpose of inspecting things from outer space
 Kill glenn replied that she knew what might be the source of visit in the mid fifties kill glenn learned of secret effort by us and uk governments to
 identify the origins of crash spacecraft and dead bodies from a british government official
 Kill glenn believed the story may have come from the new mexico story in the late forties
 Kill glenn said if the story is true
 It would cause terrible embarrassment for jack and his plans to have nasa put men on the moon
 So you have this conversation between maryland roe's friend saying hey, she wants to get back into show business
 Yeah, she also told me this weird story how the president went out to some secret base and
 To go look at stuff from outer space and the reporter goes
 Hmm. I kind of I know a little bit something about that
 I talked to a british official a couple years ago back in the fifties
 And he told me that we have been in contact with a small race of beans
 And we believe that they crashed at some place in new mexico. I don't remember and
 We're worried that they may be some sort of
 problem
 Dorothy kill glenn is a reporter, but she's known as a gossip columnist as well
 She reported the findings of the ufo of the british guy
 That was from back in the
 So that story that she had written
 Was from 1955 so it was a good seven years before this meeting
 She had written up in this gossip column basically saying that
 The british government has encountered a ufo. They don't know what it is
 They actually have the wreckage and they know the body's like they're a little they're little tiny people and all that stuff
 Stuff that we commonly know as grace now. There's two separate statements
 One is someone who's close to marylandman row saying marylandman row says that the president said he went to a base and
 Went to go see things from outer space and then the reporter interjects. Oh, I know what you're talking about
 I know a guy who who believes aliens are here
 She never named the name of the british official, which I mean can be a sign of deception or it can also be a sign
 of the guy doesn't want to be called a kook
 so
 What in the world are we supposed to glean from this cia document?
 if there's so much weird stuff in this because
 If jfk is willing to tell
 marylandman row about the secret trip and if he did see aliens
 She would know that as well. She would she would have revealed that to her friend or would she
 Kilgill in who did do a story on aliens back in the 50s talking to an unnamed british official
 She kind of threw in her own two cents, but even if we knew that there was aliens out there
 Why would she make the final phrase it would cause a terrible embarrassment for jackness plans to have nasa put men on the moon
 Why would would it be embarrassing because our technology was so limited?
 Would it be embarrassing because it wouldn't work because the aliens would destroy it now at this time?
 Yuri gargan has already floated around space like russians have already launched the first man's space capsule
 He orbited and came down normally
 There was a theory that jfk visiting the objects from outer space
 Was actually remains of soviet technology that has shot up into space and fell down
 I don't really know if that washes with this
 Because that would also be something marillon row be like if jfk told marylandman row this stuff
 She could say yeah, he went and saw some space junk from the russkies and but it's so vague
 To see things from outer space and to make it even more puzzling. This isn't the whole report
 There's a single page from the cia that includes that story
 And then phone taps from marillon row's own phone where she was calling up
 bobby kennedy calling up jfk's brother. This is what again, it's it's not the exact transcript. It's what the cia notes say
 marillon row repeatedly called the attorney general and complained about the way she was being ignored by the president and his brother
 Marillon row threatened to hold a press conference and would tell all
 Marillon row made reference to bases in cuba and knew of the president's plan to kill castro
 Marillon row made reference to her diary of secrets and what the newspaper would do with such disclosures
 Now it makes sense that they don't say exactly what that is because the cia doesn't want to put that information
 It's information that they know and they don't want to put it in a report
 two days after that
 memo was created
 marillon row was found dead
 suicide drug overdose
 again
 If the cia was completely covering up the existence of ufo's that would they have included that first part in the document?
 They could have redacted it so we would have never seen it
 The fact that they leave in the part about the bases and the plot to kill castro
 We know about that so it makes sense that that part wasn't redacted
 I mean it's a mind boggler because you have this document that really makes it look like
 She was ready to release all this information
 We don't know what it is
 We can assume that when she says she's going to tell all that it relates to
 UFOs and et's and all this stuff or it could just be i'm going to tell me have a tiny dick
 We don't know exactly what the conversation was and what she was threatening to reveal
 I think just this document alone makes it look like she was murdered to cover up her from blabbing her mouth and pro tip
 Don't run your mouth and second pro tip if you're going to don't tell anyone you're going to
 Ever because this is what happens
 But her threatening we hear her words to bobby kennedy saying this is what i'm going to do this for other second conversation
 Is all hearsay it's two people repeating what another person has been told
 Did marillon row know about the ufo's?
 Did was marillon min row killed to cover up something and possibly that's something being alien life
 There's a third possibility
 That this document is fake
 We don't really have a provenance on the
 ci
 Document it's turned up in someone else's collection. I believe you can order it yourself
 But until I do I can't say for sure that it's 100 accurate, but other people have vouched for it
 I mean, you know ufo allegis, so I don't you know take it with a grain of salt
 They're saying that the cia is never specifically denied that this document is fake
 And it was this weird thing where someone said I want the actual transcripts released and the answer was kind of like
 Well, you already have that so in a roundabout way and I'm really like shortening the little legal battle that went on but
 In a roundabout way, it's been confirmed to be accurate
 But we don't know
 It could easily be a forgery. I did read an interesting thing and they said this guy goes
 I've read a lot of forgeries in my life about ufo stuff and he goes normally he goes if this was a forgery
 This is how I think they would have done it
 They would have said marillon min row said that she saw aliens and she saw a flying disc and they always hype it up
 When you're making a forgery for the ufo community you make it even more hype
 And make it really like throw some green men. Yeah, yeah, put the pleidians in there like they make it more
 And he goes this one's actually doesn't seem like a hoax just because it's so down to earth
 It's very vague. He goes they never actually even really use the word alien or ufo in it
 If it's real if this is a real document
 That's really creepy
 These phone calls are being recorded two days before she dies
 That's you know, that's a really big coincidence
 But who knows
 Yeah, I always thought that marillon min row. I always figured marillon min row was killed honestly
 That's a conspiracy theory. I believe and that she didn't commit suicide
 I've always believed in that
 But I always thought she got killed because she knew too much or she got too deep in the mob or
 Something like that. I I never would have thought she knew anything about flying saucers
 But according to this document if it's real she knew something and what she knew
 May have sent her to the grave
