00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 Be careful who you're getting your savory treats from, especially if you live in Eastern Europe.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,900
 And then we take a look at the story of Carl Higdon out on a nice day trying to shoot some elk in the brain.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:25,200
 But when he pulls that trigger and the bullet stops in midair, he realizes that maybe he's the one being hunted today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,100
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Had a bit of a skier here though. Had an equipment failure.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,600
 One of my mic cables went out. Gotta buy some new ones.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,100
 So, um, we almost basically have canceled the show. I don't have a lot of extra cables laying around.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,700
 So I'm gonna have to buy some. And speaking of buying stuff, if you want to help support the show, you can support the show via Patreon, like my latest Patreon.

10
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,500
 TehshanaV. TehshanaV, thank you so much for supporting the show. It means a lot.

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,800
 But for those of you who can't support the Patreon, just get the word out. That helps a lot too. Word of mouth really helps the show grow.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:24,000
 And let's go ahead and move on with the first story. I'm gonna order some more cables, backup cables, and I hope this cable is sounding good. I don't know.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,800
 I don't know. But anyways, it will do on a pinch. Let's go ahead and get started with the first story here. We'll figure out the cable stuff later.

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 Now on Monday's episode, I talked about haunted dolls. And I said the difference between a haunted doll and a haunted house, other than the fact that one you can live in,

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,600
 and get chased around and take Scooby-Doo to, and the other one is three feet tall. Three feet tall. That's a giant doll. Ten inches tall.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:58,500
 Anyways, I said because the stories of haunted houses tend to be neighborhood stories, generational stories. You grow up in the area, you tell your kids, "Oh yeah, that house is haunted."

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,700
 Because you're a cruel parent and you want your kids to live in fear. Haunted dolls though are generally much more limited to the family.

18
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,600
 And they don't tend to be passed down from generation to generation. It's kind of like, "Oh, your sister has a doll. It's super spooky."

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:22,500
 When I was using examples to kind of make my point there, I just came up with something off the top of my head and I said, "This incident is a story you would hear in your neighborhood."

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,600
 And then the next day, I found that exact example that I thought I had really just made up in the news.

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:38,300
 Let's go ahead and we're going to, let's hop in the Carbentercopter. Get it all warmed up. Check in the cables. Make sure the cables work.

22
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,800
 And they do. You're like, "JC, you didn't check all the cables. What about that bunch of..." Ah, no, no, they're fine. Those are totally fine.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 So I'm getting in the copter. I'm like, "You coming?" And you're like, "Uh..."

24
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,300
 "Can I check the cables?" No, no, just kidding. We don't have time. We don't have time.

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,800
 Hop in the Carbentercopter. We take off a little more slowly than usual. You're like, "Uh..."

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
 We're going to Khabarovsk, Russia.

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
 [JC imitates car engine]

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 Your stomach, your stomach dropped a bit. Like, "Nah, nah, it's totally fine. It always makes that noise." You're like, "You know, it doesn't, Jason."

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 Anyways, we're going to Khabarovsk, Russia.

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,300
 And we land and then I'm like, "There's your house." And you're like, "What? I don't live here. I live in..."

31
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,300
 You're supposed to state your city when there's the pause there. But anyways, I don't know whether or not you'll do that.

32
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,800
 I go, "No, bro. That's your house. Go home. Go in there." I don't want you anymore. Go home, Harry.

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,300
 We don't need you. So you're all walking away all super slow.

34
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
 [JC imitates car engine]

35
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
 Big ol' Sasquatch. And you walk into the door.

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 So, you have a bunch of kids now. You're like, "This is a trippy episode. All these kids are running around here."

37
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,300
 "This is a super convoluted way to start this story up." You have a bunch of kids and they're like...

38
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,800
 "Parent, parent!" Because I don't know if you're a boy or girl. "Parent!"

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:02,300
 Look at what we got from the old lady down the street. And they're bringing you this stuff called ASPIC.

40
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,300
 Now, I have to take a moment to explain what this is, unless you're listening to this in Eastern Europe.

41
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
 Because right now, you're probably grabbing your fork and your knife. You're like, "Mmm, ASPIC. Yummy."

42
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:18,300
 It's called different things in different regions, but for the rest of the world, what it is, this is so disgusting.

43
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,300
 Here, I'll read you the actual, like, description from Wikipedia, and then I'll have to break it down for you.

44
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,800
 This is very, very important for this story. ASPIC. ASPIC is how it's spelled.

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 "A savory jelly made with meat stock set in a mold and used to contain pieces of meat, seafood, or eggs."

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,300
 So it's meat jello. Now, I get that jello is made out of gelatin, which are like horse hooves and stuff like that, collagen.

47
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,800
 And that's fine, whatever. It's disgusting, but this is...

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:58,300
 throw a bunch of bones into the water, and all this fat and chemistry stuff gets separated, and you basically make a gelatin out of beef stock.

49
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
 And you're like, "That's fine. That's how Nor-- You know, let me finish, bro. You know, let me finish."

50
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:10,300
 And in most parts of the civilized world, you would then take the jello and put some, like, I don't know, peaches, like, cut up a peach and throw it in there,

51
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:17,300
 pineapple, throw it in there. You'd have a jello mold. You'd have a jello with little pieces of fruit in there, and you'd eat it.

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:29,800
 But in places of the world where fruit doesn't grow, i.e., Eastern Europe, they have no fruit trees, they put chunks of meat in their jello.

53
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 So you would have this jello mold, and then there'd be like a hot dog floating around in it, and you're like, "Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Yummy, yummy, yummy."

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:47,300
 I can't wait to eat with some ass pig. And apparently, I actually have a friend of mine who's Eastern European, relatively new to the United States.

55
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,800
 She's been here for about 19 years, so she spent half of her life in, like, Turempia or something like that.

56
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 And I asked her, I said, "Do you know what this is?" And she had to translate it to her region. She's like, "Oh, we call it this here?"

57
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,300
 She's like, "Yeah, my mom eats it all the time." When she came to visit me, stayed with me for about six months, she was making it.

58
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,800
 And I'm like, "Had you eaten?" And she's like, "No, it's super gross." Apparently, it tastes a little bit like gravy in meat, like meat.

59
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 Like, just, you know, pour gravy over meat. But there's pictures of this, and it's just a jello mold, and there'll be like squares of meat floating in it.

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 And kids are like, "I want to get the meaty part." "No, Billy, I'm getting in there like fighting over it, stabbing each other."

61
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:38,300
 So, that's what Aspic is. Disgusting, delicacy for millions of people, east of what was formerly known as the Iron Curtain.

62
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:45,300
 This story gets even grosser than that. That's not the story that people eat this stuff. That I'm like, an on-the-next story.

63
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,300
 So anyways, your kids are running around, they're like, "Parent, parent, we want some Aspic." And you're like pushing them away.

64
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,300
 You're like, "I don't even know what that is, man. I just got here. Just got here."

65
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,800
 And then my narration tells you, and you're like, "Oh, that's disgusting kids." You're not getting out of that stuff.

66
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,300
 And they're like, "Aww." But then they're like, "But Sophia gives us some."

67
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 Sophia gave us this right here, and they have a little handful of wobbly jello.

68
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,300
 There's a chicken wing in it, and you're like, "Ugh, you want some?" And you're like, "No."

69
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,300
 And we slap it out of their hand. So, they're getting it from Sophia Mikhailanov.

70
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,300
 Sophia Mikhailanov. And she's this old lady in town, and they really strike shoes odd, because she's kind of mean.

71
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
 So they describe her in news articles as "serily and unfriendly."

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,300
 And you're like, "Yeah, that is a good way to describe her. I would just describe her as a mean person. A mean woman."

73
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:46,300
 So, you find it odd that she's giving out treats to the kids, even though like she rarely ever talks to you, and she just seems kind of like a jerk.

74
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,300
 You're like, "Guys, I don't think it's a good idea to eat that stuff. I don't think you guys should be eating that."

75
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,300
 Awwww. And they're like looking at you with puppy-dog eyes.

76
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,300
 And then everything freeze-frames, and I walk into the scene, and I was like, "You made the right decision."

77
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 You're like, "I didn't know you had such magical powers." I'm like, "Yes, I do."

78
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,300
 I can freeze time to deliver this narration. Kids are still clutching at your pan legs. You can't move.

79
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,300
 You made the right decision. This is what--and then I snap my fingers and we're in the Matrix now.

80
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,300
 We're sitting in plush chairs in a white room, and there's television in front of us, and I go, "Television play the rest of this story. I'm just gonna take a nap."

81
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,300
 Television turns on. Totally convoluted way to tell this story. Anyways, now you're watching the TV.

82
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,300
 This is what happened. Sofia Mikhailov was this woman living in this town. This is a very, very recent news story.

83
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,300
 She's giving out these little pieces of ass pic to kids and to neighbors here. Have some of this.

84
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:49,300
 Some people ate it, some people didn't. Around the same time, the police are finding body parts and garbage cans in the region, in the area.

85
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,300
 I don't think she was going out 100 miles and dropping it off in, like, Kazakhstan's garbage can.

86
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,300
 But in the area they find--but I also don't think she was dropping them in her garbage can, so I'm just saying, like, in the general area,

87
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,300
 police start finding body parts, and they're like, "Hmm." And they get enough of the body parts. They're basically, like, recreating the sky.

88
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,300
 They're like, "If only we had the head." Then we would know who it was. But they start to kind of narrow it down, and they're like,

89
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,300
 "I think we know who this is. I think it was this guy who lived in Karbarosk with Sofia. He was like a lodger."

90
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
 I don't know--I don't know how they figured that out. I don't know if they were carrying, like, a leg around with a pant leg on it,

91
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,300
 and they're like, "Have you seen this guy?" And everyone's like, "Oh, no, I know that. That's Buddy's pants."

92
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,300
 But anyways, they go to her house, knock on the door, open it up. She's like, "Would you like some ass pic?"

93
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,300
 They're like, "Yeah." And they start eating it, and they're like, "Okay, that's enough." They start looking around.

94
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,300
 They find body parts in her fridge, specifically the grossest body part, the intestines.

95
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,300
 So they're like, "Did you really eat that ass pic?" And the rookie's like, "Oh, yeah. You got--you sure more in the fridge?"

96
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,300
 And he looks at it, "Bleh." So what she was doing was--here's the point of contention.

97
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 People in town say that the police have told them, off the record, that she was killed the lodger and cut up parts of his body

98
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 and made it into ass pic and then gave it to the people in town. The police are saying, "We will not confirm or deny that."

99
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 We're not gonna confirm or deny that. But people in town say, "I know this cop," and he actually told me that, yes.

100
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 So she's currently arrested. They actually are charging her with three murders.

101
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:32,300
 The murder of this lodger, the murder of one of her good friends who came to live with her, and the murder of a eight-year-old girl, like, six, seven years ago.

102
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,300
 So obviously the question is, has she been feeding people ass--like, was she making gelatin food that long ago?

103
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,300
 Is it a recent thing? Did she just say, "This adult male is the biggest victim I've ever killed."

104
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,300
 "I gotta figure out a way to get rid of these people." Chop 'em up. Or was she doing it with the kid, too? We don't know.

105
00:10:51,300 --> 00:11:01,300
 This is super recent. On my Ghost All episode, I said, "You know, you'd have a story about the haunted house, and there's an old woman there who, like, chops up a trick-or-treater and hands it out to other trick-or-treaters."

106
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:11,300
 Just as a ridiculous story, you would tell your little brother. And then the next day I read that in the newspaper, gross.

107
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:19,300
 Gross. And the dessert's gross in and of itself. Moral of the story is, don't eat meat in jello.

108
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:26,300
 Second moral of the story is, don't accept stuff from people who are referred to as "serly and unfriendly."

109
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,300
 So anyways, that is that story that sprung out of my mind as a joke and became real.

110
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 Let's go ahead--and I missed this yesterday, but yesterday's episode was, like, an hour and a half, and I had to take out a ton of stuff just to get it to where it was at.

111
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,300
 Let's do a very quick Dead Rabbit Recommends here.

112
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:53,300
 The next one is one I've been sitting on for a while, and I really can't talk about it much, because there's so many possible spoilers in it.

113
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 But it is--when I was watching the movie, I thought, "This movie is perfect for Dead Rabbit Radio audience." 100% perfect.

114
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:14,300
 It's a movie called "Under the Silver Lake," and it's the story of a young man in Hollywood who uncovers a conspiracy.

115
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
 And that's really all you can really talk about the plot.

116
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,300
 It's--I loved it. I absolutely loved the movie.

117
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 It has multiple mysteries. It keeps you guessing. It's very filmed, noirish.

118
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,300
 It was directed by the guy who does "It Follows," which I did not like that movie.

119
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:40,300
 And I was maybe a good hour into the movie, and I'm watching, and I go, "Oh my God, that's Andrew Garfield."

120
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:47,300
 And he's the star. He's in almost every scene of the movie. Totally dissolves into the role.

121
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 Like, I didn't--you might recognize him more, but I didn't recognize him at all.

122
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 There's one particular scene, and I was like, "Oh my God, that's Spider-Man. Like, he does a great job in the movie."

123
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,300
 The movie is one big puzzle, and a lot of internet people have tried saying--trying to, like, interpret it their own way.

124
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,300
 And I try not to get lost. That's what happened to me with the Joker, too.

125
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:12,300
 Like, I was doing research on the Joker, and I was reading all this stuff, and I--I step back and I go, "I just like my interpretation."

126
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,300
 And that's what I would recommend with "Under the Silver Lake." Just watch it, and if you have some serious questions you need answered,

127
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:23,300
 maybe go online, but you just watch it and then you walk away. And it's a really, really compelling mystery.

128
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,300
 And it's dope. Like, all of the little clues--it's not like, "Hmm, who stole the ketchup?"

129
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 It's a mystery like the Illuminati Controlling or some sort of group controlling Hollywood.

130
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,300
 So it's not this little thing. It's actually like him trying--it's this normal guy who just bangs hot girls.

131
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,300
 All of a sudden, it goes, you know, knee deep in this crazy conspiracy.

132
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,300
 Really, really good movie, and it's full of hot women, too, so.

133
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,300
 "Dead Rabbit" recommends "Under the Silver Lake." Again, it's not a party movie.

134
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,300
 It's a movie you kind of want to sit down and watch, but I really, really enjoy that movie.

135
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story, though.

136
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:09,300
 Our next story, we are back in the Carbenter Copter. We are headed to Medicine Bow National Forest.

137
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
 So we're flying over Medicine Bow National Forest. Birds everywhere.

138
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
 [whining]

139
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 Squirrels.

140
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
 [smacking]

141
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 Wind blown through the trees, and then you hear a "Want, want, want!" as I'm trying to regain control of the Carbenter Copter.

142
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
 It's smoking out the back.

143
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 "Hold on!" You're like, "There's nothing hold on to!"

144
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,300
 [mimicking gunshots]

145
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
 Rotorblade breaks off, we're outrunning the rotorblade.

146
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
 [screaming]

147
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
 [explosion]

148
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
 Massive fireball.

149
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
 [heavy breathing]

150
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
 It's covered in soot.

151
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,300
 You're like, "Is that the end of the Carbenter Copter?" "No, no, we'll fix it."

152
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
 But, we almost died.

153
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 So just taking a breath of fresh air, look at the sun, and thank God you're still alive.

154
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 And we do that, and we just kind of go, "Ah, good thing we're alive."

155
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
 Raging forest fire behind us.

156
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:08,300
 It's October 25th, 1975, I believe. 1975. We're in Wyoming.

157
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,300
 Now we're outrunning the forest fire. We're running in slow motion, huge fire behind us.

158
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 We start running in real motion, and we totally get away from it.

159
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,300
 And we run into a guy named Carl Higdon, 41-year-old dude.

160
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 He's normally an oil driller, not the drill itself. He just works at one.

161
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 And it's his day off.

162
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,300
 So what better way to spin your day off than to just shoot living things in the neck?

163
00:15:32,300 --> 00:16:02,300
 Watch him go, "Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

164
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,300
 And your sound effect goes backwards. He pulls the trigger, and there's no sound.

165
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:14,300
 The gun doesn't even kick back. What he does is he watches the bullet fly out in slow motion.

166
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 When it starts to slow down, even more, even more, even more, and then it just drops.

167
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,300
 About 20 feet away from him, 30 feet away from him, the forest is dead silent.

168
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300
 He's like, "What in the world just happened?"

169
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 Then he hears a twig snap behind him, and he spins around.

170
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,300
 Gun ready to go. Behind him is Osso.

171
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,300
 So Osso, or Osso1 as he's also known, is an alien.

172
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,300
 Not just any alien. This alien has some unique characteristics.

173
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
 He's not one of those wimpy little grays.

174
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,300
 Dude is six foot tall, at least. Big ol' massive dude.

175
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 Not as tall as me, but whatever.

176
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
 And he's just an all black. So he's one of those emo aliens.

177
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 He has his belt on. He's wearing this big ol' belt with a giant six pointed star and then a weird emblem in the middle.

178
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,300
 We've covered a lot of aliens like that. I think that's one of the interesting things.

179
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,300
 Grays are always these naked skinny little dudes that are running around.

180
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,300
 There's a ton of aliens out there and straight up like official uniforms with insignias and stuff like that.

181
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
 It's kind of bizarre that they very rarely get covered.

182
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
 He's standing there.

183
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
 No ears that are visible at least. Tiny little eyeballs.

184
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,300
 Normal sized head apparently, but he has Bart Simpson hair.

185
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 So he has what's described as straw like hair that goes straight up and sticking out of the hair are two antennas.

186
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,300
 So straight up alien looking dude. And if that's not enough, no hands.

187
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,300
 Carl says he's on this adventure with Osso and he goes, I never saw his hands.

188
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,300
 He goes on one arm. There's like this little drill bit looking thing.

189
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
 Mmm, that's interesting. I didn't think about that before.

190
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 But there's this little drill bit thing.

191
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:59,300
 And the reason why, because I'll forget to mention it later, I think it's weird that he's a driller and then the alien appeared that had a drilling device on its hand.

192
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,300
 It's a weird, it kind of makes me think the whole story is fake.

193
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,300
 All he can imagine stuff is drilling in the spaceship look like a giant drill.

194
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
 And then we went to planet hole drill went in.

195
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,300
 But anyways, alien has a drill for a hand and he's just standing in front of Carl and Carl standing there.

196
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
 And then the alien goes, how are you doing?

197
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,300
 Carl is like, that's actual quote by the way.

198
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,300
 Carl is like, I'm actually kind of nervous. That's not an actual quote, but he was kind of nervous.

199
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,300
 He said he was nervous and the alien's like, God, don't worry about it, man. I got you.

200
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:39,300
 You look a little hungry and the alien waves his little drill hand and a box of pills starts floating in midair.

201
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
 He started floating towards Carl.

202
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,300
 Totally true. According to Carl, this is what happened. I'm not eating up to a joke.

203
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,300
 Little box of pills floats to the air, lands in Carl's hand and the alien goes, you should eat one of those pills.

204
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 You look hungry, eat one of those pills and it will fill you up for four days.

205
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
 You won't have to eat for four days.

206
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,300
 Now, what would you do if an alien, I would take the pill?

207
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,300
 If an alien's like here, this pill will do whatever.

208
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 I'd be like, it doesn't even have to do anything.

209
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
 Pill from an alien, I'm sold.

210
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
 And Carl also takes the pill.

211
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,300
 Now, the alien goes, oh, good. We tricked you. Sky turned dark.

212
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 Now he goes, thank you. Thank you for taking that pill. You can keep the rest of them.

213
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,300
 He's like, and then he goes, hey, Carl, I know we just met and I know you just took that mystery pill.

214
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,300
 You want to go back to my place? You want to come visit my home planet, I meant to say?

215
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 Now, Carl has said that he was fascinated by aliens and UFOs and he had told people, well, if I ever meet an alien, I'll hang out with him.

216
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 I will talk to him. I'm not scared of aliens.

217
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,300
 But in this case, he actually was like, yeah, I'll go home with you.

218
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 So bizarre. I might say the same thing. I probably would.

219
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 But it's a difference between taking a pill that an alien gives you. That's pretty trusting.

220
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
 But then his home planet is totally different.

221
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 But anyway, so Carl says, yeah, dude, I'll go home with you.

222
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
 And I've never done that before, but you look kind of cute.

223
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
 And the alien's like, starts blushing.

224
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 It's time for a new beginning for both of us.

225
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,300
 He grabs the drill hand and it's like, no.

226
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
 Anyways, it's weirder than that.

227
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,300
 A box appears or Carl appears in a box that he describes as a seven by seven box,

228
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:28,300
 which I'm assuming is seven by seven feet, but it seems like it would have to be seven by seven hundred yards because he's in the box with also one,

229
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 two other aliens and five elk and the box flies away.

230
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 And he describes it going up to something like the Space Needle in Seattle,

231
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
 which actually kind of looks like a drill. It has a point.

232
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:54,300
 Anyways, and from there they travel, depending on the article, either 163,000 light years, 163,000 light miles, or 163,000 miles.

233
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
 Huge difference between those.

234
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
 Anyways, he ends up on Osso's home planet.

235
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
 And so they're talking.

236
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
 Like, so why do you come to Earth?

237
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 And Osso goes, well, we don't have wildlife on our planet.

238
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,300
 Here, look, and he opens the door and it's just, he doesn't really describe the planet, but it's a like city, apparently.

239
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
 And he goes, we don't have any wildlife here.

240
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,300
 So we'll come to your planet to take wildlife.

241
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 And some people have said maybe that explains catamethylations, but no, because catamethylations, they just take the eyeball in the tongue and the genitals in the blood,

242
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,300
 everything that a normal predator does on planet Earth.

243
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
 But anyways, that doesn't explain catamethylations.

244
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
 They say we bring animals up here and Osso's like, I love fish so much.

245
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
 Sometimes they just go down to Earth just to get some fish.

246
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
 My favorite thing down there.

247
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
 Now, while Carl is up there walking around, he sees other humans chilling.

248
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
 And Osso's like, it's pretty cool, huh?

249
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 We got other people up here and Carl's like, yeah, it's kind of cool.

250
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
 A little creepy, a little weird.

251
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
 These people also come visit.

252
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 And Osso's like, yeah, yeah, we asked, we didn't take them on purpose.

253
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
 We asked them if they want to come up here.

254
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,300
 And then Osso goes here, step in front of this device.

255
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 And it's like this window mirror type thing.

256
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 And it goes, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, boob

257
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 And it goes booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo, booboo,

258
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 And then Carl appears back on Earth.

259
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 Now, he's not where he was taken from.

260
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,300
 And he had parked his truck, went hiking to go hunt elk.

261
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
 And then all this happened.

262
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
 When he reappears, he reappears pretty close to his truck.

263
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300
 So him and his truck are nowhere near where they were on Earth.

264
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,300
 And like for whatever reason, the aliens teleport him right on the edge of a goalie.

265
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,300
 And he falls down a steep hill and hits his head on a rock.

266
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 He finally wakes up.

267
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
 He gets a little knocked out.

268
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300
 He wakes up, he doesn't know where he's at.

269
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
 He has no idea what's going on.

270
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:21,300
 He climbs up the rocks, gets to his car, and there's like a work radio, like a CB radio.

271
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300
 And he's like, I need help.

272
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
 I don't know where I'm at.

273
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
 My truck, my head.

274
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,300
 Also.

275
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 And so the rescue crew is like, uh-oh, there's something going on out there.

276
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,300
 Rescue crew goes out there looking for him, because they don't know where he's at.

277
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,300
 They just know that this guy is lost somewhere in the woods.

278
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
 Rescue crews follow him in the road.

279
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
 They know he had a truck.

280
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
 Can't find the truck.

281
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
 They start stomping through the forest.

282
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
 They see the truck and they're like, how did the truck even get out here?

283
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
 There's no tire tracks to lead out here, nothing.

284
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 The wife ends up joining the search party, because they call her up and they're like, hey, ma'am, we found your husband.

285
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
 Come on down.

286
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
 So she comes down there, right?

287
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 And he's just all, uh, he's all just like bashed up.

288
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
 And here's her, I love this quote.

289
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 Here's her quote from the newspaper.

290
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:15,300
 "When I first saw Carl, he was obviously in a state of panic and unable to say a word.

291
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
 Only after I asked him if he got any elk.

292
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
 That's her, that's her concern.

293
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
 Did you get elk?

294
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
 I'm so hungry for elk."

295
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,300
 Her husband's all like laying in a car bleeding from the head.

296
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
 So where's the elk?

297
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:32,300
 Only after I asked him if he got any elk, did he come alive and start looking out the windshield up in the sky.

298
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 With this, he began shouting, they took my elk.

299
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
 His face looked so strange.

300
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,300
 It scared me and I told one of the sheriff deputies to get his rifle and take it out of the pickup and out of his reach.

301
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 I wasn't sure what he would do.

302
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,300
 All the while, Carl kept telling me not to touch him.

303
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,300
 Finally, I got my coat around his shoulders and we drove to the Carbon County Memorial Hospital.

304
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
 That sounds like a boring place, Carbon County.

305
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 At the hospital, my husband kept talking wildly, making no sense.

306
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 They took my elk.

307
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 Where are the pills?

308
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
 The lights, they hurt.

309
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
 The pickup is gone.

310
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
 They pointed the gun and it's gone.

311
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,300
 So those are all actual quotes, other than me commenting on that gross county name.

312
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,300
 Those are all actual quotes from the wife saying that's what he was talking about.

313
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
 He was rambling about in the hospital and at the scene.

314
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
 They took my elk.

315
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
 Where are the pills?

316
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,300
 Which is an interesting question because I was wondering that too.

317
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
 Where are the pills?

318
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,300
 He knows that he should have them.

319
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
 They're gone.

320
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 The light, they hurt.

321
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 He mentioned that in a couple other encounters that it was so bright up there.

322
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 I was certain his eyes actually had a turn down the light in the UFO.

323
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,300
 But anyway, so he stuck to this story for quite a long time.

324
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
 This is a really interesting one.

325
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,300
 A lot of people have covered it, but on Reddit, someone actually linked to some news articles.

326
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,300
 So I was able to actually read the original news articles from 1975.

327
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
 So that was really cool.

328
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,300
 Like that quote, straight from an article written.

329
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
 Let's see where that was written at here.

330
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
 Weekly World News, and I'm just joking.

331
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,300
 It was written in the, it was a real newspaper, the San Antonio Star.

332
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 So kind of weird, kind of weird, legit news source telling this story.

333
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
 But you know, everyone likes a little alien story now, man.

334
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 So eventually he gets better.

335
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
 He goes back.

336
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,300
 He shows people where this all started.

337
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
 They find the bullet.

338
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:30,300
 Which people are saying that should have been very, very difficult because, you know, bullets tend to go far and fast.

339
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 But he's like, nope, there it is.

340
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,300
 Like, this is where I stand and it only went like 30 feet in front of me.

341
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
 It's going to be right up.

342
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
 Yeah, here it is.

343
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,300
 And it was described as it looked like it was turned inside out.

344
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,300
 Like the lead slug was missing, but like the casing.

345
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 I'm not a big bullet person.

346
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,300
 But apparently the little lead part was missing, but the rest of it was like shredded.

347
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 And people were saying it doesn't look like it hit a solid object.

348
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 It looks like it was basically peeled back.

349
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
 And that's kind of where the story's at.

350
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
 Like he says that it was true.

351
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 He says that it's true.

352
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,300
 But there's not much evidence other than the bullet that it actually happened.

353
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
 He has this description.

354
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
 I guess they could probably count all the elk and be like, that's weird.

355
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 Five elk are missing.

356
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
 But other than that, there's not much proof.

357
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 Some people have tried looking up other missing people in the area and go, oh, maybe those are the missing people on the planet.

358
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 Maybe.

359
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 But I did find this one really weird source.

360
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
 And it was from this place called the Real News.

361
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,300
 It was like a text file.

362
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
 It was an old, old source.

363
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 And I never thought about this before.

364
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 And we're going to end this like this.

365
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 There was a guy interviewing Carl and he goes, you know, you're describing the clothes like the black uniform.

366
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,300
 What did the back of the uniform look like?

367
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
 And Carl's been on this huge adventure.

368
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 He's walking around an alien planet.

369
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 He gets in the UFO, all this stuff.

370
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,300
 He spent like, I think he assumes he spent like two hours.

371
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:58,300
 A lot of these details about the other planet came out of hypnosis, but he thinks he spent about two hours with this alien.

372
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,300
 So they go, what did the back of the clothes look like?

373
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
 And there's a real interview.

374
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
 Carl's sitting there and he goes, what?

375
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 Whoa, now that you say that, I never saw their back.

376
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,300
 I never saw the back of them.

377
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 Now, the article goes on to say it's kind of weird that the interviewer didn't ask a follow-up question of that.

378
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,300
 If you spent two hours with somebody, you're going to see their back at least once.

379
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:32,300
 And then you start to think about how much when people are describing aliens, they're always describing the front of them.

380
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
 Like, does a gray, what does a gray's back look like?

381
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 Is it like super muscular?

382
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,300
 Is it really kind of lean and doughy?

383
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 What do the butts look like?

384
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
 Are they toned or are they kind of droopy?

385
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
 Do they have a butt?

386
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,300
 Very rarely do people describe aliens from the back.

387
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
 They never see their backs, really.

388
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,300
 So this guy could have had a star map on his back or a little tiny cape or another emblem.

389
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 Think about all the times I've talked about aliens on this show.

390
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,300
 People are always describing how they look from the front.

391
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
 Really bizarre.

392
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,300
 Because generally we'll go, oh yeah, no, she had a ponytail, no, she had long hair, no.

393
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,300
 You know, like, we do look at the backs of people.

394
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,300
 So the real news put this forth.

395
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,300
 When we look at old legends, there are like the stories of dwarves apparently.

396
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
 They could never let people see their backs because they were misshapen.

397
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,300
 They'd always have to face you as like a thing, the dwarves hid.

398
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:31,300
 What's weird is that not seeing the backs, that could be a minor detail that people just, the back is just the back.

399
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,300
 If someone said, hey, can you describe your significant other unless they're Nicki Minaj or Kim Kardashian,

400
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
 you're just going to explain what they look like from the front.

401
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 You're not going to be like, and then when they turn around, you know, you're generally described people from the front.

402
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 But if someone asked you, so what does your girlfriend look like from behind, you're like, and you would describe it.

403
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
 You wouldn't go, I don't know, I've never seen it.

404
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 So is this a minor detail?

405
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:04,300
 Is this just a weird fluke of human observation that we don't really describe stuff from the back, humanoid from the back?

406
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,300
 Or is this a clue to the origin of these things?

407
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
 Is this a clue that we never get descriptions from?

408
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,300
 I shouldn't say never, but I haven't come across it, at least that I can think of.

409
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,300
 And if there's a tale involved, I would assume you can just see the tale just from looking at them, the tales long enough.

410
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 But is this just some weird fluke of human observation, or is this a clue as to the origin of these things?

411
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
 How many people hallucinate the back of things?

412
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,300
 If these things are totally fake, it would make sense that nobody knows what the backs of aliens look like.

413
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:47,300
 If it's something real, are they purposely not letting us see their backs because it may reveal a little too much about their origin?

414
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 And if these things are interdimensional, maybe they don't have a back in the sense that we think they would.

415
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 Their back is still in their home dimension, a tether of some sort.

416
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:05,300
 I don't know, I have no idea, I never thought about this before until I read this article on the real news.

417
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
 We never see their backs.

418
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,300
 It's fascinating because we have all these questions about, is light drive possible?

419
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,300
 Do aliens come from another planet? Are they already here?

420
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,300
 Are they shape-shifting lizards? Are they taking over these big, weighty, heady questions?

421
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,300
 But then sometimes it's the small questions that really kind of trip you out.

422
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,300
 Why don't we ever see an alien's back?

423
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,300
 And it's always the small questions that help you figure out the puzzle.

424
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:44,300
 It's always those little tiny pieces you don't suspect that finally give you the ultimate answer to what's really going on.
