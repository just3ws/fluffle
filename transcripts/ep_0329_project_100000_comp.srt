1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 All a man wanted to do was have breakfast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 He just wanted to eat something in the morning.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 But then the aliens came.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at a brutal conspiracy, a real one.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Known as Project 100,000.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're just gonna jump right in with it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Here, grab my hand. Here, hold my hand.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Got it. Weeeeee!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We're jumping into a portal of stories.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Oh, swirling. What's the word?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 My amasa, mimasa?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Dang.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 There's a bunch of life swirling colors.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 We see words and I'm about to speak.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Float in front of us.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Has nothing to do with the story. Just thought it was pretty visual.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Weeeeee!

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 You're like, "Jason, if we had this available, why have we been using helicopters and dirgeables this whole time?"

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 This is, we're gonna call it, this is the rabbit hole.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Just jumping the rabbit hole.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 That's stupid. Never mind.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Forget it.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Now we're back on the land and we're just gonna walk.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So the Carpentercopter, we're gonna have Carpentercopter and we're gonna fly away.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I do like that visual though.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 We're going to Eagle River, Wisconsin, which if memory serves me correctly,

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 we've been here before and honestly, I'm slightly concerned.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I think I've actually covered this story before.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 With that level of certainty, let's start off with the story.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 [Sings]

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 61. Oh no, don't touch him. He might turn to dust.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 When you're 43, you're like, "No, you have many years ahead of you."

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Good luck. Good sir.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 61 years old, his name is Joe Simon-

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Simon-Ton. He's a chicken farmer.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So he raises chickens.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 This story is actually a request from Bennett.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Bennett is our resident Bigfoot expert.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But this story does not involve Bigfoot.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I think this might be the first story I've used of his that doesn't involve Bigfoot.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It involves a chicken farmer though, and I'll keep doing this introduction.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He's eating breakfast.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Now, two guesses as to what he's eating.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Probably eggs, maybe some chicken.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 That would be hard to raise a chicken and then cut its head off and eat it.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I eat whole chickens from like, rosars, rotisserie chickens.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But I don't think I could see a little egg hatch and a little yellow chicken pop out of it and then watch it walk around.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I mean, you're not stalking it. You do other stuff while it's growing up.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But eventually you're like, "Hey, Henry!"

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And the chickens like, "Well, waddling around."

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Chickens are pretty stupid, but...

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And then one day you're like, "Oh, I'm so hungry!"

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And then you chop it set off. I don't think I could do that.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I can eat nameless chickens that I don't know, but I couldn't eat chicken I knew.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And it's weird because it's the opposite.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 They say it's easier to kill somebody you don't know.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 No, no, no, that's wrong.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 It's easier to kill somebody you know than somebody you don't know.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The IRA, the Irish Republican Army, their final task before you joined

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 after all the training and stuff like that, you know, holding the gun over your head

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 and jump through tires and all that stuff.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 You had to be up on a rooftop with a certified member of the IRA

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and you'd be up there with your rifle and the guy would say, "Her."

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And then you'd have to point the rifle and shoot at a total stranger.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And if you couldn't do that, you weren't in the IRA.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 That's one of the hardest things to do.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And the reason why this has become a human murder story now, sorry Bennett,

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 the reason why is if you kill somebody you know you can justify it.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 If it's somebody you know, you can be like, "Oh, you know, they did these horrible things

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 or they deserved it or they had these health crises or they were an alcoholic or a drug user."

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 You can find some way to justify it.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Some way, if you have to, you can find some way to justify it.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 If it, or I was just really, really mad at them that day, you know, they did something.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I read the story the other day about this guy who shot his mom, no, stabbed his stepmom

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 because she was dancing during a Dallas Cowboy touchdown.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 He had hit a knife underneath the couch cushion instead of when he started stabbing her to death

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 because she was celebrating the...

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So you can kill people you know for the stupidest things,

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 but to be on a rooftop and to have someone picked out at random and to pull that trigger

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 is incredibly hard.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Very, very incredibly hard because it's just completely random.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 There's no reason why it could be anybody.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's psychologically hard.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 If a detective could do it, somebody who is mentally deficient could do it,

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 but for a normal person, no matter how dedicated they are towards the cause

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 or think they want to do it, they can't.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And that was the thing, the IRA need terrorist groups in general,

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 need people who can just kill randomly.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 They don't want you just killing your relatives.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It doesn't help. They're probably on the same side as you.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They need someone who can go on a British bar, see all the pretty girls talking to people,

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 go to the bar tender, smile in and laugh in, see the young soldier sitting there,

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 joking with his buddies and to put a bomb down and walk out.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's who they need.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They need someone completely hardened and stuff like that.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Anyways, chickens. Let's go back to killing random chickens.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's eating chickens for breakfast.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He's eating chickens for breakfast.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And he hears a weird noise. It's 11 a.m. in the morning too,

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 which is kind of late to eat.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I eat breakfast. It's kind of late.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It's 11 a.m.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 He hears a weird noise outside.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 A noise he describes as "nobby tires on wet pavement."

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 So, "wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum wum

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So he goes outside because you would if you heard a loud noise like that.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And he sees a silver UFO.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He describes it as two wash bowls turned face to face.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Two big old bowls, basically almost like a sphere.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 [makes sounds]

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That sounds like those aliens from Sesame Street, actually.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 This big sphere is kind of hovering above the ground and it lands.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's just to give you some dimensions.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's 12 feet tall, 30 feet in diameter.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So sizable, sizable.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's not a mothership, but it's doable.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's a cruiser.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 It lands and a little hatch opens up

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 and a little gangplank

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 [makes sounds]

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 and out walks an Italian dude.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Now, I'm reading this article.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 A really fascinating article.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 There's this website called thespacelizardreport.wordpress.com, right?

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And they were saying that there was a period of time between 1945

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and Betty and Barney Hill, which is one of the most famous UFO abduction stories,

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 where aliens looked totally different all the time.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 You had robots, and you had Italians in this story,

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 and you had guys in glowing suits, and tiny guys and big guys and all this stuff.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And they said once Betty and Barney happened and the book Communion came out,

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 it all kind of coalesced into, this is what aliens look like,

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 they have the tiny little head, the grays, basically.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And they were saying that there was a period in time where you never really knew

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 what was going to get off the craft.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And I'll take a look at that phenomenon in the future,

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 because I have some interesting theories on that.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 For now, a bunch of Italians get off this spaceship.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Now, they weren't actually ethnically Italian.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 They looked Italian.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They had dark skin, olive skin, and there's no notes on how much body hair they had,

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 or the gold medallions, but they also were only 5 feet tall,

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 which is not stereotypically how Italians are known to be.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 But anyways, these 5 foot tall Italian looking aliens,

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 one of them gets off the ship, right?

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And he sees two other aliens through the hatch,

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 but one of them gets off the ship and walks down,

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 and he's holding a giant vase with two, like a jug,

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 a giant jug with two handles on it.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And he walks up to Joe and he's just holding it.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Now, there's no words being exchanged, and Joe's looking at this alien,

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 the alien's looking at him with his jug,

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 and Joe realizes, "Oh, he needs water."

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And I can do that.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I can go get you some water.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He takes the jug from the alien, walks over to the nearest water source,

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 pumps some water in it.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 So he gets the water.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He brings it back.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Now, this might be the first case of interstellar trade.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Yeah, yeah, ancient aliens, Nazca lions, all that stuff.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Nazca lions has been debunked.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Ancient aliens, for the most part, have been debunked.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 This is what we're talking about.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 When we're talking about the very first--

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'm gonna put my flag in this.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 This is the very first encounter of interstellar trade.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And we're like, "Jason, you did a story six months back

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 that took place three months before that, maybe,

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 but I don't remember that one."

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 He gives these aliens this water.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And the aliens go, "Hmm, yes."

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 They don't actually say that.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 No words are spoken.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But in their heads, they're thinking, "Let's give this dude something."

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So as Joe is standing there and they're taking the water into the ship,

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 he sees somebody like flipping this little, like, spatula thing.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 He's cooking.

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Someone's cooking inside the spaceship.

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Which seems like a bad idea, for a couple reasons.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 One, carbon monoxide poisoning.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But maybe they love carbon monoxide.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Maybe they hate oxygen.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Two, you have an interstellar spaceship.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I mean, maybe this is just not the mothership.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Maybe this is the thing.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 But there's not a lot of room.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Like, you don't have a hot plate and a helicopter.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Like, you can have a kitchen and a sub because they're so huge.

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But something that's 12 feet by 30 feet, do you really have room for an oven in that thing?

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 But apparently they did because they ended up making him pancakes.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 They made him four little pancakes.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Probably about the size of your hand.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Probably about the size of your hand.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 A normal human hand.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Don't be a giant and be like, "Oh, are they this big?"

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And smash all my equipment as you put...

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And apparently now you know where I live.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 You can bust through my door and slam your hand on my computer.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 A normal human hand.

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 They're about that big.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So they give him four pancakes and then they take off.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And as they're flying away, he goes, "No, here's the thing.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 You just give some human looking aliens.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 They weren't big slug people.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 They weren't reptilians or greys or any of the weirdo, gross looking kinds."

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And you give some aliens water and they just give you four flakes of food.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 First off, how do you know that they're food?

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Secondly, would you eat them?

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, I would.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I would, might be hesitant and definitely when I was younger.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Like, as the alien was handing me something, I would just eat it.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Now they'll be like, "Oh no, that was our map.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Our map is on pancakes.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You idiot.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 We'll never find our way home now."

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But if they gave me some food and I knew it was food,

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I would probably eat one of them.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I'm like, "Mmm, tastes like mysteries of the cosmos."

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 But anyways, he ate one of them.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 He said it tasted like cardboard.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And he's like, "Damn you aliens.

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I give you delicious water and you gave me nothing but cardboard."

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 He's like shaking his fist.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 The ship's flying away.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They're like, "Oh, can you believe it?

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 He ate our cardboard."

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And they disappear into the space place.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 They disappear into the cosmos.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So anyways, but he did keep three of them.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And he still had them for a long time.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 He ended up reporting this to the media, which he highly regretted.

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 He said he wished that he had never done it,

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 because the reporters annoyed him all the time.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He imagined how he would feel nowadays.

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I can't even watch the news without being annoyed,

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 let alone having a bunch of reporters on my front lawn.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And I'm a journalism major.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 That's what might decrease.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And I can't stand reporters nowadays.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 But anyways, in 1961, this guy's getting super annoyed by them being like,

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 "Can you show us the pancakes?"

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And he would.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 There's photos of Joe holding a tiny little pancake.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It looks like a burnt piece.

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It looks like a pancake, but it's super thin.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 You can kind of see through it.

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 It's probably not as big as the hand, actually.

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I think it's as big as your palm.

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Once I made that descriptor, I was like,

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 "Eh, I think I overshot it."

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 But anyways, and he said, "Tastes like cardboard."

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 One of the pancakes was sent to a laboratory.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And apparently, it's...

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Okay, so it is a real pancake, in a sense.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It's flattened material.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Its ingredients are flour, sugar, and grease.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So those are all things you can get pretty much anywhere on Earth.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I was reading one article and it said,

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 "Misteriously, the pancakes had no salt."

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Now, I don't know anything about cooking or baking.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I barely know a lot about preparing food at any point.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I have almost given myself food poisoning multiple times

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 and have given myself food poisoning at least two or three times.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I'm very, very bad at food preparation.

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 So I don't know anything about it.

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 So when I read that, and again, I'm skeptical, but I'm also an idiot.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So when I read that, I was like,

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 "Well, golly, there's no salt in them? What a mystery!

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 How do you make a pancake without salt?"

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And then I went...

276
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I researched this story back when Bennett sent it to me.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And thank you, Bennett, for the recommendation.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And then when I was going, re-reading it to get these notes together for this episode,

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I was like, "No salt? Well, dad, never! How is that possible?"

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And then I thought, "Well, I wonder if you need to salt to make pancakes in the first place?"

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So I typed in "no salt pancakes."

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And apparently, not only can you make pancakes without salt,

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 it's not a super common ingredient.

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Like, you can throw salt in there or not.

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So that's... don't waste my time, article, on the Internet.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Don't tell me it's unusual to not have salt when it doesn't seem to be like a make-or-break ingredient.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So people have thought it was a hoax.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Here's my question about this whole thing.

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I get why people would hoax alien stuff for attention, or because they really...

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Okay, with alien stuff, it either really happened, or you're doing it for attention,

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 you're faking it for attention, or you've mistaken a natural phenomenon for something else.

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Or you're having some sort of mental breakdown.

293
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Now, this whole experience, he gets the water jug, he fills it up, he goes,

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 he gets a couple pancakes, the UFO takes off.

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 If he was just doing this for attention, he could have just said,

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 "Well, a bunch of aliens, a bunch of Italians landed in my front yard,

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 and I gave him some water, and they flew away."

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 The fact that he has the pancakes, why would you manufacture such stupid evidence for your hoax?

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I guess is what I'm getting at.

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Like, it would have been much easier to be like, "Look at this piece of metal I found,

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 or look at these indentations in my yard, or look at any other number of phenomenon

302
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 you could easily fake to support your story."

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Why space pancakes?

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Why would you then go out of your way to make disgusting, saltless pancakes that taste like cardboard,

305
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and be like, "I only got four of them."

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The idea, the...

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It's that whole thing that I would say about 9/11.

308
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 If the government made up the whole thing, and it was not al-Qaeda, right?

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 If the government put bombs in the building, and it was all this inside job to wage war against Iraq and Afghanistan,

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and they made it up, why are, what is it, 17/19 hijackers from Saudi Arabia?

311
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Like, if you're going to make it up, they should have made all...

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Because they're making up the identities of all these people, they should have said,

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 "All these hijackers came from Iraq and Afghanistan."

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 They could have said, "Hi, Jackers came from Iraq, I ran in Afghanistan."

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 It was this whole thing, because they're making it up.

316
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 They're making it up from the ground up, so why would such a key detail be our allies?

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 That's the same thing here.

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 If you're... If he's making it up, why would he miss the main piece of evidence that he...

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 The linchpin of his story is the pancakes.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So if he's making it up, why would he make up such a stupid detail?

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Why wouldn't he make up a detail of...

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 They handed me this amulet, or they handed me this polished rock, and then...

323
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Or I lost it, because a lot of these stories, they go, "Well, they gave me this thing and I lost it."

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Or, "Here, something that is less stupid than pancakes."

325
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I honestly believe that this guy got pancakes from an alien.

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I honestly think that, yes, the most likely answer is that it's a total hoax.

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 But the second most likely answer is, because the evidence is so dumb, that it's probably true.

328
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Because otherwise, if it was a hoax from the ground up, it would be a better executed hoax.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And in the end, he wished that he hadn't told anybody about it anyways.

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 It is possible that Joe Simonson just wanted to sit down and enjoy a morning meal of some chicken and some eggs,

331
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and instead also enjoyed a disgusting cardboard pancake from an alien traveler billions of miles away.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

333
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Our next story is actually one of those stories that I love.

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's one of those conspiracy theories that actually happened and affected people's lives.

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I was talking about this on the livestream, the Halloween livestream.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 People get so focused on conspiracy theories that are super sexy, but most likely aren't true,

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 or have so many details that aren't true that they pretty much become a fairy tale.

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And there's conspiracies all the time that actually have happened that affect people's lives.

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 The year is 1966. We are leaving behind Joe's farm. I have a bunch of chickens in the carbonic copter.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I'm trying to save them. I'm like, "Live with me, guys. We won't eat you. We won't eat you."

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And you go, "Jason, didn't you just tell me you eat whole chickens all the time, and you have no problem with it?"

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 As long as you don't know their names. I was like, "Yeah, but I know these guys' names."

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And then someone is, um... Mmmmm... That chicken's looking really nervous.

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 It's like, "Dude, my name's Larry, man. My name's Larry. Remember me?"

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I'm like, starting to salivate as I can't remember his name.

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Anyways, we hear a bunch of chickens getting slaughtered as the helicopter flies off into the sunset.

347
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So it's October 1966. The Vietnam War is in full swing.

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so is the War on Poverty.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 President B. Johnson's War on Poverty.

350
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That was a big thing he was going for, trying to bring everyone out of utter, utter poverty.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Hence the name, War on Poverty.

352
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And there was this guy, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And I want to give a shout out to this. Most of this information is from an article called "McNamara's Boys"

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 on history.net by Hamilton Gregory.

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 He's writing a book on this topic, and he's an expert with this story.

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So I want to give a shout out to him, because it's all this information that's coming from this source.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 McNamara, Robert McNamara goes, "Listen, we got to do more in Vietnam.

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 We got to get more people over there. We got to get new good soldiers over there."

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 President Johnson's trying to get all these inner city kids out of poverty.

360
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Peanut butter jelly guys. Let's Reese's Peanut Butter Cup this.

361
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 So Robert McNamara's looking at this, and he goes, "Let's get recruitment drives in the inner city."

362
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I didn't know this before I read about this.

363
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The military is mostly staffed with middle class, the children of the middle class.

364
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I always thought it was people like Boys in the Hood, where they're like, "Ugh, I can't get out of the ghetto.

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 This totally sucks. I'm going to join the military."

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And then, "Ricky!"

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 A little spoiler alert for a 40 year old movie.

368
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I knew that wasn't the bulk of the military, but I figured that it was lower to middle class.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But it's mostly all middle class military, especially back in the 60s.

370
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Now, of course, they had the draft going on, but when you had, and you would get people on the verge of like,

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 but this wasn't like lower class economically.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 This was, they wanted poor people to be in the army now.

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 They wanted people who were raised in abject poverty.

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Now, before you join the military, you have to take the ASFAB, which is the Armed Services Vocational...

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Something, something.

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Every kid in America has to take it, at least when I was a kid.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We all had to take it, and the military recruiter would come out and talk to you and all that stuff.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 It's like a test, and it determines what branch you'll be in the military and how smart you are.

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Like, basically it will determine not only where you'll be at in the military,

380
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 but are you too stupid to be in the military to begin with?

381
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's basically an IQ test on that level.

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And a lot of the people in poverty were failing the ASFAB, they were getting drafted, they were getting recruited, and they were failing the test.

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Now, you go, "Well, dude, they're just getting drafted. Why not just put them out there with a gun? Who cares if they're stupid?"

384
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's a huge... We're not talking... We're talking force gum, stupid.

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We're not talking... We're not talking, "Hey man, I'm really not good at pre-algebra."

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 We're talking me not no math.

387
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 We're talking mongo-level intelligence in the jungle of Vietnam.

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And Robert McNamara was like, "We're going to get these kids, we're going to take them out of poverty, we're going to give them a job, we're going to give them a career path."

389
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We're not going to put them into combat, okay? That's not our plan.

390
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 We're going to use them in support roles, and then we can take our other, more educated people, put them into combat, put them into these other roles.

391
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Now, Robert McNamara was a firm believer in technology.

392
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He believed that the Vietnam War would be when with computers, and there's this giant robot walking through the jungle, "Kill, kill, terminator."

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 He thought that technology and all these analytical models would win the day, and the newest invention, videotapes.

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 He felt that if you could take an idiot soldier, an idiot who came out of inner-city Chicago, you could sit him down, show him video cassettes all day long, teach him to be as competent as someone who had had a high school education.

395
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Because these guys who were failing the ASFAB were clocking in, like, "At, if you scored a 20 on your ASFAB, that's about a fifth level education."

396
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Again, these guys are morons.

397
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They're not people like, "Yeah, I dropped out of high school because I got a girl pregnant when I was sophomore." These guys are fifth grade level education.

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Because those guys who did a war like sophomore, yeah, they were poor, they got drafted, they passed the test, they got in, no problem.

399
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 This war on poverty was America's dumbest citizens being put into America's war.

400
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And Robert McNamara said, "Let's do this. We're going to call it Project 100,000."

401
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Because every year, it's a tragedy, he said, a tragedy, that every year 100,000 men were not able to join the military because they failed out of the ASFAB.

402
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Peanut butter jelly. All these guys are poor, so we're helping Johnson. We need more men over there.

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 People were flipping out. They thought this was the stupidest idea ever.

404
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 At one point, Robert McNamara, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, decorated official too. He wasn't just some guy picked out of the crowd.

405
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He also had military background. He was given some speech at a veterans hospital, and a captain stood up and said, "What you're doing is wrong."

406
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You can't do that in the military. You're not supposed to just jump up and start criticizing people.

407
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You can if they're lower than you, but Robert McNamara outranked them. I don't remember what his actual rank was, but...

408
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I mean, Defense Secretary, for one, people were really upset, and they were like, "Listen, this is not going to end well."

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Robert McNamara was like, "No, no, this is going to be great. These are my boys." McNamara's boys.

410
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 They were actually called New Standards Men, because there was basically new standards, lower standards, really, to get them into the military.

411
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Because of this program, between 1966 and 1971, when it ended, there was an additional 354,000 men allowed to join into the military and go to Vietnam.

412
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 A very, very large number. I mean, the military, I think our military right now is like 2 million.

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So, yeah, a lot. And you're starting to have people who just aren't competent.

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Let's look at some of these quotes about these soldiers here.

415
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "These were the guys who could not hack it during regular basic training. It was painful to watch.

416
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Some of them could not even get the hang of so simple a thing as standing at attention and otherwise severely unsuited for military life."

417
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Here's another quote. "This was from a war correspondent who was, who served in Vietnam named Joseph Galloway.

418
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 The young men of Project 100,000 couldn't read. They had to be taught to tie their boots.

419
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 They often failed basic training and were recycled over and over until they finally reached some low standard and were declared trained and ready.

420
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 They could not be taught any more demanding job than trigger pulling.

421
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 So most of them went straight into combat, where the learning curve is steep and deadly."

422
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Here's another quote. "This was from Colonel David Hackworth.

423
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Project 100,000 was implemented to produce more grunts for the killing fields of Vietnam.

424
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It took unfit recruits from the bottom of the barrel and rushed them to Vietnam.

425
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 The result was human applesauce."

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 So despite the idea that these guys weren't going to see combat, or that wasn't going to be their main thing,

427
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 a lot of them ended up in the army, a lot ended up in the Marines, and it was a bloodbath.

428
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 If you're having a hard time tying your shoes, you're going to have hard time operating an M16.

429
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 There was this one guy who was in the military and his nephew was put into Project 100,000.

430
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And he started making calls and he's like, "Don't, no, take him out please. This guy, he's an idiot."

431
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 His family started writing the senator saying, "Listen, he's not smart enough to do this stuff."

432
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And they were really pushing to get him, if they couldn't get him out of the military, get him into a support role.

433
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He ended up, he was in Vietnam on the front lines.

434
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And one of his buddies got shot and he ran out to help him and took a bullet right through the neck and died.

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And the veteran went on to say, "That destroyed our family.

436
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Like, we lost, basically, you lose faith in your government when it can't protect people who are mentally handicapped."

437
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 At a level, these guys, when you're talking about ASFAB 20, you're talking about people who have about an IQ around 80.

438
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 IQ around 70, you are considered mentally handicapped.

439
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 So, slightly above, they are forest-gump level at that point.

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Maybe a little bit above.

441
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But the machine kept turning.

442
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And Robert McNamara was like, "No, this is absolutely working.

443
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I got these young men coming up to me and they're saying, 'Thank you, sir. I never would have made it.

444
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I got a job. I got a career path. Thank you for lowering the standards.'"

445
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And Robert McNamara was hearing these stories.

446
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But everyone else on the ground was seeing the results, the casualties out of the 354,000 men and women actually, recruited during this drive.

447
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Out of that amount, 5,400 of them died in Vietnam, which was, they had a three times more likely chance of being killed in Vietnam

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 than people who were brought in through other means, i.e. passing the test as it was intended.

449
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Getting in not because of some sort of pet project by Robert McNamara.

450
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So, you're like, "Okay, 350,000 people sign up. You lose 5,400. That's not bad."

451
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Well, what happened was, the tragedy really started after the war, or as they were leaving.

452
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So, you had 354,000. Now, these guys couldn't stand that attention.

453
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 We're drug users. We're AWOL. They were people who were not well-fitted for the society they came from.

454
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And now you put them in a very regimented military society.

455
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 These groups, these two groups, you had inner city black kids and rural white kids.

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 That's really what Project 100,000 was taking people from.

457
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 It was taking young dummies from the farm and young dummies from the streets,

458
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and you're putting them in this super regimented lifestyle, and it's just not working out.

459
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 So, when they were leaving the military, they weren't getting honorable discharges.

460
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 They were getting less than honorable discharge because they mouthed off at an officer,

461
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 or they couldn't keep their bed right, or whatever they, or AWOL, or something serious like drug use.

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 So, they get recruited or drafted into the military, even though they were too stupid to do it in the first place.

463
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Get sucked into this machine, survive, bombs going off, getting all these mental issues of having to be in Vietnam,

464
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and then you get a less than honorable discharge. They come back home, nobody will hire them.

465
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So, when we look back at that program, they say people in this Project 100,000,

466
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 which the goal was, the stated goal was to lift them out of poverty, give them a career path,

467
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 let them serve in the military, and then when they come out, they have military experience,

468
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 which is always very, very attractive to employers.

469
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 When they came back statistically, they either stayed in their same economic level, or did worse,

470
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 because now no one would hire them because they're coming back with papers showing

471
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 that they were less than honorable discharge from the military.

472
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And it doesn't say for what. It could have been that they slept with the general's daughter, which is kind of sexy.

473
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It could have been that they were running heroin. You don't know. It just says less than honorable discharge.

474
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So, a massive backfire. And this program went from being called McNamara's Boys to McNamara's morons,

475
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 and he, Robert McNamara, that name drove him nuts, and it haunted him for years.

476
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And even up until the point where he died, he started admitting mistakes like,

477
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 "We could have done this differently in Vietnam. Yeah, we should have had this situation like maybe we shouldn't have done this."

478
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Even to his grave, he was like, "No, McNamara's Boys, Project 100,000, that was a good plan. We helped people."

479
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And everyone else, it just was standing around his deathbed, kind of shaking their head, going, "It wasn't. It was a terrible plan."

480
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 McNamara's morons, McNamara's Boys, whatever title you want to use for it, it was a failed program.

481
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 It tried to pull men out of poverty, but it failed so many of them.

482
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 It was a program that was designed to help and ended up hurting a good amount of people.

483
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 But either way, the military has now put in rules that do not allow them to take people who score under 20 on the ASFAB.

484
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 That has been the rule since the end of Project 100,000, but the question remains, will that rule stand when America finds itself in another brutal and drawn-out war?

485
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
