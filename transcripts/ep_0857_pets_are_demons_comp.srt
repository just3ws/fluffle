1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 What would you do if you were confronted by an alien creature and it revealed your darkest

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
 desires?

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,320
 Sounds like you want to have sex with the alien, but that's not what that's about.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,200
 Or is it?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,940
 And then we meet a couple living in a haunted house with an experience so unique it makes

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,640
 us ask the question.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,280
 Are the furry companions we know as our pets actually demonic entities?

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:42,480
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,680
 I'm your host Jason Garvin or I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too as you have a pet on your lap right now.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,200
 You're like uh I don't know if I should pet this guy or throw him outside.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,120
 Well just side of the end of the episode you guys can figure out if your pets are really

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
 your pets.

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,160
 But first off let's go ahead and introduce today's newest Patreon supporter walking into

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,280
 Dead Rabbit Command.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,280
 Give it up for Simon.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,280
 Woohoo come on in buddy.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,680
 I don't know why I sound like a cowboy all of a sudden.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
 Russell left them little doggies.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,600
 Simon you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,280
 If you guys cancel for the Patreon I totally understand.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,120
 Just help spread the word about this show that really really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,400
 Simon let's go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,640
 We are gonna row all the way out to Indiana.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,520
 You guys are like Jason what river?

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
 Do you know anything about US geography?

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 We're rowing.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,120
 Okay we put the rowboat on a flatbed truck and Simon is driving us.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,840
 We're seeing row row row your boat the whole time.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,000
 There's an intercom right into the cab of the truck.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,240
 After after he loses his sanity he drives us out to Lucky Point Indiana.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,600
 It's November 1st 1980.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 It's 9pm.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,320
 And we're hiding in the bushes.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're hiding from Simon.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,520
 He's gonna murder us for torturing him the whole time.

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,440
 And as we're in the bushes we see a deputy sheriff drive by.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 We'll call him Duke.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
 We don't have his actual name.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,320
 Duke is driving by in his patrol car and he just kind of slows to a stop.

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,580
 He opens the door he gets out and he's just standing there kind of looking up at the night

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
 sky.

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,840
 It's his break right.

46
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,200
 He's already given enough tickets and probably stopped like a bank robbery or two.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
 I don't know what cops do on a normal day.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,520
 But he's out there and he's like I don't know why I live in Gotham City all of a sudden.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,800
 I don't know why the crime rate is so high.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,000
 He's standing outside of his car just kind of taking a break at night.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,080
 And suddenly in the sky appears a black triangle.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,640
 A very typical UFO shape.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,200
 There's a black triangle in the sky is floating there.

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,680
 And he says it's only around 200 feet from him which is uncomfortably close.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,480
 It's floating there in the sky and he's like he looks up and he sees there's windows on

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,200
 this craft and inside the vehicle he sees five humanoids looking out the window staring

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,600
 at him.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,280
 He's looking up at these windows.

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,400
 These little alien humanoids are looking down on him and he describes them as classic

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 greys.

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,280
 He can only see them from the waist up but they have large heads, thin necks, small bodies

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,160
 and gray skin.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,680
 He's looking up at this vehicle and these humanoids, these great aliens are looking

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,480
 down at him.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 And in his head he hears one of these aliens ask, "Why do you hate the Iranians?"

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,760
 Now Duke has been shocked a lot in the past couple of minutes.

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 He's seen a UFO appear.

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,720
 He's seen five visitors from an extraterrestrial world.

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
 But he is now he's insulted.

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,640
 He's shocked and insulted and he remembers I was looking up at this vehicle and I heard

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,600
 this telepathic message ask why I hated the Iranians and I thought back to them I don't

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,000
 hate anyone.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,960
 And at that point one of the greys looks at the other four and then the triangle shoots

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,640
 up into the night sky so quickly it disappears from view.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,240
 That story, I got it from ThinkAboutDucks.com.

76
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,400
 They got it from a book called Regional Encounters, the FC Files by Francis L. Ridge.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
 This was an interesting story to me.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,760
 One, I know it's super short but you're like, "Oh great, Jason's going to drone off for

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,200
 ten minutes about some minute detail."

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,120
 Man, you really do listen to this podcast a lot.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,600
 This story is so interesting to me on two levels.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,520
 One, you just have the basic UFO stuff, right?

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
 Just as is.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,000
 And the alien having to telepathic communication, again that's all basic UFO stuff.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,200
 The reason why I wanted to talk about this story is we have this idea, I think it's terrifying

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,720
 already, the power level that a lot of these aliens have.

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,400
 They can abduct you, they can teleport you through walls, a lot of people have tried

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
 out running these things, they can't, they can mess with reality, they can make you feel

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
 like you're somewhere else when you're really in your bedroom.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,560
 The power level of aliens in general and specifically the gray aliens is overwhelming.

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,080
 Aliens talking to humans telepathically, that's a trope, that is really, really common in

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,480
 alien lore.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:45,080
 But I don't know why I never thought that aliens could expose dark secrets of ours.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,280
 I always figured like they could talk to us telepathically but I didn't know that they

95
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,360
 could necessarily read our minds.

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,880
 Now it's possible that these aliens got this detail wrong and this dude wasn't racist

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,480
 against Iranians.

98
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,960
 But maybe this guy is so racist towards Iranians he doesn't even know it.

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,920
 But let's say that he's lying, they're not around the whole alien encounter, not that

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,560
 he made the whole thing up.

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,240
 But imagine this, you had an alien encounter and you wanted to tell the story, you wanted

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,680
 to tell the story to a UFO investigator but the UFO investigator is some guy from Iran.

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,880
 He's like "Hi, yeah, I just came over from Iran and now I'm investigating UFOs over here.

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
 What's your story?"

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,160
 Duke and Duke's like "Uh, uh, and then the aliens asked if I hated Iranians and the

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,520
 author stops and he's looking at him and he's like "But I don't, I don't."

107
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,320
 The author's like "Oh, okay, so the aliens, the aliens with this galaxy spany technology

108
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,920
 read your mind wrong.

109
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 The."

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,840
 And then the Duke's like "Phew, that was a close one."

111
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
 I guess I never really thought, the aliens could have got it wrong but I guess I never

112
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,840
 really thought like if aliens abducted me, if aliens abducted me and they're like "Greetings,

113
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,240
 Jason, we are here from the galactic..."

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,840
 Oh, you have those thoughts?

115
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,440
 You're thinking about that stuff?

116
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 What?

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,480
 They're all throwing up space vomit, it's like floating around.

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,720
 I'm like "Ah, like, that's weird, right?

119
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 That's super creepy.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,520
 I knew aliens could talk to us telepathically but I didn't know they could read our minds

121
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,960
 because like what if like as you're communicating with this grey alien and he's talking about

122
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,680
 curing disease and stuff like that, some sexy grey alien walks by with like grey alien

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,280
 boobies and stuff and I'm like looking at her and I'm thinking about all the stuff I'm

124
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,880
 gonna do to this grey alien lady and they're like "That's my mom, that's my mom, you sicko!"

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,720
 I never thought about that before.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,440
 To me there's a difference between having telepathic communication and straight up being

127
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,880
 able to read my mind and tell.

128
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,520
 Like now that's way more terrifying.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,400
 If aliens abducted me and probed me, I mean I'm not saying like that would be the most

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,480
 comfortable thing but it would be far worse if they were probing you and they're like

131
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,840
 "Wow, he really likes this, let's stop doing this, let's stop doing this experiment."

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
 That's creepy.

133
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,400
 The fact that you would have aliens that could tell you had like a foot fetish or you really,

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,240
 really were like a big ol' creepo and stuff like that, that's not cool.

135
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
 That's not cool aliens.

136
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,120
 I, and you know it makes me wonder too, we cover stories recently about people being

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,520
 abducted by aliens and then the aliens going "Oh, you're not fit for our experiments."

138
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,760
 And then leaving them back on earth and maybe it's because those people were so perverted,

139
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
 the aliens didn't want to have them around.

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,880
 Super creepy, like that is such an intrusion of my privacy.

141
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,440
 I mean again, I was thinking about being this dude's mom, this alien mom as she's like bringing

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 out a tray of cookies for all the abductees.

143
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,520
 Here you go, make sure you have some lemonade too.

144
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,880
 Yeah, this guy may or may not have hated Iranians, I don't know for sure, he says that he didn't

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,000
 but it's possible that he did and the aliens were exposing that and that shocked him.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,400
 It would be insulting and it would be an invasion of my privacy.

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,280
 I never once considered the thought that even through all this telepathic communication

148
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,360
 with aliens, I never once considered the thought that they would be able to read my mind and

149
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,880
 know stuff about me.

150
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,680
 And maybe that's the reason why aliens don't visit us, because they can read our minds

151
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,480
 and they're like these, these, this is the grossest, most perverted species in the galaxy.

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,440
 Luckily, my only real hang up is wanting to bring that alien mom.

153
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:47,320
 I don't have a lot of deep dark secrets, but I mean you don't want any of them in the galactic

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
 newspaper, right?

155
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,680
 You don't want to hear about that.

156
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,920
 Maybe how we have stories about cattle mutilations on alien planets, they have stories, there's

157
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,600
 like great aliens come to earth, find out a man likes having bananas stuck up his butthole.

158
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 I don't know.

159
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,120
 That would make the newspaper, I'm sure there's other more important things in the galaxy.

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,560
 I don't know why you're so hung up on this.

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,320
 If that makes galactic news, then there's really nothing going on anywhere else.

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,080
 But yeah, I just, what an invasion of privacy, right?

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,640
 Simon, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

164
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,240
 We're gonna leave behind all these aliens that are still throwing up.

165
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
 We're leaving behind this UFO.

166
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 We're headed all the way out to a small house in suburban America.

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:44,080
 As we're headed out there, I wanted to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

168
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,800
 I know the critics hated this movie, but on my break, I watched the brand new Netflix

169
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,920
 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

170
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,120
 And here's a fact that not a lot of people know about me because it's not something that

171
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,160
 you would ever discuss in public.

172
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,040
 I'm a huge Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan.

173
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,600
 I love Leatherface.

174
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,000
 I actually used to have a Texas Chainsaw Massacre poster in my house for the reboot,

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,960
 for the sequel of the reboot.

176
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,160
 That's how deep I am into Leatherface lore.

177
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,960
 It was like the seventh film was a sequel to a reboot, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A New

178
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
 Beginning.

179
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
 I loved that movie.

180
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,920
 That was one of my favorite Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies.

181
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,840
 It was actually probably in my top 50 favorite horror movies.

182
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,000
 I recently watched the new Netflix Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It is so good.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,880
 It is so good.

185
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
 The characters are really complex.

186
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 It was funny.

187
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,760
 A lot of people were talking trash about the characters in it.

188
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,920
 All the characters are really well-rounded with multiple motivations.

189
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
 Really fascinating.

190
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,400
 And it's so disgusting.

191
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,280
 It is the worst Chainsaw kills.

192
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
 I have a Chainsaw O-Meter.

193
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,440
 I've seen all of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies except for Texas Chainsaw.

194
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,760
 That was the one where they left off the word massacre and it was more of a coming of age

195
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,440
 story and it was like this woman's bond with Leatherface.

196
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 I haven't watched it.

197
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 I don't know.

198
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 It sounds terrible.

199
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,400
 But this one, Leatherface is at it again.

200
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,080
 He gets his mom's face.

201
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,400
 He puts it on and he runs around a town chopping people up with his chainsaw.

202
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,440
 And he's throwing his chainsaw.

203
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,320
 He throws it in a moving car and he slides it across the ground so people are jumping

204
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
 out of the way.

205
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,200
 You're like, "Jason, you make this movie sound worse than I even thought it was."

206
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,280
 No dude, it's super dope.

207
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,360
 And the fight scenes are cool.

208
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,960
 And the characters, there was the quote unquote racist mechanic, the racist Texas mechanic

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
 and he wasn't racist.

210
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,920
 He was just a mechanic in Texas.

211
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,760
 But all the characters thought he was racist.

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,120
 It was really interesting.

213
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 All these characters have multi-layered backgrounds.

214
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
 Excitement for Leatherface.

215
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,280
 He's just a maniac who wears people's faces.

216
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,200
 But anyways, I loved it.

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,880
 And there is this scene that I, it wasn't going to watch a movie.

218
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,960
 There's this scene that became a meme that I heard about over and over again where Leatherface,

219
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,840
 because it's like in modern times, right?

220
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
 So it's all these Instagram influencers go to Texas.

221
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,080
 Okay, the plot's a little, the set-up's a little weird.

222
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,320
 But all these Instagram influencers go to this little town in Texas and they have a

223
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,600
 party bus and there is a scene where Leatherface has his chainsaw and this guy, like, everyone

224
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,440
 pulls their phones out to record this guy with his chainsaw and someone goes, "Take

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,400
 one more step and you're totally canceled, dude."

226
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,120
 And I remember I was, I heard that meme and how dumb is that?

227
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,920
 Like you're trying to use the new jargon of the kids.

228
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,280
 That scene, it's nightmare inducing.

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
 It's like only three minutes long.

230
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
 You can watch it on YouTube.

231
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
 It's so disgusting.

232
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,160
 He's on a party bus and some guy goes, "You're totally canceled, bro."

233
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,080
 And then the next three minutes is just guts going everywhere.

234
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,160
 It's so gross.

235
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,000
 He puts the chainsaw through a guy's butt crack.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,280
 It comes out through the dude's crotch and then begins using him to saw a woman in half.

237
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,360
 It's horrifying.

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
 It's so gross.

239
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,040
 So, so Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix, honestly, 10 out of 10 stars.

240
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,360
 It's probably the second best Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie next to the original.

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,800
 Dead Rabbit, you're vomiting with the aliens and now you're like, "Jason, why are you,

242
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,120
 the aliens, the aliens are going to reach your mind and find out you like Texas Chainsaw

243
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
 Massacre movies."

244
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,960
 That's probably the most embarrassing thing you could have stated.

245
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,200
 Dead Rabbit recommends Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Netflix edition.

246
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 I really, really enjoyed it.

247
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,480
 If you are a leather face of a fish and a hodow, which is none of you, you'll love it.

248
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,440
 If you love horror movies, you'll love it.

249
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,800
 If it's really stylistically directed, you'll love it.

250
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,160
 But for the other 99% of you, give it a watch or watch the clip on YouTube or just forget

251
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,960
 that I ever recommended the movie.

252
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,240
 And truly, Dead Rabbit recommends Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

253
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 So Simon, go ahead and land this carbon helicopter in the suburban neighborhood.

254
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,340
 We're walking around, it's the middle of the day.

255
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,840
 The reason why we're in this neighborhood is we are going to visit the house of someone

256
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,920
 online to go by the name Lemsicles, but we're going to call them Betty.

257
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 Now I don't like the name.

258
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,640
 We're going to call them Patricia.

259
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,880
 This is a story that had been going on for a while, but it really culminated the last

260
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,760
 week of March 2022.

261
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,840
 So very, very recent story.

262
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,480
 We're in North Texas actually.

263
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
 I didn't know that there was a location for this story.

264
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 Look at my notes again.

265
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,520
 We're in North Texas.

266
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,880
 And Patricia is dating this man named Charles.

267
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,520
 And Charles lives in this two-story house that she stays over often at.

268
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,280
 And she said, "I was over in the house and when we would be sitting there together or

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,160
 when we would be watching television or whatever, every so often you would hear the sounds of

270
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:15,280
 boots stomping down the stairs."

271
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
 And I don't believe in ghosts though.

272
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
 I don't believe in ghosts and I'd hear them.

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,640
 There has to be a reason for that.

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
 The house is settling.

275
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,960
 Or I keep putting my boots at the top of the stairs, but they're precariously balanced

276
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,840
 when they fall down.

277
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 But it can't be ghosts.

278
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,920
 And don't believe in ghosts.

279
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,160
 And she said, "Yeah, my boyfriend always kind of laughed it off as well.

280
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,800
 You know, it happens all the time, but I don't know what it is and I don't not worry about

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,080
 it or anything like that."

282
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,360
 And as they continue to date and the relationship becomes more serious, eventually she moves

283
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 in with him.

284
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,080
 And when she moves in, she brings her pets.

285
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,720
 There's quite a few pets in this story, but specifically, we're going to be focusing on

286
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,360
 a cat and then a dog named Oatmeal.

287
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,560
 Also goes by the name of Odie.

288
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,680
 They're living together.

289
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
 Things going well.

290
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 One of the...

291
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,320
 They have a different kind of work schedule.

292
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,720
 So she goes to bed before he does.

293
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,120
 She leaves for work before he wakes up.

294
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,560
 So they have different chores to make sure the house is running efficiently.

295
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,040
 One of the things is that it's his job to get the dogs in for the night.

296
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,960
 They don't have a doggie door in the backyard.

297
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,440
 So it's his job to make sure that before they go to bed, the dogs are back in the house.

298
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,480
 So everybody is safe from leather face.

299
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,880
 She didn't say that, but you never know.

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,440
 She said one night she's downstairs.

301
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
 She's watching a movie.

302
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,360
 This is when you know they've been dating for a while.

303
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,040
 She's downstairs watching a movie by herself.

304
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,800
 He's upstairs playing video games.

305
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
 And she's sitting there and she hears a...

306
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,120
 It's not a maraca band.

307
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
 It's Odie.

308
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,320
 It's a little Oatmeal, a little shih tzu scratching on the door.

309
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:07,280
 And she gets up and she opens the back door and Odie comes inside.

310
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,880
 She looks down and she starts petting Odie and Odie kind of growls at her and then runs

311
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
 away.

312
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,840
 She goes, "Odie's kind of a jerk.

313
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,680
 That doesn't surprise me that he didn't want some lovin' plus we locked him outside.

314
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,520
 He's probably a little perturbed by that."

315
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,400
 And then eventually her boyfriend comes down from playing video games and he's watching

316
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
 the movie with her.

317
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
 And she goes, "Oh!

318
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,800
 You left Odie outside when you called in the dogs Odie and didn't come in."

319
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,040
 And Charles looks at Patricia and says, "I don't know what you're talking about.

320
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,000
 Odie definitely did come in with me.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,720
 In fact, when I was upstairs playing video games he was with me the whole time.

322
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,880
 He was sitting on my lap.

323
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,120
 He was actually kind of annoying.

324
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,120
 So I'm trying to play a video game and there's this dog on my lap."

325
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,280
 And they kind of get in a little bit of a tiff about this because she knows for sure

326
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
 that she just let Odie into the house.

327
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,320
 And he's like, "No, I'm telling you.

328
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,720
 I did not imagine this dog on my lap.

329
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,680
 I remember thinking, 'Just leave so I can play this game.'"

330
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,040
 A month or so later there's another incident involving oatmeal.

331
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:15,600
 She says that she woke up and Odie was in their bedroom.

332
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,920
 And she's like, "Great.

333
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 Odie likes to get up.

334
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,560
 He likes to get super hyper.

335
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,880
 And Odie's gonna wake up.

336
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,960
 Charles and Charles, we have a different sleeping schedule.

337
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,800
 So I got Odie out of the room and locked the door so Odie couldn't get back in to bug Charles.

338
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,840
 And when Charles did wake up and everything, the days starting and they were talking to

339
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,200
 each other, she goes, "Why was Odie in the bedroom when I woke up?

340
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,600
 Like I know that he was gonna wake you up if he was still in there."

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
 And he goes, "No, no, no.

342
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,760
 That's not what happened.

343
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,040
 Like earlier in the night Odie was annoying me like he always does.

344
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,160
 And I kicked him out of the room before you even came in to go to bed."

345
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,560
 And she said at this point it was like a half joking, half serious fight, an argument between

346
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,840
 Charles and Patricia.

347
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,240
 She's going, "Listen, no, when I woke up Odie was in the room."

348
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,920
 And he goes, "No, I let Odie out way before that."

349
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,040
 Both of them are very, very clear.

350
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
 That door was shut.

351
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,840
 Odie could have not gotten in by themselves.

352
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,080
 And both of them had to kick Odie out.

353
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
 But at whatever, right?

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,600
 How many times have you gotten in an argument with a friend over something minor?

355
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
 Where did you put my soda?

356
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
 And you guys are arguing about it.

357
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
 I know I put it here.

358
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 No, you put it there.

359
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,800
 It doesn't mean anything, right?

360
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
 It doesn't mean anything at all.

361
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,040
 It definitely doesn't mean that your house is haunted.

362
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,440
 All of these stories were leading up to the last week of March, 2022.

363
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:58,880
 Patricia and Charles hear a horrible whining coming from their backyard.

364
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,320
 When they go out to check, see what it is?

365
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
 They're husky.

366
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,200
 I forgot that was another dog they have that's in the story.

367
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
 They're husky.

368
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,520
 This big dog has a horrible wound.

369
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,840
 Its paw, one of its paws, is almost completely severed.

370
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,400
 They said it was barely hanging on.

371
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
 They took it to a vet.

372
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 They got it fixed.

373
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,800
 But they had no idea what could have caused this.

374
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,880
 They're out there checking the fence, looking for anything that could have hurt their husky

375
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 so bad.

376
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,720
 Because they figured he must have had some sort of accident, but they can't figure out

377
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
 what could have done this.

378
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
 So that happened in the last week of March.

379
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,920
 And then later that week, Patricia and Charles are both in bed.

380
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,440
 The lights are off and they have their backs to each other as they're watching videos on

381
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,160
 their phones.

382
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,160
 Now Patricia, and she's the one who is narrating this story, she is facing the wall.

383
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,920
 And at this point, Odie is in the bedroom, curled up against her feet.

384
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
 Their cat jumps up.

385
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,320
 This sounds like such a chaotic household.

386
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:17,600
 The cat jumps up onto their bed and gets underneath the covers and begins to squirm its way between

387
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,720
 Patricia and Charles.

388
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,520
 So their backs are to each other, there is a gap there and the cat is moving through

389
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
 the bed.

390
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,520
 And it's kind of just nestling in between the two of them.

391
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,280
 Now Patricia, she's watching videos on her phone, she's not really paying attention, but

392
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
 she goes, "That's weird.

393
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,120
 The cat normally likes to lay on top of me and I know that because it totally sucks.

394
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,920
 There's this cat on top of me, I'm trying to do something else, but whatever, it's a cat's

395
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,420
 world."

396
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,760
 Five minutes pass and Patricia hears a quick sequence of noises.

397
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,640
 First off, she hears Odie growling.

398
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,880
 But the growling isn't coming from her feet.

399
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,000
 Oh, never come from her feet.

400
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,840
 It's not coming from oatmeal at her feet in bed.

401
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:12,520
 It's coming from the lump underneath the blanket between her and Charles.

402
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:19,440
 Then she hears her boyfriend yell at oatmeal, begin yelling at their little shih tzu and

403
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 shooing him off of the bed.

404
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,680
 And this little lump, she feels move between their bodies and jump off of the bed.

405
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,240
 Now she realizes now that, again, all the lights are off, they only have their phones,

406
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,840
 she realizes now, "Okay, so oatmeal must not be at my feet.

407
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,560
 Oatmeal must have been between us and the cat's at my feet."

408
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:51,120
 Charles turns on a desk lamp and surveys the situation, sees what the layout of the room

409
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,400
 is, and completely freaks out.

410
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
 Because this is what's going on.

411
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:07,040
 The cat is rolled up into a ball across the room, sleeping peacefully.

412
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,840
 Oatmeal is curled up against Patricia's feet, just laying there.

413
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,720
 And that is when Patricia and Charles have to come to the realization there is another

414
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,600
 oatmeal in the house.

415
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,920
 Actually, I don't know if he had this in his bedroom or what.

416
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:36,440
 Charles pulls out a knife and a flashlight and begins looking around the room for whatever

417
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,280
 was in the bed with them.

418
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,960
 Patricia is asking him what the world is going on and Charles says, "This is what happened."

419
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,240
 Oatmeal crawled into bed with us.

420
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,560
 Patricia goes, "He's at my feet."

421
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
 And he goes, "Yeah, I know.

422
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,240
 Let me finish."

423
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,400
 He crawled into bed with us and I was petting him.

424
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,880
 I was petting Oatmeal.

425
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,520
 I've pet that dog a hundred times.

426
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,400
 I know what he feels like.

427
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,800
 And I was scratching his little bum bum and I was working my way up his back.

428
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 And then when I began to pet his head, it had no fur on it.

429
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,280
 His face was completely hairless and then it bit me.

430
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:33,160
 Whatever it was sunk its teeth into my hand and ran off of the bed.

431
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,880
 I read this story the other day and again with all the stuff you come across online,

432
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
 everything you're looking at, you always got to wonder how true is it?

433
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,720
 It's so easy to make this stuff up.

434
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,560
 And when I read this story, I mean obviously we'll get into the implications of what this

435
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,720
 could be in a second.

436
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,040
 I read the story and I thought, "Wow, this is really creepy, right?

437
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
 Is this some sort of shapeshifter?

438
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,380
 Is it some sort of demon?

439
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,480
 How is reality being distorted in these people's houses?"

440
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,240
 And then Patricia posted an update and I was like, "Uh-oh."

441
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,120
 Because I've read enough of these stories where the update becomes super dramatic and

442
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,000
 all of a sudden Oatmeal's flying around the house and there's like eight of him, "Choose

443
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
 the true one or we will devour you."

444
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,800
 And she's like, "Has a pre-show up, like some hunky stud?"

445
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,600
 So when I saw that she posted an update, I was like, "Great.

446
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,000
 This is where I'm going to know whether or not this story is true or false."

447
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,120
 And what was super interesting is the update mentioned nothing about more dog stuff.

448
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,880
 It was more about sounds and how they were talking to his mother and saying, "Yeah, she

449
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,120
 always felt off in the house and they found this like male drop box that just kind of

450
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
 led."

451
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
 I was like, "No, great.

452
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
 Now is there going to be like a skeleton?"

453
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,480
 I was always worried about finding out that these really interesting stories are fake,

454
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,520
 but the update really added nothing to the mythology.

455
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,440
 It was just more about, "Yeah, the house is kind of creepy and we hear more boot noises

456
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
 sometimes."

457
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,960
 And I was like, "This story might actually be true."

458
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,640
 Because normally people double down on the exciting stuff.

459
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,200
 No one was like, "No, but tell me more about the boots as a dog doppelganger is running

460
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 through the house."

461
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,480
 So that, I was like, "Okay, now we're cooking with grease or is it cooking with fire?"

462
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,680
 Now Leatherface has revved up his chainsaw because I go, "If the update is boring, that

463
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,720
 really lends more credence to the original story."

464
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,320
 So let's look at, so thank you Patricia for sharing this.

465
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
 That's not your real name.

466
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,560
 Thank you Lemsicles for sharing this.

467
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,040
 The implications of the story, they're terrifying because what we're talking about is a demonic

468
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,520
 infiltrator disguised as something that we allow to be close to us all the time.

469
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
 A pet.

470
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,800
 Little animal, little animal people that are hanging out with us, we allow them to sleep

471
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,720
 with us.

472
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,520
 We allow them to eat with us.

473
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,080
 You're like, "Jason, people do that with other people."

474
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,160
 Hold on, you know, let me finish.

475
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,000
 We allow them to go to the bathroom with us.

476
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,200
 Like when you're going on the toilet and your cat comes in, I used to have a cat all the

477
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,720
 time that every time I would go to the bathroom.

478
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,480
 The cat would be banging on the door until I opened it and then he would come in.

479
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 It was super disturbing.

480
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,200
 This cat would always be with me while I was pooping.

481
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,480
 It didn't for whatever reason.

482
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
 It won't...

483
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,520
 Now I'm imagining that it was possessed by some sort of demon or is the reincarnation

484
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,200
 of some sicko with a poop fetish or something.

485
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
 Yeah, it was his cat.

486
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,640
 It was named Tyler Durden.

487
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,240
 I guess when I had that cat.

488
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,560
 I had a cat named Tyler Durden and he would scratch on the bathroom door until I let him

489
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,400
 in and he would sit there while I was pooping.

490
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,720
 And it was super aggravating.

491
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 But it was my cat.

492
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,560
 Now if it was a friend of mine, it was my buddy Josh.

493
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,640
 He's like, "Hey man, I'm lonely.

494
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
 Can you...

495
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
 Can I at least be in there for a couple minutes?"

496
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,240
 And then he comes in and he's like sitting on the bathtub rim while I'm pooping.

497
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,280
 I would have never allowed that.

498
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
 Ever.

499
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,520
 Ever allowed that.

500
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,280
 And with my cat, you know, he's gonna annoy me at the door so I might as well just let

501
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,960
 him in so I can poop in peace.

502
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,200
 But then I'm not even really pooping in peace because there's this giant cat just sitting

503
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
 there.

504
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,760
 It wasn't even like he was watching me poop.

505
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,920
 He was just sitting there.

506
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,200
 He's reading the magazine.

507
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
 He's reading cat fancy.

508
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,480
 But I wouldn't allow a human to do that with me.

509
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,020
 And you allow animals to do things that you wouldn't allow humans to do.

510
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,880
 So if a demon disguises itself as an animal, I almost think that you're more vulnerable

511
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,320
 around it.

512
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,960
 Now on the one hand, you go, "Well Jason, you know, skin walkers and stuff can become

513
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,320
 wildlife and you have the story of the not deer."

514
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,480
 And there's definitely stories of like demons taking the form of like goats and stuff like

515
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
 that.

516
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
 Yeah.

517
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,760
 They're not in my bathroom.

518
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,720
 They're not in my bed.

519
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,420
 If I was walking and I saw like a deer in my apartment, I would be terrified.

520
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,660
 I'd be, so those things are massive and they're all pointy.

521
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,500
 But if it was a little cat, I'd be like, "Come on buddy."

522
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 And then I'd like roll around with it.

523
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 Someone else's cat.

524
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 I'm in someone else's apartment.

525
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,020
 They're like, "Get out of here, you lunatic."

526
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
 Yeah.

527
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:19,660
 It's like you cuddle with these pets and that pet could be a demon.

528
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,060
 And this is creepy too.

529
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,320
 Because you know, maybe if your loved one starts, you know, playing with Ouija boards

530
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,240
 and stuff like that, you'll assume at some point they're going to get possessed and you'll

531
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,560
 be on the lookout for that.

532
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,480
 But you don't know what you're...

533
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,240
 I'm so desperate to come up with an ending for this episode.

534
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,580
 What I'm about to say is just absolutely absurd.

535
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,440
 You don't know what your pets are doing when they leave the house.

536
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,040
 When you open that door or that cat goes out the cat door or your dog's running around

537
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,020
 in the big backyard you have, you don't know what that animal's up to.

538
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,060
 It might be becoming demonic.

539
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,420
 Especially cats, right?

540
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,540
 Dogs, they'll go in the backyard and they can't really go anywhere.

541
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,260
 So if they were building some sort of summoning circle, then you would know.

542
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,100
 But like cats, an outdoor cat, he'll roam the neighborhood.

543
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,580
 You don't know where he's going.

544
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,740
 And every time he walks out that little cat door out front by the end of the night when

545
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:26,480
 he comes to have some kibbles, for all you know, it's not your cat.

546
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 It's not your cat.

547
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,120
 It's like a doppelganger of your cat coming back.

548
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
 You don't know.

549
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,200
 You don't know.

550
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,160
 So yeah, like I'm not saying every time your cat comes back you're throwing holy water

551
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
 on it.

552
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,240
 The chances of you having a possessed cat come back are probably pretty small.

553
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,120
 Actually probably infinitesimal.

554
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,260
 Probably never happens.

555
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,420
 But you don't know.

556
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,460
 And it would be if your cat came back.

557
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,100
 Let me ask you this, man.

558
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
 Let me ask you this.

559
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,460
 When your pet comes back, people who don't have pets already shut off the pockets or

560
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,100
 all I got so you know.

561
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,380
 When your pet comes back into your house, you let your dog or your cat out for a while,

562
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,260
 when they come back, do you check to make sure that it's still your dog?

563
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,380
 Like it looks like your dog, right?

564
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,300
 And it might have the same tag on it.

565
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,100
 So you're like Jason, how was I supposed to tell if that's my dog?

566
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,000
 If it looks like my dog and he's wearing the same accessories as my dog did.

567
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,700
 But spiritually, spiritually is that your dog.

568
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
 We don't know.

569
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,400
 We don't know whether or not that when your animals come back that they're actually your

570
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
 animals.

571
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,360
 And to me, that's spooky.

572
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,200
 To me, that's the idea that you don't know what you're accepting into your house.

573
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
 And in this case, this is a copy of the dog, right?

574
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
 It's a copy of oatmeal.

575
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,980
 So even if your dog comes back in and you're like petting him and then later you go and

576
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,420
 you open the door, you're like, oh, that's and actually now that I think about it, that

577
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
 happens a lot.

578
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
 I've had a lot of people say, what?

579
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,060
 I thought you were in the house.

580
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,820
 What are you doing outside in the little dogs?

581
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,180
 Like, and then you let the dog in the house.

582
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,100
 That happens all the time.

583
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,380
 What if dog or cat doppelgangers are more.

584
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,580
 It's a doppelganger of a goldfish.

585
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,220
 You're like, no, wait a second.

586
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,100
 I know for a fact.

587
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,580
 I only have one goldfish.

588
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:21,120
 But there are clearly two goldfish in this fish tank and then it jumps out and eats you.

589
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,840
 This would be the perfect way to infiltrate a house is what I'm saying.

590
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,320
 If you were a demonic invader, it seems like it would be more trouble to try to imitate

591
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,800
 a human because we know humans.

592
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,640
 We could tell when something goes off with a person, but with an animal, you could probably

593
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
 tell things were slightly off.

594
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
 You're like, that's weird.

595
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,680
 He doesn't seem so interested in his food today.

596
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,040
 But you would also think, ah, maybe he's just sick or maybe I'll just take him to the vet.

597
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,940
 You wouldn't go, oh, it must be a demonic invader.

598
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,980
 You'd actually allow it more access into your house and especially the places where you

599
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,420
 are the least guarded.

600
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,620
 I think a demonic pet could get closer to you and you would suspect it less.

601
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,860
 It would have to do more things for it to catch up to you.

602
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,300
 It would have to do more things for you to actually think this is some sort of demonic

603
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,420
 entity and by then it may be too late.

604
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,660
 Their husky got its foot almost cut off.

605
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
 Right?

606
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
 It was severed.

607
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,480
 It was gone.

608
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,960
 We can only assume that the shitsu did that, that oatmeal too did that.

609
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,240
 So how common is this?

610
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
 How common is this?

611
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,720
 Is there anything we could do to protect ourselves from this phenomenon?

612
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,160
 Because it really is something that unless it did something absolutely bizarre, like

613
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,960
 lose all the fur on its face and bite you, you would still, all of the other things that

614
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,420
 happened they just assumed they were the mistaken ones.

615
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:53,140
 They the humans did something wrong when in fact there were two oatmeal's in the house.

616
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,540
 And if you live in a busy house, if you live in a big house, if you live in a place with

617
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:03,820
 lots of pets and you're not keeping good eye on all of them, this could be fairly common.

618
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,500
 This could be something that happens more than we think because there's nothing that

619
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,360
 demonic entities want to do more than to infiltrate our lives.

620
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
 That is where they have the power.

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,320
 They don't have power just kind of floating around in the ether.

622
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,920
 They want to get into your lives and corrupt your lives and destroy your lives and destroy

623
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,960
 the relationships you have with other people.

624
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,520
 If Patricia and Charles were a less loving couple, these slight disagreements could turn

625
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,640
 into full blown arguments.

626
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,860
 People break up over the dumbest things and they get in huge fight over the dumbest things

627
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,660
 and really these are things like your job is to let the dogs in at night and you're

628
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,660
 not doing your job and this could have become a huge fight.

629
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,780
 This could have broken up this couple all because this demonic entity entered the house.

630
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,300
 And Patricia packs up and she leaves with her pets while Charles is sitting there going

631
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,040
 "I know for a fact that oatmeal was upstairs with me.

632
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,120
 I don't know why she's blown this out of proportion.

633
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,620
 She's just a dumb girl."

634
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,820
 Blah blah blah blah blah.

635
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:16,940
 And as Patricia is driving away, going to stay at her mom's house for a couple days,

636
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,680
 going to try to reassess the situation.

637
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,900
 She knows she's never going back to Charles.

638
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:29,500
 The little shitsue in the back of the car, it smiles, has a little demonic smile in the

639
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,260
 darkness that goes "he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he
