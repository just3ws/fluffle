1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
 A man tormented by his coworkers has a strange effect on the environment.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,440
 And then we take a look at 5G technology.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,300
 Some people say it's a health hazard.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:23,400
 Some people say it will revolutionize data transfers and one person says it is the frontline

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,400
 weapon on the war against the ETs today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:38,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,800
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I had to snip.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
 I'm recording this actually after I did the episode.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
 I had to snip out a quick story in the beginning.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,720
 So if I reference it, if I keep talking about weapons of war, that's just ignore that part

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
 of me on the later episode.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,480
 But everything else ran kind of long, so it snipped out.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,680
 So there might be one or two references still in there.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,280
 And if there isn't, I'll cut this part out as well.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,240
 But enjoy this previously recorded episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,200
 Our first story is, speaking of weapons of war though, let's go ahead and move on to

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
 this next topic.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,360
 Now this next topic, I got out of my favorite book, The National Directory of Homin' Places.

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,800
 And generally when I find stuff in that book, I then go online and try to find some follow-up

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,960
 information or some other references to it and things like that.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,920
 This one is a ghost.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,680
 This one has no information on it outside of the information in the book.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,440
 Which means one of two things.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,720
 The book is wrong, which is heresy, but no, the book may be wrong or the story is getting

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 covered up.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
 And you'll see what I mean here in a second.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,920
 Now in the book of The National Directory of Homin' Places, it will list, it pretty

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,480
 much has every Homin' Place, when the book was written, it was like late 90s.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,000
 Every place that's reported haunted in the United States is in this book.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
 Great assets, it's a great valuable resource.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
 And they listen by counties.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
 So sometimes it's easy for me to confuse because I'm not a county person, I'm a city

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,320
 person, but in all of Oakland County, there's only one haunting.

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,520
 Which makes me think either the people of Oakland aren't very observant to the ghosts

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,120
 around them or ghosts are afraid of Oakland.

39
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,720
 Or the ghosts don't exist and it's all made up, but I think it's one of the first two.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,000
 But in all of Oakland County, there's only one reported haunting.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 From 1964.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So we're going way back, way way back.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,520
 The year is 1964, we're in the city of Oakland and there's this unassuming office building

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
 in Oakland.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,960
 It's the Wheeler and Hullford building.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 So just a very nondescript building, people walking around making phone calls, printing

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,840
 papers, did they have printers back then?

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,440
 People making phone calls, people writing paper on binder paper.

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,880
 I think one of the salesmen has a crush on the receptionist we'll find out next week,

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,800
 but this office just seems to be kind of blah.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
 A standard office.

52
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,880
 But one day one of the office workers just kind of walking around and a huge file cabinet.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,880
 Narrowly almost crushes them.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,600
 It doesn't narrowly almost crush them.

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,520
 He narrowly escapes almost being crushed by this huge file cabinet.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 People are like, what?

57
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
 What happened?

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
 He's like, I don't know.

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,880
 Tune in next week to find out.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,320
 Anyways, they don't have to tune in next week.

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,320
 These file cabinets keep tipping over and almost crushing people.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,480
 Maybe not they're dramatically, they're just tipping over.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
 It's not an obstacle course.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,640
 They're not constantly having to run away from these things, but they are falling over.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,920
 And after that pictures start to kind of fly off the walls.

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
 Like, falling down.

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,800
 It actually said fly off the wall in the story.

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
 That's probably exaggerating a bit.

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,720
 I think they probably just fell.

70
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 We'll meet them in the middle.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
 They jumped a bit.

72
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,160
 Now, there's a lot of stuff going on in this office.

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,720
 You have the falling file cabinets.

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,440
 You have the flying pictures.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
 Jim almost got beat up by Pam's boyfriend.

76
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,960
 And Dwight is looking for the guy who smoked marijuana and you may think, okay great, is

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,760
 he going to make office jokes the whole time?

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
 Well kind of.

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,200
 But it did have a bit of the office type environment here.

80
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,680
 There was a young man who was constantly being teased for being effeminate.

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,360
 This young man was being teased for acting gay.

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,280
 So people are ribbing him.

83
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,240
 People are jostling him.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
 Duncan is head of the toilet.

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,240
 I don't know.

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
 Basically they were probably just calling him queer every day.

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,760
 But he was really, really upsetting this dude.

88
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,100
 But nobody connected the two events.

89
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,120
 Nobody connected this young kid who may or may not have been gay and these giant things

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,240
 almost falling on people and pictures flying off the wall.

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,480
 Phones started ringing out of the blue.

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,280
 Ring, ring, and you'd pick it up and go hello.

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
 Dunder Mifflin.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
 Pam speaking.

95
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,480
 And there would be no one on the other line.

96
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,920
 You'd hang up and the second they hung it up.

97
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
 Ring, ring.

98
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,800
 Big way back up.

99
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 No one's there.

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,680
 The owners of the building call in Pacific Bell.

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,860
 They replace, they test all the lines.

102
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,180
 They can't figure out what's causing it.

103
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,540
 They replace every single phone in the building.

104
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,980
 Ring, ring.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,260
 It won't stop.

106
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,260
 Owners of the building are having city inspectors come in.

107
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,180
 They go why is this stuff falling off the wall?

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,980
 They're like dude that's not our job.

109
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,460
 We don't come in here and test gravity.

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,500
 And they're like oh yeah, yeah, that's not why I called you.

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,780
 And we're also having all these electrical disturbances.

112
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
 Plus the phones.

113
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
 City inspectors are going through it.

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,180
 They can't find the source of any sort of electrical disturbances.

115
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,840
 They can't find any source of what's causing the phone calls and either good packed bell.

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,560
 They do notice an oddly angry, quite effeminate man sitting in the corner going awww.

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,080
 And his frilly pink shirt.

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
 And they don't even pay attention to him.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,000
 They're like is that guy, you think that guy's a little queer?

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,560
 And they're like yeah, yeah probably.

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
 He's on the wrong show.

122
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 He should be on queer as folk.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
 This is the office.

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,280
 And they're like yeah he does appear to be on the wrong network.

125
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
 But they kept making fun of him.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
 All this stuff kept happening.

127
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,860
 Now at a certain point, and it's very vague what happened.

128
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,820
 But in the article it says on June 16th the effects became so violent that owners summoned

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
 the police.

130
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,740
 And they're like that's very interesting.

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,500
 That made me want to look into this more.

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,100
 And there's no information.

133
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,940
 So let's just keep going and then I'll go into what I think happened.

134
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,620
 So the police show up at the Wheeler and Hallford building.

135
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
 And they have no idea what's going on either.

136
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,740
 They end up, one of the police officers says hey listen I know this pair of psychologists.

137
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,560
 He works at University of California.

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
 Let's get him in.

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,880
 Because we don't know what it is.

140
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
 No one knows what it is.

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
 All this stuff's crazy.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,200
 And it is quite scary.

143
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,960
 So Dr. Arthur Hastings came in from Cal.

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,240
 And he comes in and he's doing his investigation.

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,720
 And he sees that gay looking dude over in the corner and he says, well he doesn't do it

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 right away.

147
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,920
 He does full investigation.

148
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,400
 But at the end of the investigation he goes, that guy's the cause of it.

149
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,620
 And everyone turns their heads simultaneously.

150
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,020
 And the dude's like me?

151
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,300
 And they're like yes, you.

152
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,860
 You're the cause of this.

153
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,580
 Now actually to back up, I don't know if he publicly accused him of it.

154
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,340
 But at some point he did tell the police and the owners of the building.

155
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,500
 That guy over there is the cause of it.

156
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 And they're like the queer.

157
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,460
 And he's like well I don't know whether or not he's gay.

158
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,020
 But I've seen you guys really like riding them hard.

159
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
 That's not a gay joke.

160
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,260
 I've seen you guys really really like making fun of him.

161
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,800
 Even when I was here, even when a college professor was here and surrounded by police,

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
 you kept saying derogatory slurs towards that guy.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
 They're like yeah but you know look at the way he stands and his pants.

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
 Yeah, yeah I know.

165
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
 It's a little questionable.

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,320
 But he's the cause of this.

167
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,400
 This is my theory.

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,920
 That the relentless teasing that's gone on.

169
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,040
 Because he just got the job here in January, right?

170
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 January of 1964.

171
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 And they're like how'd you know?

172
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
 And he goes well because I read the entry in the book.

173
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
 National Director of Honor Places.

174
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,580
 But I know he's only been here since January of 1964.

175
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,460
 And they're like that's correct.

176
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,700
 And when did this stuff start?

177
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,740
 And they go this year, a couple months after January.

178
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,460
 So he's the cause of it.

179
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,460
 You're causing him so much psychic pain that somehow, somehow he's releasing that energy

180
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,340
 psychokinetically and making stuff fall around.

181
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,820
 It's his way of getting back at the teasing.

182
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,860
 Now there's only one way to really test that scenario.

183
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,080
 It doesn't say whether or not he was fired or he quit.

184
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,280
 But he shortly left after this investigation.

185
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,160
 And the places never had any activity after that.

186
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,480
 He left, everything went back to normal.

187
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,080
 Pam and Jim got married.

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600
 And had a couple babies.

189
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,480
 Everyone lived happily ever after.

190
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,280
 Except for this unnamed guy.

191
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,840
 So I go there has to be more information on this.

192
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
 We have the police involved.

193
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,280
 We have a prominent parapsychologist involved.

194
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,060
 And he is a very prominent parapsychologist, especially at that time.

195
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
 He's involved.

196
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,220
 You have a named building.

197
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
 You have a year.

198
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,220
 You have specific dates.

199
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,220
 There has to be some information on this.

200
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
 Looked around online.

201
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
 I couldn't find anything.

202
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,380
 Couldn't find any anecdotes that specifically didn't come from this book.

203
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,100
 No news articles, anything like that.

204
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:07,060
 Now it would seem like this should be somewhere in the realm of paranormal research because

205
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,800
 we have specific dates, specific times, specific addresses, a prominent paranormal researcher

206
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
 and a conclusion.

207
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
 It's not just like no one knew who threw the cabbage.

208
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,960
 Like it actually can point at what caused it.

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,120
 So why is this story not known?

210
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
 Well I have a theory.

211
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,160
 It's not known because it's been covered up.

212
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,000
 You recruit this young man.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,520
 Obviously you recruit this guy.

214
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,200
 Now it does suck for him that it seems like his power, because it is a power to be able

215
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,760
 to throw desks around and make pictures fly off the wall and make phones irritate people.

216
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,800
 Those are definitely superpowers.

217
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,820
 But you know how Shazam has to say Shazam to become Shazam.

218
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,420
 This guy has to be called gay and homo all day long before his powers can start working.

219
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,260
 So double edged sword.

220
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,620
 On the one hand you do get to become a superhero and fight for the forces of good.

221
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,400
 On the other hand you are relentlessly mocked for being acting like a chick.

222
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,800
 And imagine if you go to the Justice League.

223
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,600
 You have Batman's area and you have Superman's area.

224
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,800
 But your area is just constantly defaced with pictures of buff dudes and you're like "I

225
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 swear I'm straight.

226
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 I swear I'm straight."

227
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 Superman's like "Uh-uh."

228
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 Yeah right.

229
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,840
 And they're doing it because that's the only, I mean they kind of question it, but at the

230
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,320
 same time that's the only way they can get your powers to work.

231
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,820
 So you would never know if people honestly believed you were gay or if they were trying

232
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
 to help you out.

233
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,180
 Are they bullying you for a good cause?

234
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,260
 They change his outfit to be Wonder Woman's outfit.

235
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,340
 He's like "Come on guys, please."

236
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,260
 But then while he's like sad that everyone's picking on him, he's moving mountains with

237
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,160
 his mind.

238
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
 Double edged sword.

239
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,420
 I don't know if I would have left to have superpowers in real life.

240
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,260
 But if my superpowers involved people constantly harassing me, that's the only way I can get

241
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,320
 superpowers is if the population of Metropolis was constantly trolling me, that's the only

242
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 way I could save them.

243
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,120
 I don't know if I would take that deal.

244
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,000
 This dude might have though.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
 This dude might have.

246
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,680
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

247
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,240
 Now our next story is actually a request in a browned about way.

248
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,200
 So there's a YouTube user named Hate.

249
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:30,220
 And Hate said you need to look into the health concerns involving 5G, the new cell phone rollout

250
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,220
 system.

251
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,100
 Wi-Fi rollout system, however you want to classify it.

252
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
 5G health concerns.

253
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,060
 And Hate sent me a ton of links, at least 20 different links regarding this.

254
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,380
 Now I'm going to put them in the show notes.

255
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
 I looked at a few of them.

256
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,100
 I appreciate the request Hate.

257
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,420
 This was my thing.

258
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,760
 And this was one of the things, I looked at a couple of them and I said, "Of course,

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,480
 there's health concerns with 5G."

260
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,920
 It was one of those stories that, it was one of those conspiracy theories that I kind of

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,680
 looked into a while back and I was like, "Of course there's going to be health concerns

262
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
 with it."

263
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 And I'm not diminishing the request.

264
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,160
 I really do appreciate the request Hate because I did go on a different route with this.

265
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,380
 This is one of the things, sometimes people will request things that are fairly popular

266
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,660
 and this one is a fairly popular conspiracy.

267
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,020
 And I'll say, "If I can find a good spin on it."

268
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,540
 Someone will say, "Hey, have you thought about doing the Manhattan Project?"

269
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,020
 Or, "What's the one with the Philadelphia experiment?"

270
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,740
 And I'll be like, "If I can find a new spin on it, I'll do it."

271
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,380
 So that was the thing with the 5G thing.

272
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,420
 I saved the email or saved the notations, got all the links, looked through a couple

273
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
 of them.

274
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,880
 And I filed it away and I said, "If I can find the new spin on it, I'll do it."

275
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,080
 Because this is a lot of people are covering this.

276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,520
 But at the same time I'm thinking, "Of course it's probably going to cause health problems."

277
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,560
 I'd be shocked if it didn't.

278
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,640
 I'd be shocked if it didn't make bees go haywire or birds to start banging butterflies.

279
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,960
 Like it's going to do something because we're introducing a millimeter waves into the air.

280
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,720
 Now millimeter waves are what they use in the airport.

281
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,840
 Micro waves, which is generally I believe what's used for 4G.

282
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,500
 They don't penetrate your skin, but the millimeter waves will penetrate your skin.

283
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,700
 So probably going to have some health problems with that.

284
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,140
 We need more of them because they don't go as far as traditional cell towers.

285
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,940
 They're going to need to be, they say like one for every 20 homes, which is incredibly

286
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
 close.

287
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,220
 They're going to be just all over cities.

288
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,180
 So yes, I looked through a couple of the resources and each time I pulled something up I said,

289
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,180
 "Well yeah, of course.

290
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,300
 Of course you should be concerned about this."

291
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,960
 I don't think there's really anything people can do about it.

292
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
 They were having a couple cities that have said, "We don't want it.

293
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
 We're not going to roll it out."

294
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,080
 But I'm sure in five years they will because they'll be so behind in their internet speeds

295
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,040
 and stupid stuff like that.

296
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
 I'm sure that 4G is not good for us.

297
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,800
 I'm sure that just cellular phones in general aren't good for humans or for society.

298
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,680
 Like not society like a mental thing.

299
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,560
 Like I'm saying, I don't think it's good health-wise.

300
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
 Alarm clocks can give you brain cancer.

301
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,580
 And studies dispute that.

302
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,100
 Studies dispute all sorts of stuff.

303
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,980
 Some studies say that no, 5G is totally harmless and other doctors would say, "Let's be cautious."

304
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,580
 But what I want to talk about is the spin on it.

305
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,060
 Because again, that's all fairly well-known stuff.

306
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,340
 And thank you, Haight, for the recommendation because you took me down a really cool story.

307
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,140
 Probably not the story that you wanted, but I think that was the answer to your question

308
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,740
 as far as 5G health concerns.

309
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,500
 Yeah, I think it does.

310
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,800
 I think those health concerns are very...

311
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 It's good to have.

312
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 It's good to have those.

313
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,440
 But what I want to talk a little bit about is the disinformation.

314
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,400
 Because I don't believe in predictive programming.

315
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,320
 I've talked about that before, but I do believe in controlled opposition.

316
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,480
 I do believe in disinformation.

317
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,040
 I believe that when you have a group of scientists or a group of citizens saying, "We think 5G

318
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,680
 is unhealthy," if you really want to make them look like weirdos, you throw a weirdo

319
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,660
 out there to say, "Well, it also causes suicides."

320
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,740
 And everyone's like, "What?

321
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
 Don't listen to that guy.

322
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,940
 Don't listen to that guy.

323
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,340
 We want to talk about legitimate health concerns and how it may be affecting prenatal development.

324
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,380
 And you know, a bunch of people killed themselves around a 5G town.

325
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
 What?

326
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,540
 No, go get that weirdo out of the room.

327
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,580
 Because actually, that was the first...

328
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,020
 When I first heard about the 5G stuff, it was linked to suicides.

329
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,860
 And I'm like, "That's ridiculous.

330
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,660
 That is not true.

331
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
 That's not true."

332
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,560
 Now, of course, someone can say, "No, no, no, look at these links."

333
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
 But here's the thing.

334
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,120
 I'm willing to entertain and believe the fact that you don't want millimeter waves flying

335
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,640
 everywhere through the sky.

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,040
 Because we don't know what they do to us.

337
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,160
 We don't know what they do to the environment.

338
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,640
 I'll look at that information and I'll go, "Yeah, probably."

339
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,960
 But then once you start giving me information that is nonverifiable, I was like, "This is

340
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 nonsense.

341
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
 It's controlled opposition."

342
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,080
 So when people go, it has legitimate health concerns.

343
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,500
 People can go, "Yeah, and some people believe it causes suicide.

344
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 Look at these wackos.

345
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 Don't listen to these wackos.

346
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,060
 I think it's controlled opposition."

347
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,700
 Because I kept reading the suicide thing.

348
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,260
 "Ah, it's causing people to commit suicides.

349
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,540
 It's causing people to kill themselves."

350
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,620
 I'm like, "That's just not true.

351
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
 That's not true."

352
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,460
 Probably will mess with your tummy.

353
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,340
 It may affect pregnant women.

354
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
 I don't know.

355
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,100
 But it's not making you jump off a cliff.

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,900
 But there's another more spectacular thing.

357
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,560
 Now this might be classified as controlled opposition against controlled opposition.

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,200
 We are in the rabbit hole now.

359
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,960
 We're going into the looking glass, guys.

360
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,640
 Because now we have the true reason why 5G technology is being rolled out.

361
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,840
 And it's good.

362
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,720
 It's spectacular, even.

363
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,680
 There's this guy named Cliff High.

364
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,920
 He's an older man and he has something under his belt called Webbot.

365
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,040
 We'll get to that in a second.

366
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,860
 But he recently released a video saying that 5G is not for cell phones or for Wi-Fi.

367
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,540
 It is actually a...

368
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,180
 Well, actually, let me say this first.

369
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,980
 He believes that there's this AI type algorithm constantly trolling the internet.

370
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
 And you have to...

371
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,460
 When you speak about stuff, like stuff that's sensitive, the truth, you have to say beforehand,

372
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,460
 what I'm talking about is for entertainment purposes only.

373
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,820
 It is a lark.

374
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,840
 It is no more than if I was describing a video game to my friend.

375
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,360
 This is not educational.

376
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,080
 This is simply a way for me to discuss a gaming event with a friend.

377
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,160
 And he goes on and whenever he starts talking to something, he's like, "Okay, now before

378
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,760
 I address that topic, I would like to remind the algorithm that we are simply playing a

379
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 game."

380
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,120
 So I've never met anyone so technologically paranoid before.

381
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,500
 Like, he almost believes that the right combination of code words, his videos won't get demonetized

382
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,020
 and I don't think that it's that.

383
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,840
 I think he almost thinks that this algorithm is like hunting people, which if that was true,

384
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,600
 my Erratus episode would have completely demolished the show.

385
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 Any episode I've done would have completely got demolished the show, because I'm always

386
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,260
 talking about weird stuff, but after letting us know that this is just a video game and

387
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,800
 no one's going to get hurt and none of this information is true, he then begins to unravel

388
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,100
 this huge conspiracy in very, very serious tones.

389
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,780
 Aliens can happen million people a year around the world, and the people who are being replaced

390
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,620
 are alien hybrids.

391
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,420
 They're slowly replacing us the way that we replaced the Neanderthals.

392
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,940
 Here is an actual quote from him.

393
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
 Space aliens.

394
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,640
 Now anyone who ever uses the word space and aliens at the same time, there's just something

395
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,980
 so cheesy about that or something so 1950s about that?

396
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,740
 Space aliens can control our minds.

397
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,460
 They can actually control the neural pathways in our brains and they can do so such that

398
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,340
 they could eliminate me from your vision.

399
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,620
 I could be sitting there and I could be coughing and hacking and they decide what you will

400
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,940
 hear and see of my presence.

401
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,340
 And they can do this relatively easy.

402
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,940
 They are able to control our brains through their inbuilt telepathic abilities.

403
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,620
 But, and I added the but.

404
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,780
 This he didn't add the but.

405
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
 This continues.

406
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,500
 The 5G network could be used in my opinion to disrupt the ability of the hybrids to

407
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,100
 control human thought.

408
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,540
 So it may be that in order to have a free mind in the future, we have to live in 5G envelopes

409
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,260
 in order to be relatively free from being screwed with by the space aliens as they proceed

410
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,100
 with their evil plan to conquer Earth.

411
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,660
 Tell me that doesn't sound like a delusional old guy from the 1950s.

412
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,140
 It's like the War of the Weirdos with this one.

413
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,060
 Because he's definitely pro 5G.

414
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,060
 He wants it.

415
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
 It's the only way to stop the aliens.

416
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,740
 But then you have the other people claiming it causes people to go mentally insane.

417
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,420
 And of course, again, the normal people and the people who just want a reasonable debate

418
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,580
 about the scientific issues are caught in between these guys.

419
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,780
 But what's really telling about Cliff High, what's really telling about this guy, is that

420
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,380
 despite his fear of the algorithm coming after him, he actually harnesses the algorithm to

421
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,460
 be able to predict the future.

422
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,420
 Now he created, so maybe he does know a little something about what's coming with the 5G.

423
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,780
 Because he created this thing called Webbot.

424
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,460
 What it does is it constantly searches the internet for terms.

425
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,180
 All sorts, and the amount of the words being used and the way they're used, the emotion

426
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,500
 they're being used.

427
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 He developed this Webbot to play the stock market.

428
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,620
 So he could figure out trends that were coming in the stock market, be able to buy and sell

429
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,740
 all that stuff.

430
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,700
 But then he thought, if it can predict the stock market, which it might be able to,

431
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
 honestly.

432
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,860
 I mean, if it's just trolling all the information out there, you might be able to say, "Everyone's

433
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
 talking about Coke.

434
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
 I'm going to buy stock and Coke."

435
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,700
 All these tweets are positive about Coke and negative against Pepsi.

436
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
 "I'm going to buy some Coke stock."

437
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,140
 Or vice versa.

438
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,660
 So that could work.

439
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,100
 But then he starts to get into this hippie-dippy nonsense where I can actually predict the

440
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
 future.

441
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,060
 These are the things that it's predicted.

442
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,140
 Predicted the northeast blackout of 2003, and all the power went out over there.

443
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,940
 Predicted the boxing day tsunami, that big earthquake that killed a bunch of people,

444
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,700
 like 100,000 people, and almost wiped out the time machine on North Sentinel Island.

445
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
 Predicted Hurricane Katrina.

446
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,940
 And you ask, how can web terms predict natural events?

447
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,780
 I don't know either.

448
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,740
 He also predicted massive pull shifts during 2012, you remember that.

449
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,260
 Also predicted the massive earthquake that hit the Pacific Northwest in 2008.

450
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,580
 I remember that.

451
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,980
 I actually had just moved up here then, and it was just bodies everywhere.

452
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
 It was shocking.

453
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,900
 I mean, I'd come from California and lived through a couple earthquakes, but that earthquake

454
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,660
 in 2008 that killed 10,000 people in Hood River, it was amazing.

455
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,740
 So thank you, Webbot, for warning me of that.

456
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,460
 Also predicted, and you guys should all remember this, the dollar collapse in 2011.

457
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,580
 Remember when the dollar was basically worth pennies, and the Obama administration almost

458
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
 faced the junta.

459
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,820
 I mean, it was a huge, huge time in 2011.

460
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,660
 I'm surprised any of us are still alive from that.

461
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,700
 So those are some of the predictions that the Webbot has made.

462
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
 So it sucks, basically.

463
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,740
 But what's fascinating about this guy?

464
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
 Absolutely fascinating.

465
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,020
 Other than his bizarre theories on the algorithm trying to take him down, and 5G fighting aliens,

466
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,620
 they're just space aliens making hybrids that are whatever.

467
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,940
 Oh, also he thinks that the United States has already been taken over by aliens.

468
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,060
 So I think right there that should tell you his view on President Trump, and that Russia

469
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,340
 and China are viewing America as a possible threat.

470
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,660
 We might already be absorbed into the alien empire.

471
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,860
 Why we are then rolling out 5G technology?

472
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,980
 He never explains.

473
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,660
 So his Webbot thing.

474
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,140
 Now you go, Jason, I want to know the future.

475
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,940
 I want to know what fake calamity is going to happen to me next.

476
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,180
 And I do too.

477
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,020
 He puts out a report that shows all the terms and how they're interpreted and what the predictions

478
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
 are going to be.

479
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
 Now they're quite vague.

480
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,020
 Some of them are vague.

481
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,460
 Some of them can be a little more specific.

482
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,860
 But with this list of terms at the very least, you'll probably get good stock market tips.

483
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,460
 And in the most, you may be able to avoid the next 2012.

484
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,660
 Now what cool thing about it is that the reports are free.

485
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,900
 No, that's not true.

486
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,640
 There are $100 each.

487
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,460
 So for the low, low price of $99, you can get a list of words that are super vague and

488
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,500
 nobody can really interpret.

489
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,860
 And you know, you could also, $99, $99 for a list of words.

490
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,180
 I'll do that for $10.

491
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,660
 I'll give you a list of words every month.

492
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,340
 You pay Palmy $10.

493
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,740
 Now you may go, Jason, that's a little harsh.

494
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,460
 You haven't seen the report itself, but I've seen something more telling than the report.

495
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,020
 This is one of those things that I just kind of stumbled across.

496
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,760
 It's almost like Sherry Shriners biography on her own webpage, where she basically explains,

497
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,920
 we did those episodes a while back, but she basically formed this religious mission.

498
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,240
 And then on her biography, she gave away like some weird clues as to why she did it.

499
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,920
 And I don't think she realized it.

500
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,240
 On Cliff High's website, he has a short story he wrote.

501
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,920
 And I first started reading it and thinking it was an actual article about something that

502
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,480
 somebody had done regarding all of this stuff.

503
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,620
 He has a short story that he wrote.

504
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,020
 This story, this is so bizarre.

505
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,780
 I can't believe that he put this on his front page.

506
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,900
 The story was written in 2018.

507
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
 It's called Escape This Life.

508
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,460
 It starts off with this young man named Brett.

509
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,660
 He's in a coffee shop.

510
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,780
 He's drinking coffee.

511
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,500
 He's on the dark web.

512
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,460
 And he's watching porn at a coffee shop.

513
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,740
 And as you do, I guess, but that's, see, I don't even like researching this show at a

514
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,740
 coffee shop.

515
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,020
 I'm always afraid what someone's going to walk over my shoulder and see like just nuns

516
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,080
 covered in blood as I'm reading about some zombie story or some haunting somewhere.

517
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,160
 And there's just like a picture of a little girl covered in blood.

518
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,240
 I'm really, really sketched out just researching this show in a coffee shop.

519
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,640
 Anyways, Brett is watching porn in this coffee shop on the dark web.

520
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,960
 And he sees an ad for this thing called Escape This Life.

521
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
 And he's like, goes to click on it.

522
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 He can't click on it.

523
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,760
 It keeps jumping around the screen.

524
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,960
 Every time he's like, refreshes it, it's in a different place.

525
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
 It's super bizarre.

526
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
 I'm like, what is going on here?

527
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,660
 At this point, I'm realizing it's not a true story.

528
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,780
 I thought it was a true story when I started it.

529
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,140
 Anyways, he's trying to click on it.

530
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,320
 And then he realizes, I'm going to say this guys, do not type this into a browser because

531
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,680
 for all I know, this will take you to somewhere really, really gross.

532
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,960
 But because I don't know what this cliff dude's up to.

533
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,060
 But anyways, in the story, Brett finally realizes, I can't click on the ad, but think

534
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
 about it.

535
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,100
 He types in escape this life.onion.

536
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,660
 Now, dot onion is the how you surf around on the dark web.

537
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,780
 You don't use dot com or dot biz or dot gov.

538
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
 It's dot onion.

539
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:37,200
 Now, I don't know if they actually have like a URL like that.

540
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,240
 I thought it was just a stream of numbers, but apparently this is escapeyourlife.onion.

541
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,240
 Again, don't type that in because I don't know what it is.

542
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
 Escapeyourlife.onion.

543
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,960
 He types it in and he sees this ad and it says, "For the sum of $1 million in Bitcoin,

544
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,120
 other payment vehicles available, ask your time travel booking agent for details.

545
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,460
 This escape this life corporation will bring you forward in time to Utopia on Earth and

546
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,660
 will also clone you in your current condition and time leaving your clone behind so that

547
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,020
 your friends and family need never know you left them.

548
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,260
 Escape all your cares and responsibilities living in Utopia on Earth a mere 102 years

549
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,420
 from your current year while having them all lived through just as you would have by your

550
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
 clone."

551
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,380
 Please contact this escape life corporation for further details should you qualify and

552
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,220
 wish to escape your life.

553
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,900
 And he's like, "Oh, that's great."

554
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
 So I'm reading this and I'm like, "Oh, what is..."

555
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,840
 Okay, I guess I'm reading a short science fiction story now.

556
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,540
 And he goes, "Yes, I do want to escape this life.

557
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
 I am a millionaire.

558
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,220
 I could easily pay a million dollars.

559
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,820
 I have more than that."

560
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,180
 Since I'm the grand champion of the VR panplanetary games, I'm like, "What?"

561
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,380
 So whoa, whoa, whoa.

562
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,580
 So half way through the story, I find out he's already in the future.

563
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,280
 So this story starts off with him in a coffee shop watching porn on a laptop.

564
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,180
 And now it turns out that he's some sort of like shroud, but instead of Fortnite, he's

565
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,480
 playing VR in the panplanetary game.

566
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,820
 So now we're already in the future.

567
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,260
 So now I'm super confused.

568
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,820
 I have no idea what's coming up next.

569
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,060
 We find out that his wife is a total hag and she's just constantly nagging him.

570
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,660
 She's almost a veiled Kim Kardashian.

571
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,540
 And I'm not saying that Kim Kardashian's a hag, but this author might think she is.

572
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,820
 Because she's basically like this money-grubbing, celebrity-obsessed trophy wife who basically

573
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,380
 is taking over his life.

574
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,380
 So now I'm imagining Kanye West watching porn in a coffee shop and also playing VR games

575
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,620
 in the panplanetary competition, whatever the hell that is.

576
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,100
 So he then decides that he wants to escape this life.

577
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,180
 So he types in, "Oh, oh, so that's all the information that's available on the website."

578
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,940
 He goes, "Well, how do I escape this life?"

579
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,620
 And then he sees at the bottom where it says, "Escape your life."

580
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,060
 And he goes, "Uh-huh."

581
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,700
 He types in, "Escape your life.onion."

582
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
 And nothing happens.

583
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,340
 Then he goes, "Wait a second, wait a second."

584
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
 Escape.

585
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,940
 "Who's life do I want to escape?"

586
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
 "Huh?"

587
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,660
 He types in, "Escape my life.onion."

588
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,260
 And then a video pops up and there's this guy named Trey and he's like, "Hello, Brett.

589
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
 It is I.

590
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
 We knew you were coming.

591
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,460
 It is I from the future.

592
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,740
 So I'm going to tell you a place where you go and we'll take you into the future and

593
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
 we'll clone you."

594
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
 You're thinking, "Jason, why are you telling us this story?

595
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
 Trust me, it pays off."

596
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,220
 You're like, "Why are you telling us this sea level science fiction story?"

597
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,260
 So Trey is like, "You come to this warehouse and we'll clone you and then we're going to

598
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,660
 send you into the future and your clone will stay here.

599
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,300
 And your clone's going to get a little tap-2 on the inside of his lip of three colored

600
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,900
 circles on the inside of your lip.

601
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,180
 And then your clone will stay here and you'll go into the future."

602
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,740
 And Brett's like, "Yippee."

603
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,580
 So this episode's totally gone off the rails so I'm just going to go with it.

604
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,500
 Brett goes to the warehouse.

605
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,460
 And there he meets Trey's clone in the past and he's like, "Hey, I'm Trey's clone.

606
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
 What's up?"

607
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,380
 Because like this cool handshake, Brett can't get it right.

608
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,380
 "I don't know.

609
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
 I just...

610
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,700
 Trey, how many white guys do you know named Trey?

611
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,220
 And how many white guys do you know named Brett?

612
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,380
 They're all named Brett.

613
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,220
 Anyways, doing the handshake, Brett keeps messing it up.

614
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,580
 Trey's like, "I got enough money to buy a hundred balls."

615
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,620
 And Brett totally doesn't get the reference and Trey's like, "Whatever."

616
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,220
 Trey then shows his lip and shows that he has the tattoo on his inside of his lip and

617
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,300
 he goes, "Hey, I'm a clone."

618
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,180
 From the past or from the future or whatever.

619
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,180
 I'm here.

620
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
 It doesn't matter.

621
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,180
 Give me a million dollars.

622
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,220
 And then you're going to get on this table and we're going to clone you and then we're

623
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,380
 going to send the other one into the future and then your clone's going to be left here

624
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,420
 and you'll be in the utopia.

625
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,620
 And Brett's like, "Oh, okay, cool, man.

626
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,300
 It's funny because when I read the story, the name Trey didn't even register with me,

627
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,980
 but now I can only picture him as like a skinny black dude.

628
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,220
 Anyways, Brett gets down on the cloning table and there's other people kind of milling about

629
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,700
 and stuff like that.

630
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,220
 And then the next thing he knows, he goes under and the clone wakes up.

631
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,460
 Now the clone wakes up and Trey's standing over him and he goes, "Well, you're in the

632
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
 future now.

633
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,260
 They're really using the future and you're the clone and you can go about living the

634
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,460
 life how you want."

635
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,480
 And Brett goes, "Oh, this is awesome.

636
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,660
 So what do I have to do?"

637
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,700
 Trey's like, "Really, you can do anything.

638
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,060
 You're responsible for your own actions, but you really don't have any responsibilities

639
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
 because you're just the clone."

640
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
 And he's like, "Yeah."

641
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,380
 And he feels the tattoo on his upper lip.

642
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,340
 And then he goes, "Okay, I'm gonna go home and bang a couple strippers in front of my

643
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
 horrible wife."

644
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,140
 And Trey's like, "Hey man, you be you."

645
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,420
 And Brett leaves.

646
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,860
 And then Trey basically turns to the camera and goes, "Uh, the fool.

647
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,020
 We don't have a time machine.

648
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:38,620
 We simply gave him a tattoo and told him he was a clone, all for a tidy sum of one million

649
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,620
 dollars."

650
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,100
 Oh, those rubes getting ripped off on the internet.

651
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 They'll believe anything.

652
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,060
 Now, those aren't his exact words, but that's the intent.

653
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,180
 He basically goes on to say, "Yes, there's no time travel involved.

654
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
 This is a scam.

655
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,980
 They take this from country to country and they just rip people off for a million dollars

656
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,740
 and then they go off and do whatever and they'll never find them again."

657
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,620
 There's a couple problems with that story.

658
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,980
 One, it's really hard to find scam.

659
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,700
 If it's a scam, why did he make it so difficult to find?

660
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,420
 Why didn't he just say, "Go to this web address.

661
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
 The video will pop up right away."

662
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,580
 Why didn't he make them click on a bunch of stuff?

663
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,220
 Secondly, the story is written by Cliff High.

664
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,780
 If you're running an online scam in real life, don't write a science fiction story about

665
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,600
 a guy who runs a scam online.

666
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,180
 If you're basically telling people for a hundred dollars a month, I will give you vague

667
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,620
 predictions of the future.

668
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,660
 Do not then put on that same website a story about a man who rips people off a million

669
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,980
 dollars at a time to tell them they're going to the future.

670
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,860
 I've never... it is... it was so Freudian.

671
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,460
 I was just scrolling through to see if he gave a free sample of some of his predictions.

672
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:56,060
 Instead, I find this story that is basically him admitting to committing fraud.

673
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,220
 Because he's not Brett in the story.

674
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,620
 He's not the grube.

675
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,180
 He's not the guy who gets fooled and is banging strippers in front of his wife.

676
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,020
 He's the guy taking the money.

677
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:09,340
 It's absolutely bizarre that that's on the front page of his website.

678
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
 Absolutely bizarre.

679
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,220
 Now, what does any of that have to do with 5G technology?

680
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,100
 Like I said, it went off the rails a bit there.

681
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,740
 But let me wrap it up like this.

682
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,140
 5G technology probably not very healthy in the long term.

683
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,500
 Controlled opposition is a real thing and I think that as we see the health debates for

684
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,340
 5G technology continue, they're going to get weirder and weirder.

685
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,740
 And that's not because more evidence is going to be revealed, it's going to be because controlled

686
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
 opposition.

687
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,660
 Third, never trust a man who writes fiction about a scam he's currently running.

688
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,660
 Now, again, let me clarify this too.

689
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,020
 By me saying that it's a scam, I'm not... if you want to pay... scam might be too harsh

690
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,020
 of a word.

691
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,540
 If you're dumb enough to pay $99 for a list of vague words and terms, there's no different

692
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,980
 than someone going to a psychic.

693
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,020
 Like yes, I believe most psychics are scams and fortune tellers and stuff like that are.

694
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,140
 But I mean to watch Cliff High is going to try to sue me or something like that.

695
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,980
 If you want to waste your money on this stuff, go ahead.

696
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,540
 I don't necessarily think he's committing any sort of criminal acts, but he's definitely...

697
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,860
 it's fishy.

698
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
 It's definitely fishy.

699
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,900
 A fact that I've won.

700
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,740
 The fact that he basically admits to it in fictional form.

701
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,180
 I mean listen, if you ran a home security business and you sold security alarms and

702
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,540
 you wanted to include on your webpage an article about a guy who breaks into a house and rapes

703
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,020
 and murders a family, that would basically be a selling point.

704
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,820
 Because you would be like, "Well, now I definitely want a security alarm."

705
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,340
 But if you run a few cell security alarms and then you write a story... first off, why

706
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,740
 is there a fictional story on this website?

707
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,460
 But if you ran a security alarm company and you wrote a fictional story about a guy who

708
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,020
 sells security alarms to people and then knows the codes, goes into the house of the people

709
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,500
 who just bought your security alarm and rapes and murders them, you should expect people

710
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,220
 to be a little suspicious of your business.

711
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,860
 So when you are selling me information from the future and then you write a fictional story

712
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,140
 about a guy ripping people off involving the future, I'm going to be suspicious.

713
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:24,260
 And I may call it a scam and that may get me in some hot water.

714
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:30,100
 But at the very, very least, the very, very least, it's really bizarre.

715
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,740
 Unless that story is set up to be controlled opposition.

716
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,540
 And if someone ever goes, "Are you scamming us?"

717
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,780
 He goes, "If I was scamming you, why would I write this delightful story down here?"

718
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,540
 And they're like, "Hmm.

719
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
 Good point, Cliff.

720
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
 Good point.

721
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
 Here's a hundred dollars."

722
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
 And he turns away slightly.

723
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
 He's still with an earshiny.

724
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
 He goes, "Oh, that Rube.

725
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,540
 Oh, that Rube."

726
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
 And they're like, "What'd you say?"

727
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,060
 And he's like, "Oh, nothing.

728
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,900
 Please step into my cloning booth."

729
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,740
 I love, I love doing this show.
