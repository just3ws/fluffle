1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Is it possible that the cheapest fish is not the healthiest fish to eat?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Who could it be?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we kick off UFO Disclosure Week.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 With a bizarre story that was randomly put out on the web and has led me deep down a rabbit hole.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Is it possible that grey aliens aren't coming to Earth to invade and enslave humanity,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 but are coming to raid our freezers today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I had a great vacation and thank you for everyone who wished me a well vacation,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 whether you sent it an email or you just wished it.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 You're sitting there, you found a four leaf clover.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You're like, "I hope Jason has a great vacation."

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I did. I watched. I did nothing.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I didn't do any research.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Most of you can tell I didn't answer any emails or respond to any comments.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I was shut down, but it was great.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I watched 79 movies because that's what really, that's one of my main passions is movie watching.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I love watching movies.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And we're gonna, I found a lot of great ones.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We're gonna be doing a lot of Dead Rabbit Recommends for a while actually.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I found some really, really good movies, but thank you.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 It was a needed vacation.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 It was very, very refreshing.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And this is, this kind of came up out of the blue.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 This week is UFO Disclosure Week.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 One of the stories I wanted to talk about that happened while I was on my vacation was those New York Times articles.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I found some interesting stuff reading through.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 There's two articles. A lot of people think there was only one.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 New York Times did a follow-up article.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And it's some weird stuff going on.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And so we're gonna be building up to it.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That's gonna be our Friday episode.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But this week is gonna be all about UFO Disclosure, people coming forward, talking about UFOs.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Some weird UFO stories.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Stuff I normally talk about.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But now it has a theme.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 A lot of you guys joined the Patreon while I was on vacation.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But I haven't been able to do shout-outs.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 KOTA 119.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 KOTA 119.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Thank you so much for supporting this show.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 It really, really helps out a lot.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You're gonna be our navigator, our pilot, our captain this episode.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Whatever vehicles we use.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand that.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Talk to your friends about it.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Post about it online.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 All of that stuff really, really helps out a lot.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And I'm still sending out supporter stickers.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So if you haven't gotten your sticker yet, you still need to prep it.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then pretty soon, hopefully, I'll have them all out by the end of the week.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Like I said, I haven't been doing anything for three weeks.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I want to reveal the design of the sticker.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I know I've been talking about that a lot.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So KOTA 119.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Let's start off in the Jason Jalopy.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Now, we're gonna be driving around.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Now we're not really headed anywhere in particular.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 We're just wasting gas driving around in circles.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But while we're driving, I'm gonna pull out my phone.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I'm gonna put on a little nighttime cap.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Like, if you have any old-timey shows or cartoon strips or in real life, I think they had them too.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 You know, the pointed cap with the ball.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Put on my pajamas.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And we're driving on the road.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 The reason why I'm giving you that little introduction is that I have this --

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 A couple people know this.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I think I might have mentioned it once or twice on the show.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Every night before I go to bed, when my night light's on and I'm snuggled up,

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I go to Reddit.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I don't boomie yet.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I go to it every night.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I go to the meth subreddit.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Now, I've talked about --

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Meth is the number one --

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 If you look at, like, episode three or four of this show, I've talked about meth.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I've had a lot of dealings with meth addicts in my life.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Whether it's encountering them in the wild on the streets

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 or having family members, extended family members, using meth.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It's a horrible, horrible drug.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's the drug that, for whatever reason, most aligns with the world of paranormal.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 You don't see many heroin users doing heroin and then going into a haunted house.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I mean, they're basically just like --

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They do.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 They go in to fall asleep.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And they're like, "There's ghosts trying to wake them up."

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And the ghost just kind of shrugs his shoulder, walks away.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I used to be subscribed to the meth subreddit, and it would pop up in my post or whatever my main page.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And I --

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Half of the time, I thought I was on looking at something from a paranormal subreddit.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 It's a lot about shadow people, cameras coming out of the walls, all sorts of stuff.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I found this story the other day on the meth subreddit.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And let me just read you this post in full.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Because this post, while small in and of itself, opened the doorway to a conspiracy I never knew existed.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 You might have --

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And at that point, this segment's a waste of time.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 But I never heard of it.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You might have.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Kota119's Tav and his watch.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I know, I know, I know.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 That was a long intro, but I haven't done this in a month.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I'm a little rusty.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Kota, we're driving.

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 We're going to go through this tunnel.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 We're going to go through this tunnel.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And now we're outside this dude's house, which is not a good place to be outside of a meth user's house.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 The blinds are perpetually split open.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 You see little eyes looking out.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I know they're out there.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Some old jalopy pulled up.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 This is a Reddit post.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I just ate some fish.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Oh, a mystery, right?

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 How could you not click on that?

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I just ate some fish on the meth subreddit.

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So, you got to click on that, right?

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Here is this post.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Quote.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So I just made three jalapia fillets right from the store with some peppers and brown rice and queen -- queen-wa?

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Queen-ya?

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 You know what I'm talking about.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's the rice.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 It's the, like, uh -- it's -- it's -- it's some edible substance that I can't pronounce.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And I didn't do any meth today, but after eating the fish, I have the most rock -- okay, kids, leave the room.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Leave the room, okay.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I know that was the -- you're at the end of your seat.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 What happened when this meth user ate fish?

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And how does this relate to conspiracies or true crime in any way?

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I didn't do any meth today, but after eating the fish, I have the most rock-hard pee-pee boner.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I've had since the last time I did meth.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I can't get boners with meth, so obviously -- this is -- this is why I love these subreddits.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So, let me sum up the picture.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 We're in the -- we're outside this guy's house.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 We see this dude, he sits down, he just bought some tilapia, and he's eating it, and then, like,

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 comically, baboring a noise of a spring launching, and he looks down at his pants, and then he -- uh?

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So, he has the most rock-hard pee-pee boner.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I'm not making that -- you know, I don't really cuss on the show.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'm not making that edit.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He actually typed it in as a letter P, letter P.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 The most rock-hard pee-pee boner I've had since the last time I did meth.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I can't get boners with meth, so obviously -- obviously, right?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 So, obviously, someone drugged me, or I drugged myself subconsciously.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Can someone please help?

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And after this medical problem, he ate three tilapia, he has the biggest boner -- oh, sorry, rock-hard pee-pee boner --

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 he's had since the last time he did meth, and he pleads for help.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Then, this is the next sentence.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 "Also, let me know how my crackback looks."

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And that's a meth term when you smoke with a pipe, the meth, like, shatters or something like that.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It makes these weird little designs.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So, he says, "Normally, I don't get boners, and I haven't smoked meth, but maybe I drugged myself.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Maybe -- obviously, that wasn't the only two options.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I drugged myself subconsciously, or somebody drugged me, a.k.a. let me know how my crackback looks."

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Oh, and to let you know, there's no photo of his crackback.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It's an emoji of the planet Earth with the meridian lines.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So, I don't know if he thought he posted a photo of his crackback, but it's not.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 It's just an emoji, anyways.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 What does any of this have to do with Dead Rabbit Radio?

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I mean, technically, it's true crime, right, because it's illegal, but I'm not --

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I have tons of meth stories, actually.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I've been dying to fit into this show, and that I found on the subreddit.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And a lot of times, behind the scenes, I talk to other people before I record stuff, and they're like,

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 "Don't do a segment on meth burps?"

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 No one wants to hear about meth burps.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I'm like, "But it's a conspiracy."

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Anyway, now that Kota is trying to hotwire the car and drive all of you out of here, no.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 No. Let me tell you why I'm covering this, why I'm covering this.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So, did you know?

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 One of the comments to respond to this dude was this.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 It was from the notable scientist CokeDoutBuba.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 CokeDoutBuba, Dr. CokeDoutBuba, wrote this, "Talapia is not a real fish.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's made in a lab. It gives you cancers and has tons of Omega-6 conspiracy."

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 That's why we're here, Kota 119.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 You have to repair my car.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I didn't know this. I didn't know this.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Now, what he said is technically true. This is bizarre.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Kota, let's fire up that dead rabbit, Durgible. The car is inoperable right now, anyways.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 We're going to fly around. We're going to visit a couple of fish hatcheries.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Exciting stuff for a paranormal conspiracy into your grand podcast.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It's funny because there's a lot of debate.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "Is Talapia bad for you?" Everyone agrees it is, but the question is how bad is it for you?

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 It's really weird. I was actually, obviously, like, I investigate.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I solve this and I go, "Oh, is that true?"

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Even when I'm reading a meth subreddit, I'll go, "Oh, I wonder if that's true."

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 We don't know why this guy had a rock-hard peepee bone.

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 That mystery will never be solved.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 But not by us, at least.

191
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But I look at that and I go, "I wonder if that's true."

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So, Talapia is...

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's funny because some people say it's worse than bacon.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Eating Talapia is worse than eating a rat.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And there are... The scientists have come out and said, "It's not great for you."

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It's not great for you. It's not as...

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 It's not as unhealthy as eating bacon.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They go, "That's a common that gets bandied around a lot."

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And they said, "You can't really make a comparison between a Talapia and a rat."

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 That should send off alarm bells because they don't automatically say,

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 "No, it's not. There's gone apples and oranges."

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So, Talapia is a wild fish.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 A lot of people believe it's 100% genetically modified.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You can actually find it in the wild.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 But the fish you eat is genetically modified.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You can go fishing.

207
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We went to the Mediterranean and the Morocco, stuff like that.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 You can find Talapia in rivers.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It is a real fish.

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 But the fish that you eat is genetically modified.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It's the cheapest fish.

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 It's like $2 a pound or something like that.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 That's why you'll find it in boxes of like Gordon Fishermans and stuff like that.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It'll be very, very cheap stuff.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 But as far as the health concerns go, they say,

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 "Listen, it's not great for you. It's not technically as bad as bacon."

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 The problem is that the way it's raised, not just the genetically modified way,

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 but what we feed it.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Talapia is a fish that will eat anything.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 You throw some...

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 In America, they use soy.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And our fish hatcheries, they dump soy into the tanks.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The fish apparently make that noise.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 They eat up the soy, and then you kill them, and then you eat them.

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And you're basically getting soy in the shape of a fish.

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 That's not fair.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Technically, a cow's not grass in the shape of a cow,

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 but you're eating a fish that's been fed on soy.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 In China, they dump manure into the water.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 They kind of slow down.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 They don't want to eat it as much, but it's all they can eat.

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 A lot of times, they dump manure into the water.

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 They eat it.

234
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I mean, it's basically one hand cleaning the other.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 You have a pile of manure here.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 You have a bunch of hungry fish here.

237
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Why not?

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Well, it's disgusting.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And you would go, "Oh, then I'll just eat.

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I'm American.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I'll just eat American bread and talapia."

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 The problem is that 73% of the American talapia comes from China.

243
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So if you're eating talapia, you're probably eating a Chinese cow's poop.

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I mean, really, if you think about it.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Now, there have been pushes to stop that practice where you're eating.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 They're feeding the poop to the fish, but, you know, it's cheap.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And the fish is cheap anyway, so they could --

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I was reading this one article, and they're like,

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 "Well, if you really want to eat talapia, go out and fish for it."

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And I'm like, "Then I'll eat a salmon at that point.

251
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I'll eat a penguin if I have to go find it."

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Talapia -- I can't remember the last time I ate talapia.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I know I'm not eating it again.

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So, is that all, Jason?

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Did you really talk for 20 minutes about this?

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Well, no, because it's not just --

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Yeah, kind of, but no, it's not just that.

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 The fact that talapia is most likely the talapia you ate

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 was born into a tank filled with poop,

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and then ate poop until it matured and then was pulled out of the tank.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And someone goes, "Yep, that's perfect.

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 This is just totally fine for humans to eat."

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 It's also because they live in a lot of poop,

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 which -- and now they have to think about it, not even rats.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Not even rats eat poop, so you might be better off with rats.

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 They actually get gross viruses, a shocker of things, right?

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They actually get pretty gross viruses.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But not just that.

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 In Bellevue, Washington, November 10th, 2016, there was this woman.

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 She's like, "Mmm-mm-mm, she hasn't heard this episode.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 This podcast didn't exist at the time."

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And she's like, "Mmm, talapia, my favorite food.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Ooh, straight from China. Yum, yum, yum."

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And she's cutting the fish up,

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and then she cuts her finger and it bleeds.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And she goes, "Ow! She's not Superman."

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 So, of course, that's what's gonna happen.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 She goes, "Ow! My finger.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Oh, well, I'll just keep cutting this fish.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 What could possibly go wrong?

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Later that night, uh, uh, it's not for me and the talapia.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Uh, her finger is throbbing.

283
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Uh, that's not normal.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And so she goes to the hospital.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 She's diagnosed with Vibrio vulnificus.

286
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And it's a blood infection, basically.

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And it's rare for humans to get it,

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 but there have been quite a few cases of people getting it

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 in Washington, actually, from different stores,

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 different fish stores, when you're eating this talapia.

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 They say the symptoms range.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 This is quite a big range.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 They range from vomiting and diarrhea

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 to skin ulcers and fatal blood poisoning.

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 That's a big range, right?

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 See, guys, you had so little faith in this segment

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 in the beginning, you're like, "Man, this guy's really gonna read

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 about a dude's boner while he's not doing meth but eating fish."

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And from that single post, I might have saved your life.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 At the very least, I might have saved your tummy

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 from eating a Chinese cow poop.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If we're lucky, right?

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Because it just says "Manure."

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Can a human produce manure,

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 or is manure a specific type of farm animal poop?

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I don't know.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 The point is, is that I was able to tell this story.

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 On the first episode coming back from my vacation,

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 let's go ahead.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 This is probably gonna be a long episode,

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 because that went on a little bit longer.

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But I hope that saves you from getting a fatal blood disease.

313
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 There we go.

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Public service announcement.

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I have a quick Dead Rabbit Recommendance.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 It's one of the episodes I saw on my vacation.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I'm not gonna talk about it long,

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 because I think it's best not knowing anything about it.

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The Rental.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 The movie is called The Rental.

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's directed by Dave Franco.

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Came out this year.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It stars Dan Stevens.

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 That's why I watched it.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I don't know who the dude is.

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 My mom's a big fan of his.

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I was watching movies with my mom.

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Dan Stevens, he's from Downton Abbey.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 He was from The Guest.

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So I guess they do know who he is.

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Brie Larson or Allison Brie?

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 One of the two is in it.

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I don't know.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And then two other people.

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And then that's it.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 That's all I'm gonna tell you about the movie.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 If you say I hate those actors, watch the movie.

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 If you say I'm not gonna tell you, just watch the movie.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I knew nothing about it other than I go,

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "Hey, look at Dan Stevens is in this movie.

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Mom, you wanna watch it?"

342
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And she was like, "Yeah, sure."

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's not a...

344
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I actually don't want to even tell you the genre.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I really knew nothing going into it.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 But the fact that if you listen to the show,

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I wouldn't waste your time with the story of Atticus Bomb.

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And it's like some coming-of-age story in 1984, Alabama.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I'm not gonna waste your time with that.

350
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The rental, watch it.

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Don't watch the preview.

352
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Don't read anything about it.

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 If you already know stuff about it, I'd still watch it.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 But yeah, the rental, that's my first recommendation.

355
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And that should tell you out of 79 movies that I watched,

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 that would be the first one I'd recommend, the rental.

357
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So check it out.

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Very, very...

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Hats off to you, Dave Frankum.

360
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our main story.

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 We're leaving behind the rental...

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It was actually filmed in Oregon, actually.

363
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I'll tell you guys that much.

364
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So we're leaving behind, we're waving goodbye to the two people.

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 The one actor I know, the one person who may be two different women

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 and then two other people I don't know.

367
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We're waving goodbye to them.

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 We're waving goodbye.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 They sit down to a nice meal of tilapia.

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I'm like, "That's the worst thing that happens to them tonight."

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 They'll be fine.

372
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Let's hop in the carbonicopter.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Coda 119.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Let's get that whirly bird fired up.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 We are headed out to the middle of nowhere.

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 We're going to some very specific places this episode.

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 [imitates explosion]

378
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Oregon coast, the waves are slowly crashing against the dirt.

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 The beach is what's normally called.

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Blind away, beautiful.

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It is a very, very well-shot movie.

382
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Again, congratulations, Dave Frankum.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 We are headed out to the middle of nowhere.

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 I was on the export today.

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 This was actually not the story I had planned.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'm recording this on Sunday, August 2nd.

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And I had another story planned, and I came across this

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and I got so excited about it, I just was like,

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 "Okay, we got to move.

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I had to shuffle stuff around.

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It may be building it up too much,

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 but this might be one of the most bizarre...

393
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Again, I don't want to build it up."

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 So, I was on the export today,

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and I had a bunch of bookmarks, as I normally do,

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 as going through stuff.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 One of the ex-topics was cool alien lore.

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Post some interesting lore about aliens.

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Now, a lot of the stuff I hadn't come across before,

400
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 but one thing kind of popped out at me,

401
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 and I kind of chuckled and I kept scrolling,

402
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 and then I thought, "If I did it for the Tlapia story,

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 let's do it for this."

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 There was a post on the export that said,

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 "I don't know if this is valid lore,

406
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 but I read some alien report that asserted

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 they like strawberry ice cream,

408
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 or at least they find it interesting."

409
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It's funny, I looked at that.

410
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Kind of chuckled, kept going.

411
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Then I thought, "That's something that's easily verifiable,

412
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 in a sense.

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Like, I'll Google it,

414
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and it'll either pop up with no results,

415
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 it'll pop up with three results,

416
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 or it'll pop up with a hundred results."

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Shockingly enough, I wouldn't say a hundred results,

418
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 but I did not have a hard time verifying

419
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 that this is actually a piece of alien lore.

420
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Code 119, the reason why we're in the middle of nowhere is technically,

421
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 we are in the Midwest United States,

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 which is the American version of the middle of nowhere.

423
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 [imitates flying]

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Helicopter's flying over.

425
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 This story comes from a man known as Scott Arbuckle.

426
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 He's a young adult, he's a normal adult,

427
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 but he writes young adult books.

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 He recently had a book out called Scavenged,

429
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 about a young boy, young man getting abducted by aliens,

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 and all that stuff you can find on Amazon.

431
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 But in his page where he was talking about scavenge,

432
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 he tells a story that when he wrote his book,

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 one of his friends as a gift,

434
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 brought him an origami UFO-shaped thing,

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and some strawberry ice cream, and he kind of chuckled it himself,

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 because he remembers when he was a little kid,

437
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 he had seen on television, you guys are like,

438
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 "Jason, the chain of custody with these stories is weird,

439
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 because it is almost like a friend of a friend,

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 but as we get closer to the source,

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 they're going to get a little more legit,

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 but bear with me here."

443
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 This author, this author watched the television show

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 when he was a kid, he doesn't remember the name of the television show,

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 he said it was like Unsolved Mysteries,

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 but he said he watched it as a kid.

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 This is the story that the television show told.

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 (carpenters flying over)

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The Midwest United States.

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 There's a woman, she's living in a farmhouse

451
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 in the middle of nowhere,

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 she's sitting there one night,

453
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 and there's a bright light.

454
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 (car engine revving)

455
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Her house is shaking.

456
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 (car engine revving)

457
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And it stops.

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Now that's obviously going to get you out of your chair, right?

459
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 She gets out of her chair,

460
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 and she runs outside to see what it is.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And when she opens her door,

462
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 there's two gray aliens standing on her porch.

463
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Now of course she's freaking out, right?

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But the gray aliens just walk right by her.

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 (humming)

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 They have themies apparently.

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Supposed to be the sound of their footsteps,

468
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 but he became more like a rhythm.

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 They walk into her house.

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 They pass by her, they'll get out of the way, lady.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 They walk into her house,

472
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 they walk directly to her freezer,

473
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 open it up,

474
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 pull out a carton of strawberry ice cream.

475
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 (chewing)

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 The two aliens take turns eating it.

477
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I'm assuming they're just using their hands.

478
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Now that I'm like, staying this story out loud,

479
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 they're just eating it.

480
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They throw the empty carton on the ground.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 They turn, they walk out of her house,

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and then just kind of disappear.

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Now we have this author named Scott Arbuckle,

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 who is a fiction author.

485
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He's writing this story on his page that's selling his books.

486
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Is it possible that Scott Arbuckle

487
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 is the guy who posted it on X

488
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 that I actually just out this guy?

489
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Well, because right there we have that,

490
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 but like I said, there were dozens of sources

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 about strawberry ice cream and gray aliens.

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 In the comment section on Scott Arbuckle's site,

493
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 a person told this story.

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Apparently at some point, again, a lot of these stories are vague,

495
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 but we're going to get closer and closer to the source

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 where this stuff could be coming from.

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 This one guy says, funny that she told that story,

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I had heard that when aliens, gray aliens specifically,

499
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 were on Earth, they were at a military base,

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 and they were going to be there for a while.

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It was like a meet and greet thing, just hanging out.

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 These weren't badly injured gray aliens from Roswell

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 holding their guts in.

504
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 These were aliens sitting in a green room just hanging out.

505
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The military official said, bring all our food.

506
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Let's see what these dudes eat.

507
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They're going to be here for a while,

508
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 they have full access to it,

509
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 they're not holding their stomachs in

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 until we bring them Taco Bell.

511
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Right now, they're fine.

512
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Right now, they're as healthy as we think an alien can be.

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 When all the food was presented in front of these gray aliens,

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 they devoured the strawberry ice cream, all of it.

515
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 I don't know if they were then pounding their hands on the table.

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 More ice cream, more ice cream.

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But the idea was that in this secondary event,

518
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 it was the strawberry ice cream they liked the most.

519
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 The LA Times ran an article in 1993,

520
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 it was written by Roy Rivenberg.

521
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 He was covering the ultimate UFO seminar.

522
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 This article was called "Unusually Fanatical Observers"

523
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 so like a play on UFO.

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Roy Rivenberg wrote this article when he was covering

525
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 the ultimate UFO seminar.

526
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 He has this passage in his article,

527
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 "Other extraterrestrials, according to informed sources here,

528
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 give away their true identity by consuming

529
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 mass quantities of strawberry ice cream and green jello."

530
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 So we're seeing these different statements,

531
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 being this one was written in 1993,

532
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 the Scott Arbuckle is fairly recent,

533
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 his book just came out in 2019,

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 but he's saying he watched the show when he was a kid,

535
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 there was no source or no timeline for the aliens

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 of the Air Force base.

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But then we come across a clip on YouTube.

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 This was, I don't have a time period for this,

539
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 this seems to be from the 90s.

540
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 This person you're going to hear speaking was a US Air Force

541
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 representative from Nellis Air Force Base.

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And he was speaking before the Nye County commissioners meeting

543
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 at the Bob Rudd Community Center,

544
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and the videos and the show notes,

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 he's on full view, you can see who he is,

546
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I don't have his name,

547
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 but let me play you this clip when he's giving this presentation.

548
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 We have commissioned a study,

549
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 now part of it gets difficult

550
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 because there are some of the capabilities on the range

551
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 that I will never be able to share with you.

552
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 There are some of them that they don't share with me,

553
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 how I like to tell it to folks is,

554
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I don't talk myself to the aliens,

555
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 I talk to people who talk to the aliens,

556
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 they come to me and they say,

557
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 the aliens like strawberry ice cream,

558
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and I go buy the strawberry ice cream,

559
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 and I come out to local commissions and say,

560
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I'm buying lots of strawberry ice cream.

561
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 So is it an inside joke?

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I mean it sounds funny, right?

563
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It sounds funny.

564
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It sounds like disinfo, right?

565
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It sounds like almost like, so the term little green men,

566
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 you don't hear it much anymore,

567
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 but growing up, you know, I'm 43,

568
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I turned 44 next couple months,

569
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 turned 44 in a couple months,

570
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 but growing up in the 80s,

571
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 mostly 80s and 90s,

572
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 the term little green men was used all the time,

573
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and it was a way to just talk down

574
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 to people who believed in UFOs.

575
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Oh, you can see those little green men,

576
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 it was the same way that people used to talk down to alcoholics,

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 by talking about seeing pink elephants.

578
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You don't really get so drunk you ever see pink elephants,

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 that was like an ongoing joke.

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 If the term little green men was a way to just kind of hand wave away

581
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 people who believed in UFOs, you don't really hear it much.

582
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 People take the subject more seriously.

583
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 New York Times is running articles on it,

584
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 so that'll be an interesting episode on Friday,

585
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 but is it something like that?

586
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Is it something that was just made up so people,

587
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 and it never really caught on?

588
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 It was a meme that didn't catch on.

589
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Maybe the government was like,

590
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 well, let's just start saying that grays eat ice cream,

591
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 and then reporters could go,

592
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 "What do you do, just eat a bunch of ice cream?"

593
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You know what I mean?

594
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Like, it could be a new thing.

595
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So when anyone ever says they saw UFO,

596
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 "Well, you better check your strawberry ice cream."

597
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Is it possible that that's what this was,

598
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 and it just didn't catch on?

599
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It didn't catch on.

600
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Because by the time of the--

601
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 really by the time of the X-Files,

602
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 the term little green men fell out of favor.

603
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 People started taking UFOs and aliens more seriously.

604
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I'd say that happened in the late '80s, early '90s,

605
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 which, yeah, would be around the time of X-Files,

606
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 the book communion, and stuff like that.

607
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 So is it possible that that's what this was?

608
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Well, let's look at the source of this.

609
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 This is really interesting.

610
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I'm going to give credit to a website called ghosttheory.com.

611
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The guy who was writing this article named Henry Patterson

612
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 found this video, found this YouTube video.

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It's from a television show that came out in 1988,

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 so it would be around the time that the term little green men

615
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 was falling out of favor.

616
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Stuff was being taken more seriously.

617
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 In 1988, there was a television show called UFO Cover Up Live.

618
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It was a combination of journalists,

619
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 the guy who hosted the show was from MASH,

620
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 who probably had a passion for the subject

621
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 that he could have also just been,

622
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 "Hey, we know how to talk on camera.

623
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Let's put you in front of the camera."

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's about an hour and 20 minutes long.

625
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And in this program, it's basically the host

626
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 talking to these journalists,

627
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 and they have two insiders, Condor and Falcon.

628
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And in the program, they say,

629
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 "We have verified the credentials of these people."

630
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Like, the producer has met with these people.

631
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 They've seen documentation that these people

632
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 are who they say they are.

633
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 We're not going to show you their face,

634
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 and we're going to change their voice.

635
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 But trust us, these people are actually legit insiders.

636
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 These guys work for the intelligence community.

637
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So that's how this is put forward.

638
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 In this clip, we hear Falcon.

639
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I'm going to play you this clip from Falcon.

640
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 They have a religion, but it's a universal religion.

641
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 They believe in the universe as a supreme being.

642
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 The aliens enjoy music.

643
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 All types of music, especially ancient Tibetan-style music.

644
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 We asked about their diet.

645
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 They do eat vegetables.

646
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 They like vegetables.

647
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And their favorite dish or snack is ice cream,

648
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 especially strawberry.

649
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Well, the next time you're in an ice cream parlor,

650
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 just quietly notice who orders strawberry, okay?

651
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So that is in 1988.

652
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And Henry Patterson, who, again, great find on this,

653
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 he says this is the earliest reference

654
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 he could find to a reference to aliens and strawberry ice cream.

655
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And it's in his article called Aliens of Strawberry Ice Cream

656
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 on his website, ghosttheory.com.

657
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 This is actually, people have talked about strawberry ice cream

658
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 being related to Roswell as well,

659
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 but he goes, there's nothing that he could find

660
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 earlier than this 1988 clip.

661
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Now Scott Arbuckle, the author who said he saw the show

662
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 when he was a kid, I don't know how old he is now.

663
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 We don't know how long ago, like, we don't know what the show

664
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 that was, we can't verify any of that.

665
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So right now we have to say 1988 is the earliest mention of this.

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 The show continues.

667
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 That happened about an hour and 15 minutes in.

668
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And an hour and 20 minutes in,

669
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and he was talking earlier, but there is a journalist,

670
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 a very respected space journalist.

671
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 He's not writing articles in space, he's writing articles about space.

672
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 His name is James Oberg.

673
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 He's considered an expert on the Russian and Chinese space programs.

674
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He worked for 22 years as an engineer in NASA, space engineer in NASA.

675
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 In the same program, so Falcon has now made this claim.

676
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He made the claim about alien religion.

677
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 He made the claim about strawberry ice cream in that clip.

678
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And then let's listen to James Oberg's answer to...

679
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 kind of response, kind of this is towards him, the show wrapping everything up.

680
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 This happened so many times in Soviet Union,

681
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 they released official scientific reports from the Academy of Sciences,

682
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 claiming that things that people see, which happen to be weapons tests,

683
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 space weapons tests, for example, are UFOs.

684
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 So to call them flying saucers and to present that point of view

685
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 is actually to take part in the cover-up of their true nature,

686
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 which is in some ways a very ironic feature.

687
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Now in terms of whether or not these are real UFOs,

688
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 whether or not the MJ-12 stories, which seem to change every time we hear them from Falcon,

689
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 are true, I'm afraid we don't have a 900 number.

690
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But I suggest people go out and do it, go out and buy strawberry ice cream.

691
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 If it's all gone, maybe the UFO guy will go away.

692
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Great.

693
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Thank you very much gentlemen for being here.

694
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 It's funny because the host of the show made a snide reference after Falcon had told that story.

695
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Later on, just a few minutes later, James Oberg also kind of makes a joke about it.

696
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Well, if we wanted to feed the aliens, just buy up all the strawberry ice cream in town.

697
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 The very first time that this story is reportedly told, two jokes are made about it.

698
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Now people do make jokes about UFOs all the time.

699
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It's interesting because we have the date that that video came out

700
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 and we have the LA Times article in 1993, and he's claiming people say

701
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 that this is a thing, people who say that they know.

702
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So between 1988, if we claim that's the first time it was used, in 1993,

703
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 it already grown in the community.

704
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 What's weird is that I've never heard of this.

705
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Now that doesn't mean it's not the all-seeing god, but I doubt any of you have ever heard of it.

706
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 This guy on the export had heard of it, and I appreciate that.

707
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I appreciate that you brought this to my attention.

708
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I find it fascinating because it's all about myth-building.

709
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 There's two things to this story.

710
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 One, is it true, and two, the myth-building aspect of it.

711
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Between 1988 and 1993, we have it starting to become common knowledge in the UFO community,

712
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 but between 1993 and now, I've been researching all of this stuff since I was 12,

713
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 but really on a "amateur/professional level."

714
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I've been doing it every day for two years now.

715
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I've never come across this.

716
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Even from 12 to 43, I've never heard a whisper of this.

717
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Then in the past two years, I'm consuming mass amounts of information every day related to this,

718
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 still haven't come across this.

719
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I would assume, I would be shocked if a lot of you guys have heard this as well.

720
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But apparently, between 1998 and 1993, it was a thing, and then from 1993 to now,

721
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 it's not why.

722
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 What happened to this information?

723
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Why is it so scattered?

724
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 You can find a lot of references to it, but there almost are like little islands in a sea of information.

725
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 There's not a lot of connections between them.

726
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 There's an author named Nick Humphreys, and he wrote the UFO guide,

727
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 and he is able to find out who Falcon was.

728
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Because now we're years and years later.

729
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Falcon apparently, according to Nick Humphreys, Falcon was a man known as Richard Dory.

730
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 He worked at Kirtland Air Force Base.

731
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 He's worked on books.

732
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 He was a contributor to the book Exempt from Disclosure, which was a book about aliens, black book projects, stuff like that.

733
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 He worked at Kirtland Air Force Base.

734
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 He had a lot of different roles there.

735
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 One of the roles he had, so we're going to assume that this is Falcon.

736
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And Nick Humphreys has done his homework, and he's connected Falcon to Richard Dory.

737
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 He is this Air Force Base dude.

738
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 One of his jobs that he says that he did at Kirtland Air Force Base was disinformation agent.

739
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It was his job to spread lies about the UFO community.

740
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Fascinating stuff.

741
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Fascinating stuff, and that would play in to that theory that it was just a way to just kind of diminish it.

742
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Disinformation is an art form.

743
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 You have to be able to say something that sounds realistic enough that people will continue to pursue it, but isn't.

744
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 It's more than just lying.

745
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Richard Dory is now exposed.

746
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Now he's saying, "I'm no longer a disinformation agent.

747
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 I used to do stuff behind the scenes to discredit your movement.

748
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Now I'm not that person anymore.

749
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I'm telling the truth."

750
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And you have to decide whether or not you believe him now, or if it's just a continuation of his Disinformation Act.

751
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 We don't know.

752
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But one of the things that he still claims is true.

753
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 He goes, "No, no, no. That wasn't disinformation."

754
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 That was true. That was true.

755
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 It was a strawberry ice cream thing.

756
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 So it's like, it's this box of riddles that we keep uncovering.

757
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And really that's all of this paranormal stuff.

758
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But you don't see a lot of disinformation in the Bigfoot community, or the Ghost community.

759
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 It's always centered around the UFO community.

760
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 There's really, as far as we know, there's not a government group out there that's trying to trick people into thinking wrong things about ghosts,

761
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 or wrong things about whether or not the boogeyman exists.

762
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Like, the government doesn't care about those things.

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 But the government makes a concentrated effort to trick us, to mislead us on whether or not UFOs are real.

764
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 That's not a conspiracy theory.

765
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 There are tons of docu- reams and reams and reams of documents where they're like,

766
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 "Just tell people at Swamp Gas we want to make people who report UFOs feel so tiny that people stop reporting them."

767
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 That's not a conspiracy theory.

768
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 There's not a bunch of people sitting around the Pentagon who will be like,

769
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 "We convince people that this cemetery is haunted, but not this cemetery. That's a cemetery that's really haunted.

770
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 We convince them that's normal, but this other... They don't do that. They don't care."

771
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So UFOs just have so many other national security implications, but you have people who work in disinformation.

772
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 That's their job.

773
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And then when they go rogue or get free whatever term you want to use, do you then believe them?

774
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Or is part of your disinformation career is to do that? Is to then go out and say, "Oh, I made all that stuff up, but all this stuff is new and real."

775
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 But that's just more of the disinformation. It's a riddle within a riddle within a riddle.

776
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And what's even more bizarre is this riddle is so obscure.

777
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Why would you continue if it didn't catch on?

778
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 If it didn't catch on at all, why would you continue to say that it was true after your mask has been revealed?

779
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 It's so bizarre it could be true.

780
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 I think the biggest question about... If it turned out that they... Falcon also mentioned they love vegetables, so those are lame.

781
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 But if it turned out like if you saw a bunch of alien reports and they're talking about aliens eating,

782
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 aliens love the good old fashioned steak, and that's why they abducted cows all the time.

783
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 That's not weird because everybody loves steak, except for India and vegetarians.

784
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 But you know what I mean? Strawberry ice cream is so specific and it's gross, right?

785
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 It's like the grossest ice cream. It's ice cream with chunks of fruit in it.

786
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Sometimes you can just get strawberry ice cream and it's just strawberry ice cream.

787
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 But for whatever reason, like Neapolitan has just regular strawberry ice cream,

788
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 but if you ever buy strawberry ice cream, there's always chunks of frozen strawberries in it.

789
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And it's gross. You're trying to trick me. You're trying to trick me into eating fruit.

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I'm not going to do it. It's so specific and it's so gross.

791
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And it sure may be you like strawberry ice cream, but that means you're some sort of freak alien hybrid.

792
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I hate to break it to you guys, but strawberry ice cream is gross.

793
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I'd say probably just on the top of my head.

794
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Because I'm obviously losing. This episode is going so long.

795
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I mean, I would guess. I would guess that only... This is how we wrap my episode up.

796
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 I had all that great research. I had all that great research this time wrapping it up.

797
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Off the top of my head of a man who's sweating in a 90 degree apartment recording a podcast.

798
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Off the top of my head, I would say somewhere between 10 to 20% only.

799
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 I don't think that's probably high ball in it, but prefer strawberry ice cream over other ice creams.

800
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 If you offer them chocolate vanilla or strawberry, I honestly think it'd be less than that.

801
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 If you had to get 10% and you would go, "Mmm, strawberry!" as their giant melon shaped heads are barely concealed with a baseball cap.

802
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I would say it's very small, right? And then if you add in the 31 flavors, bro, if you're talking straight,

803
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Baskin Robbins or Ben & Jerry's dude, strawberry is not even in the top...

804
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 There's 31 flavors. It's not even in the top 30.

805
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 I would eat pralines and... That's not true.

806
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Okay, strawberries better than pralines and cream. My point is, is that it's weird.

807
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 It's a fact that's so weird because most humans, most humans according to my non-research,

808
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I probably could research that, most humans don't even like it.

809
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 So it's such a weird detail to come up with. Now, it's possible again that it's a disinformation thing.

810
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 It's a part of being a disinformation agent. You've got to put a little bit of the truth in to tell the lie.

811
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 That's the same thing when you're lying to somebody, lying to your significant other.

812
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 You're talking to another. Where were you last night? You go, I was out. That part's true.

813
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Shopping, that part's true for a present for you.

814
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 And then you find something in your living room and you wrap it real quick behind your back and you hand it to him.

815
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 You got to get a little bit of the truth in to the lie.

816
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 It's possible the strawberry ice cream is one of the real truths that was used to flavor up the lies.

817
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Unfortunately, it's a very bland flavor. Where am I going with this?

818
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Nowhere for the rest of this episode because this will actually be continued, yes, in a very, very interesting way tomorrow.

819
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Because when I was researching this, like I said, dozens of small articles about this, small references to this.

820
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 But I came across an article from a man who said his father worked for the military and was abducted by aliens.

821
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And while he was on this alien spaceship, not only was he told to feed a grey alien a strawberry push pop, but the aliens explained their religion to him.

822
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And when I say aliens, I'm not talking just the greys. This man stood before greys, Nordics, reptilians, all these other races.

823
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 And they explained to him the key to the universe. This man's story has nothing to do with the story of Falcon.

824
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 This story has nothing to do with this era of disinformation. But it touched on two key points that Falcon himself said in his speech.

825
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Strawberry ice cream and an alien religion. And how do we know that this story isn't part of the disinformation?

826
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Well, according to this man's account, his father had told this story of alien abduction and nobody believed him.

827
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 The son even had a hard time believing him until they were watching a program in 1988.

828
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And Falcon says on television, "The aliens believe in religion and they love strawberry ice cream."
