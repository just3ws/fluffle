1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
 A child's wonderment when faced with the unexplained,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,400
 reports of red lights,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,400
 and people disappearing,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 are setting the paranormal community abuzz,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,300
 and...

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,800
 and do nuclear bombs really exist today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
 "I'm a little freaked out, actually I'm a lot freaked out,

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,400
 so me and public supposed to start a game, I'm scared."

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 We got a lot of great stuff today, I think we have a lot of great stuff this week, actually.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,500
 A lot of cool stories, I've been spending the weekend researching,

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,000
 that's normally what I do, is I'm popping around on the internet,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,600
 following up leads and things like that,

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
 I found a couple stories that I've been looking for for a while,

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
 so I think we got some good stuff this week.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,000
 So, first off I wanted to start with a bit of an audio clip,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
 it was a video clip that I converted to an audio clip.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,800
 My brother and my nephew, Jace, were out the other night,

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,600
 I think doing soccer practice or something like that, it was dark.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
 And a bright light basically appears in the sky.

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 Now my brother, he thinks, first he thought it was some sort of like meteor,

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,400
 but then, since it was up for so long, the way it was moving, he said it must have been a rocket.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,200
 And here he is trying to videotape it and understand and try to figure out

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
 if it was a rocket and if everything is okay.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,400
 And then my nephew, Jace, throwing in his own hypotheses,

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,000
 his own explanations for this mysterious light in the sky.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,700
 You got the soccer ball?

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,500
 I think we're okay, it was just like it was heading straight this way.

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,200
 And there was three of them.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
 Ah, it's calling, look see?

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 Dad, aliens are real!

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
 No, no, no.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
 Dad, you're the one who's gonna kill me.

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
 So many public surprises started.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,300
 Alright, well let's just walk, start heading back to the truck.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,900
 But remember...

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,400
 Well hold on, let's see what it does.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,600
 That was the weirdest thing I ever saw.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,300
 I'm really freaked out.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,800
 Because this is a puff of light of smoke.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,500
 I know.

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
 Oh, is that God?

44
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
 No.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,000
 That could be God.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
 I don't know what it, I think it's a rocket.

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,200
 I think it's God.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 We don't get rockets.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
 Why is it so bright?

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,900
 Yeah, we don't get rockets around here.

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,800
 Yeah, but we saw that one.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,600
 How come everything, when we come here at night something strange happens?

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,100
 Um...

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,400
 I'm a little freaked out.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,500
 Actually, I'm a lot freaked out.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,700
 I know, just hold on.

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,500
 I only have a few minutes left.

58
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,300
 What makes it so bright?

59
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,500
 I guess the rocket engine.

60
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,600
 I don't even know if it's a rocket.

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,900
 It's gotta be, and the things that we saw behind it had to been like...

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,400
 the other parts that were like...

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,500
 But that would be all the news and everything.

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,600
 Well, I'm sure it will be.

65
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,000
 Whoa.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,800
 Oh, the straight light, I was like...

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,700
 I just saw a pup, like you saw a pup a smoke and then I looked, you said, "Whoa."

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,400
 And I looked over and I saw, I was like...

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,100
 It was like billowing.

70
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,900
 That's, that was what the weird thing was.

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
 That looks like Jesus, though.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
 Jace, sell down.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,900
 Jesus.

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,100
 But then, looks, now looks like the spaceship is coming right towards us.

75
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,700
 It does.

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,600
 I'm a little freaked out now.

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,000
 I don't want to stop filming though.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,900
 I'm gonna stop, okay?

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
 Okay, I'm scared.

80
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,900
 So, other than getting some awesome sound clips out of that, like, I'm so scared.

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,100
 And it's a zombie apocalypse, which I'm sure will show up on future episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio.

82
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
 I think that's an interesting one.

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
 First off, it's just kind of cute, but...

84
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,700
 Secondly, I think it's interesting because...

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,900
 I think it's interesting because basically he's going through all of the mysterious things he knows.

86
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,800
 We have, within a span of two minutes, claims of aliens.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,300
 Zombie apocalypse.

88
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,200
 God.

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,300
 Jesus.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,900
 And then right after claiming that it looks like Jesus, he once again refers to it as a spaceship.

91
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,700
 And I just think that's adorable.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,300
 I just think it, and just to let you know, I know you guys can't see the video.

93
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,800
 It looks nothing like Jesus.

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,900
 It's a big floating ball in the sky.

95
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,000
 But yeah, it was adorable.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,900
 And you know, I think that's one of the cool things about mysterious events and paranormal stuff.

97
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,200
 Most of us really got into it when we were kids.

98
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,400
 And I think that's one reason why it's really fun.

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,500
 Even though I'll debunk a lot of stuff.

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 This week, and I was thinking, "Man, I debunk a lot of stuff on the show. Is that cool?"

101
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,900
 And I was like, "Yeah, I think because I walk a fine line, I debunk stuff."

102
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,500
 And then the next story segment, I'll talk about the Conjuring 2 and ghosts and stuff like that.

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
 Because I still believe in a lot of this stuff.

104
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,700
 I still believe in a lot of this stuff.

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,200
 There's just other stuff that I'm just like, "I want more proof."

106
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,200
 I don't necessarily want to seek out to destroy people's fun.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,700
 My goal is, "Let's push harder. Let's get some better stuff."

108
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
 Let's get some better stories.

109
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,700
 Let's get some better proof.

110
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,000
 So yeah, we all get into this when we're kids.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
 I just think that's adorable.

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,100
 Conspiracies are interesting because we tend to get into those as we're older.

113
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,300
 And I think that's why they tend to be a little darker.

114
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
 You know, you very rarely use something.

115
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,200
 You'll hear about good ghosts and evil ghosts and angels and demons.

116
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,100
 Very rarely do you hear about good conspiracies.

117
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,900
 There's not like an Illuminati out there doing good deeds.

118
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
 That we know of.

119
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,300
 There are always these mean conspiracies.

120
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,200
 So that's interesting.

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
 And you know, actually I think I might do a future topic on that.

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,100
 I'm going to look for some good conspiracy theories.

123
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,500
 Conspiracy theories that supposedly help people.

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,400
 So we're going to go ahead and move on to our next story.

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,300
 And for our next story, we're going to have to take a little trip to the Paranormal Board on 4chan.

126
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
 Dave on YouTube.

127
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,500
 I was, you know, post up my episodes on YouTube, cut them up and put them on YouTube.

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,700
 And Dave said, "Hey, you should check out the red light incidents."

129
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,400
 And so I said, "Oh, thanks Dave.

130
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,900
 I appreciate all the feedback I've gotten.

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,500
 You guys have put me on some really good stories.

132
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 You guys have given me a lot of good information.

133
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
 So I keep that coming.

134
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
 Red light incidents.

135
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,000
 So this could be one of two things.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,900
 But let me go ahead and tell you what's going on first and then we'll kind of analyze it.

137
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,400
 In March of this year.

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,800
 A guy wakes up in his house and there is a red light coming from his bathroom.

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,500
 And he took several photos, which is good, which is what we want.

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,800
 We want photos and we want video recording, not of orbs, but we want something more to latch on.

141
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,100
 So he wakes up and there's a red light emanating from his bathroom, like the doors cracked a bit.

142
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,700
 And he has these photos of this red light coming in.

143
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,400
 So when we look at the first post he made, it was at 411.

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,800
 And whether or not it was 411 where he was at, we don't know, but that's just the way that the timing system works on 4chan.

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,600
 So at 411, he posts on 4chan saying, "Hey, I woke up.

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,400
 There's this creepy red light coming from my bathroom.

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
 I don't know what to do."

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,700
 And he takes several photos and people on the forum are interacting with him saying,

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
 "Oh, go check on it."

150
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,800
 And other people are like, "No, no, don't check on it."

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,500
 A poster named Simon.

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,800
 And most, I'd say 99% of people on 4chan go anonymous, but every show often you have what is called

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
 using a trip to be polite.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
 That is the term I will use.

155
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,400
 This guy was using a trip, which means he entered in a name and Simon pops up and says,

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,100
 "Your house is about to be shifted to another dimension.

157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,400
 You need to get outside.

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,500
 Doesn't matter if it's daytime or nighttime, preferably daytime, but you just need to leave your house.

159
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,800
 Otherwise, you're going to get trapped in your house and when you, you're not going to be able to leave it.

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,900
 And it's possible that it's already too late, but you should get out of your house."

161
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,300
 And that comment was shifted and moved among, you know, tons of other comments for people

162
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,600
 who are like, "Go investigate it.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,200
 Get safe.

164
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
 Go investigate it.

165
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,400
 Call the cops.

166
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,100
 Go investigate it."

167
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
 Da-da-da-da-da-da.

168
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,700
 At 5/11, he stops posting.

169
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,200
 He's gone.

170
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,300
 Now, again, because everything's anonymous, we don't know if he ever posted again or anything like that.

171
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,400
 And that was the end of that.

172
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,900
 And after 5/11, after his last post at 5/11, people are like, "He's dead.

173
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,300
 He got warped to another dimension."

174
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,600
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

175
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,900
 In April of 2018, we have another new post to 4chan.

176
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,800
 So this guy is walking down the street and this, this time we're clocking in and then at 23/10.

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,700
 So that would be 11 o'clock, 10 after 11.

178
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,100
 He's walking down the street and he sees a UFO shaped as a cloud, which generally we just call clouds.

179
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,900
 But anyways, it's a UFO shaped as a cloud.

180
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,600
 And he takes a picture and it's, it's clearly just a long tubular cloud.

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,300
 Doesn't look like a UFO at all.

182
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,100
 But as I'm told in this thread, sometimes UFOs disguise themselves as clouds.

183
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
 These are called cloud ships.

184
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,100
 I've never, I mean, I might have come across that before, but again, that's just ridiculous.

185
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,300
 So otherwise, they'd all be clouds and we would never see one if they have the ability to do that.

186
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,900
 But, and so then he's walking home.

187
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,200
 And at this point, he's saying, you know, I feel like someone's walking behind me.

188
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,100
 I feel lightheaded in my eyes.

189
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,600
 I'm starting to see trails in front of my eyes and they ask him, you know,

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 you should go home and arm yourself.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,500
 Can you get a gun again?

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,300
 Because it's an international website.

193
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,100
 You don't really know who you're talking to at that point.

194
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,200
 He says, I'm from Corona, California, and I do have a gun because obviously if he was in Britain,

195
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
 he would just have like a billy club or something.

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,400
 So he finally gets home.

197
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,100
 He's like, oh man, I finally feel relieved.

198
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,000
 Like whatever was happening outside, I finally feel like I'm home.

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,300
 And then he begins taking photos of red lights coming from a room in his house and it looks the same.

200
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,900
 It's the same type of dark red light that's just kind of emanating from the room.

201
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,100
 And you see the doors partially opened and you see it coming from the room and coming, you know,

202
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,300
 all it looks eerie and he's like, I have my gun.

203
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,400
 If I see something moves, I'm going to come after it.

204
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,900
 Now, Simon is back in this thread as well.

205
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,300
 And he again, using the name Simon, and he's like, this house is about to be shifted into another dimension.

206
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,800
 You need to leave the house and get out of the house.

207
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,200
 And he's like, oh, and I should say too, this poster, the guy who started this thread actually did take a photo of himself

208
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,800
 with a bloody nose saying, I got a bloody nose from whatever was happening outside.

209
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,000
 And there's a picture of him with blood on his face.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
 People are saying, stay, people are saying, go in the room and see what's in there.

211
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 Simon's saying to leave the house as soon as possible.

212
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,800
 And the anonymous guy, the guy who is telling the story says that he starts to see a shadow moving in the room.

213
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,700
 At 2.07 in the morning is the last time he posted.

214
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,000
 And then they wait basically an hour to call it.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,500
 The people on 4chan are still commenting on it.

216
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,400
 And after about an hour, they're like, okay, he's been gone for an hour.

217
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,000
 He's something happened to this guy.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,100
 And as far as we know, this poster has never been back to 4chan.

219
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,600
 Again, it's anonymous. We wouldn't know.

220
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,000
 But this person, no one's ever come back to say, hey, I was the guy who started that thread.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,800
 The fact that Simon popped up in both threads and said the same thing both times, this is what's going on.

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 I think that is an interesting thing too.

223
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 Now, again, there's a thing and I've used the term before to LARP.

224
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 It means live action role play.

225
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,000
 It basically means that people pre-oh, like I've just been possessed by a succubus.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,200
 Ask me seven questions before I disappear or whatever and people pretend to do this stuff.

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
 It's real popular in the paranormal community.

228
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,900
 Unfortunately, I see a lot of stuff like I am one of the nine angels of hell.

229
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
 I'm about to destroy humanity.

230
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,800
 Ask me questions.

231
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,900
 It's so bizarre.

232
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:56,700
 It's very, very likely that Simon is a LARP that he popped into both of these threads and was saying this stuff.

233
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
 And again, because people are saying, well, how do you know this?

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 How do you know this?

235
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,200
 And he's very vague on how he knows this stuff.

236
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,500
 And he seems to be very, very informed on the red light incidents, even though no one has encountered them before.

237
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,300
 We had two within two months and he's on both boards.

238
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,900
 That actually makes me think that the stories are made up very easy to stage.

239
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:26,200
 Basically, you could put any red light emitting object in these rooms, a red light bulb or anything really,

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,900
 that emits enough red light and then you could set it up and then you would have a character named Simon pop in and be like,

241
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,300
 get out of the house, get out of the house.

242
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
 And then the story just ends and then they could repeat that again next month.

243
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,000
 They could repeat that ad nauseam.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,300
 The other theory is that the red light incident itself is real.

245
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
 Simon is a LARP.

246
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,000
 So Simon's just jumping on the bandwagon and these people just stopped posting for whatever reason.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,200
 The second part of that, the people stopped posting seems weird because if it was,

248
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,400
 the red light incident was real but everything ended up being okay.

249
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
 You think they'd come back.

250
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,900
 I mean, enough time has passed.

251
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,100
 We're talking about posting April and March of this year.

252
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
 We haven't had any callbacks to the red light incidents that I've seen at least.

253
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,200
 So let's look at the third paranormal option.

254
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,800
 That somehow, and again, I'm going to, Simon may be a legit figure in this,

255
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,900
 but I'm, I'm wary to say that because Simon started saying that the aliens

256
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,500
 or the interdimensional entity was watching the people in the thread

257
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,700
 who were reading the 4chan post themselves and was going to come after them next,

258
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,900
 which hasn't happened as far as we know.

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
 We haven't had any other posts like this.

260
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,100
 And again, that's just, again, a kind of way to make the story creepier.

261
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,800
 Let's assume just for the sake of a fun story that the red light incidents themselves are true

262
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
 and remove Simon from it.

263
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,200
 I think there is something scary about a supernatural force invading your own home.

264
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 I think that's why we find ghosts in your house far scarier than a ghost in an abandoned asylum.

265
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,300
 Generally, ghosts, when you have the two types of stories,

266
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,100
 especially like when we look at fiction, you have a group of people go into an asylum

267
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,000
 and the asylum like has to lock them in.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,200
 They're like, Hey, let's go here for the night and drink and have sex and do drugs.

269
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
 And a ghost is taking them out one by one.

270
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,200
 And when we watch shows like Ghost Hunters and stuff like that,

271
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,800
 where they go into the asylum, they're like, we're here and, you know, Westmore Prison

272
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,100
 and we're going to be here all night and we're going to investigate all these ghosts.

273
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,600
 It's not as scary as you are a family living in a house that is haunted.

274
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 The same way if you are in a business and someone breaks into that business,

275
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,100
 especially if you're not there, if you go to a business every day,

276
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,500
 someone breaks into it one day and robs it and you come back the next day.

277
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,700
 You're like, what happened to your window?

278
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
 And they're like, Oh, someone broke in last night.

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,700
 You'll be like, Oh, that sucks.

280
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,900
 If you go home and your house has been broken into it's it is chilling.

281
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,500
 It is a true.

282
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
 It feels like a true violation.

283
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,500
 It's very, very unnerving when you when someone has broken into your house.

284
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,400
 It's it's bizarre.

285
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,300
 It's you have this really weird sense of you're not safe anymore.

286
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,800
 Someone broke into your house.

287
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
 So if these events were happening in the woods, they're like, Hey, I was walking

288
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,200
 through the woods and I saw a creepy cabin and there was like a red light flashing

289
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
 and the guy disappeared.

290
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,000
 It would be less scary than I woke up in the middle of the night and there was

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 a red light coming from a room in my house and then the person disappearing.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
 And again, it's just a total violation.

293
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,800
 So it works on that level.

294
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,900
 If these things are happening, if these red lights are somehow appearing,

295
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,100
 the question would be is what are they and what are they doing?

296
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,900
 Nobody wants to wake up to that and nobody wants to disappear to that too.

297
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,800
 And you look at all the times people have gone missing and there's always that thing

298
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,200
 in the back of your head like you're like, it could have been a serial killer.

299
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
 They could have fallen off a cliff.

300
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,700
 Could have just they had a heart attack in the middle of the woods.

301
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,700
 There's always that thing in your back, your head and where you're like, but what

302
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,200
 if you know, what about those stories where people are like, yeah, they left to go

303
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
 to work and then we never saw them again.

304
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,200
 Like we saw their car on the side of the road and there was no sign of foul play

305
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,600
 and their purse was there and their keys are in the car and they're just gone.

306
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,100
 Getting erased is scarier than getting kidnapped.

307
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,500
 It's, you know, infinitesimally less likely.

308
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 That's scary nonetheless.

309
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,600
 But so those are the red light incidents.

310
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,900
 Are they real phenomenon that's happening?

311
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,800
 Are people really disappearing?

312
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,200
 And is it related to these red lights that are popping up in people's rooms?

313
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,400
 Or is it just fake?

314
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:56,200
 Is it some people having a joke is Simon the same person posting the red light stories?

315
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,700
 Or is it just a group of people saying, hey, let's have a laugh.

316
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,200
 Let's make this up.

317
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,700
 I think if it was totally fake, I think we would have seen more by now because again,

318
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,600
 this took place months ago.

319
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,100
 It's a spooky story nonetheless.

320
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,400
 So I wanted to share that with you and thanks Dave for bringing my attention to that.

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
 And if anything else pops up with these stories, we'll let you guys know.

322
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,900
 So here we go.

323
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,300
 Conspiracy time.

324
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,700
 Do nuclear bombs exist?

325
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
 Let's go ahead and jump into this guy.

326
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,000
 Not literally into a mushroom cloud, but let's go ahead and jump into this thing.

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,300
 So, you know, there's a lot of mysteries that we have about nukes and nuclear power in general.

328
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,300
 So I, in a way, I sympathize with this conspiracy theory.

329
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,600
 I get where they're coming from.

330
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,100
 These are the main components.

331
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,800
 These are real because I had to do a ton of reading on this stuff.

332
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
 These are pretty much the main arguments.

333
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,600
 I'm just going to bullet point them for you right now.

334
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,300
 One, nuclear bombs don't exist.

335
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,600
 Two, nuclear bombs can't exist.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,200
 The level of power they put out is not possible.

337
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,700
 It's kind of the argument.

338
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,400
 You just can't have these type of bombs.

339
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,900
 So basically their argument is that yes, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were attacked.

340
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,800
 But it wasn't one plane dropping one bomb on Hiroshima and then a plane dropping a bomb on Nagasaki.

341
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
 It was firebombing.

342
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,700
 The whole city was firebombed.

343
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,800
 Now, despite the fact that that would require an entire fleet of planes flying over Japan and dropping firebombs,

344
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,300
 that's what they think happened twice and Japan never shot them down.

345
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,900
 They're saying that the people who survived this, people who survived Hiroshima and Nagasaki are like,

346
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,000
 "Yeah, I was just sitting there and I was just like eating tofu or whatever."

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,100
 And all of a sudden I felt an intense wave of heat hit my back and I got all these horrible burns.

348
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 And they go, "Pfft, that happens during a firebombing."

349
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,800
 So it was a firebombing.

350
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
 They didn't suffer.

351
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 They don't know when it's reporting that they suffered the effects of a nuclear blast.

352
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
 They're reporting they suffered the effects of heat.

353
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,000
 But that's their argument that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were firebombed.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,700
 There is a claim, one of the claims they used to show that nukes don't exist is that ICBMs don't exist.

355
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:14,400
 There's the claim that there's no unedited footage that exists of an ICBM leaving one continent and hitting another.

356
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,500
 I don't even know of any edited footage of an ICBM leaving one continent and hitting another.

357
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,100
 I'm sure they've tested them in some way.

358
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,600
 I always thought they landed in the ocean.

359
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,400
 I don't think even an ally would want America going, "Hey, we're going to test this ICBM.

360
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,700
 We're going to shoot it at you and let us know where it lands."

361
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,500
 They don't have a warhead on it, we promised Britain.

362
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,900
 They're saying that all of the footage you've seen of nukes, of explosions,

363
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,100
 are either edited with Hollywood special effects.

364
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,500
 And of course, you can go on YouTube and watch video after video of their, like, "Look at the clouds don't move and here."

365
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,400
 And then look at how this shock wave and they'll say, "Look at we have a...

366
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,400
 We're showing the footage of the explosion and then we're showing the people just standing here looking at it.

367
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
 And then we cut back to the explosion.

368
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,500
 And that cut there is so they could edit the footage."

369
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,900
 One thing to remember is that the footage that we see as civilians is not the footage that the military sees.

370
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,700
 They don't watch the edited version of them cutting back to themselves.

371
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,800
 They have two views.

372
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,100
 They have a camera of just them and then they have footage of just the nuclear bomb.

373
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,000
 So that's not really, I mean, we may be getting the edited footage,

374
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
 but the unedited footage of the clear blast exists.

375
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,400
 Other people say, "Oh no, no, the blasts were real. It wasn't edited. It was just big explosions."

376
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,800
 One of the points of proof that nuclear bombs don't exist is they've never been used.

377
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
 Against the United States.

378
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,500
 Therefore, they don't exist.

379
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,300
 That was a weird argument.

380
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,900
 I mean, yeah, because then that would lead to a nuclear war.

381
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,800
 You know, we used them first and then basically that was it as of now.

382
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,500
 So if they were used against us, then we, you know, most likely wouldn't be here.

383
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,700
 There would just be possibly a short exchange of nuclear bombs,

384
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,600
 but it would probably get out of hand pretty quickly.

385
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,900
 This one I loved.

386
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,600
 This is this, this, I'm going to quote this verbatim.

387
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,900
 "The idea that mushroom clouds are unique to nuclear blasts is also a complete myth."

388
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,800
 And that is true, that any big explosion can cause a mushroom cloud.

389
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,400
 But let me go back to this.

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,800
 In fact, you can create a mushroom cloud explosion in your backyard with common materials.

391
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
 Don't do that.

392
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,900
 Please don't do that.

393
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,500
 Please don't try to prove that nuclear bombs don't exist

394
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,400
 by creating an explosion large enough to create a mushroom cloud in your backyard.

395
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,100
 That might be one of the most irresponsible things.

396
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,900
 I've seen just as an aside on a conspiracy theory in a long time.

397
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,100
 That would be the equivalent of you don't believe in quantum suicide,

398
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,700
 put a gun in your head, pull the trigger, watch, you'll live.

399
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,500
 Do not build a bomb in your backyard.

400
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,900
 That's really bad.

401
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,400
 So the question obviously is this.

402
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
 They're saying the nuclear bombs don't exist

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,400
 and that all the footage is either faked or it's just conventional explosions

404
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
 and Nagasaki and Hiroshima were firebombed.

405
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,000
 At least they admit Hiroshima and Nagasaki happened,

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
 but then the question comes to just like with Flat Earth or any of these conspiracies,

407
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,100
 why?

408
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,600
 Why have they been faking this?

409
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,100
 The conspiracy theory behind why they're faking this

410
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,600
 was that they wanted people to live in fear

411
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,300
 and they wanted to divert billions and trillions of dollars into these government projects

412
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,700
 and just like, I don't know, take it home with them.

413
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,000
 So, and you know, I get the whole thing about the government just wanting to create an era of fear.

414
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,600
 But you know, the thing with this conspiracy theory is that

415
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,100
 the thing is, is that conspiracy theories work best when they're very, very contained

416
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,200
 to a certain group of people or a certain geographical area.

417
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,300
 So you can say that the Bilderberg is this group that we're not allowed access into

418
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
 and they make all the decisions for the world.

419
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,500
 They make all the like, what's going to happen politically and socially in the world for the next year?

420
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,300
 What are their aims and goals?

421
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,900
 That is centered on a group of people that meet in a area at any given time

422
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,400
 and they're all basically very secret and that is a real group.

423
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,500
 That's not a conspiracy theory, isn't that?

424
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,900
 They exist. The conspiracy theory is how much control they have over the general population.

425
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,500
 So, I mean, like the amount of people that it would take to cover this conspiracy theory up is mind-boggling.

426
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,600
 At least the fake moon landing, they can say, you could have really just had a core group of people

427
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,700
 know that it was fake and all the telemetry that was coming in on the computers in the NASA offices were, were faked.

428
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,100
 You had a core group that said, we know you're not really going to the moon, the three astronauts,

429
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,600
 a couple other people who are in on it.

430
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,500
 Everyone else working at NASA was getting fake data and they thought it was real.

431
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,700
 That's a limited conspiracy theory.

432
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:55,300
 The amount of people you would need to pull off the fact that the Earth was actually flat is phenomenally large.

433
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,800
 Moon landing, you can do it small.

434
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
 You can have that be a small conspiracy.

435
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,200
 This thing, again, it's just too big.

436
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
 There's hundreds of countries.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 American Russia aren't the only countries with nukes.

438
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
 You know, why wouldn't?

439
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,700
 Why wouldn't Iran just say nukes don't exist?

440
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,700
 We don't need them because they don't exist and we're not going to tank our economy trying to get them

441
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,200
 because they don't exist and people would be like, well, of course they exist.

442
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,700
 Look at this footage and then they're like, no, these footage is fake.

443
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,200
 I just, you know, the amount of coverup that would be needed for this and really again,

444
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,400
 their main evidence is it's impossible for them to exist, which is not true.

445
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
 And the footage is fake.

446
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,700
 Now, again, like at what point do you start to accept footage as being real?

447
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 I think there has to be some sort of standard that is set where we go, this is real footage and this is fake footage.

448
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 I don't know what that standard is, but I think there's probably this weird overlay where someone could look at nuclear bomb footage

449
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
 and go, no, that's fake.

450
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,500
 Look at the edits and then see footage of Bigfoot walking through the force and go, that's real.

451
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,400
 That's proof of Bigfoot.

452
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,900
 It's mind boggling.

453
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:12,600
 But again, I do get the idea that I think if I agree more with the argument, I don't, I believe nukes exist,

454
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,700
 but I believe more with the argument that the technology to make nuclear bomb doesn't actually exist

455
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:24,800
 and all of the footage we've seen of nuclear blasts are simply conventional explosions to a huge degree.

456
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,100
 It's a ton of dynamite versus, nah, the footage is fake.

457
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,800
 You can't believe it.

458
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 Fake news, fake news.

459
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,400
 Like, one of them is a very lazy excuse just being like that footage is fake and the other one is them saying,

460
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,600
 no, that's an actual real explosion.

461
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,000
 I just don't know what caused that explosion.

462
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,300
 That's a more viable path for nukes are fake.

463
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,600
 There's tons of resources on this, by the way.

464
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,700
 Like, I had a hard time parsing down the information that I was going to talk about.

465
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,000
 This is a, again, another growing conspiracy theory.

466
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,300
 Nuclear bombs don't exist and on the face of it, it sounds completely foolish, but people really believe it.

467
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:09,200
 I would love to make a massive diagram to see people who believe in certain conspiracy theories

468
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,800
 and then also believe in adjoining conspiracy theories.

469
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:19,100
 Like, does this have a lot of crossover with the Moon landing was fake or does it have more crossover with Flat Earth?

470
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,400
 Because I'm sure there's those loops.

471
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,700
 I think people who believe in ghosts and the supernatural, the weirdo stuff, they're farther away from this.

472
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,400
 They'll be like, oh, I mean, I believe in ghosts and I believe in demons and I believe all sorts of crazy stuff.

473
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,100
 Red lights moving through the darkness and stuff like that.

474
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,500
 That, to me, is far more plausible than someone telling me nuclear bombs don't exist.

475
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:47,000
 I think it is much easier and actually much less mentally stressful for me and I think for a lot of people

476
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,600
 to someone says ghosts don't exist and I go, well, I think that they do.

477
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,000
 So you're saying something doesn't exist and I think that it does exist

478
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,800
 versus something existing and me saying that doesn't exist.

479
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,300
 That's a totally different mind trick.

480
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,100
 One of them is saying I have a bicycle at home and they're like, no, Jason, you don't have a bicycle at home.

481
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:14,700
 And I'm like, I'm pretty sure I have a bicycle at home versus I'm looking at my bike and I go, I don't have a bicycle.

482
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,300
 I think that's the difference between the two.

483
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,200
 And it's really, really odd that looking at a bicycle and saying I don't have a bike

484
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,600
 is becoming more and more common with conspiracy theories.

485
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,900
 Stuff like the Illuminati is, I don't, I've never seen proof of it, but I'm pretty sure it exists.

486
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,700
 Or I've seen limited proof of it and I'm pretty sure that exists.

487
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,900
 You know, so we have stuff like the Illuminati and MK Ultra and Bohemian Grove and things like that where we go.

488
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,100
 I see enough evidence to make me think this is real.

489
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,900
 And then we have the conspiracy theories that there is evidence it is real and people going, I don't believe in that.

490
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,600
 I flat out don't believe that.

491
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,900
 And it's weird.

492
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,300
 And I wonder if we're going to see a rift in the conspiracy theory community over this.

493
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,400
 I don't think, I don't think people who are researching like these more grounded conspiracy theories,

494
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,800
 like is MK Ultra still operating?

495
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,600
 Want to associate with people who are flat earthers.

496
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,200
 I think even people who are 9/11 truthers don't want to associate with people who say nuclear bombs never existed.

497
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,000
 Because they completely just, people can sit down and listen to you and be like, oh yeah, you know molten steel at the bottom.

498
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 You know, jet fuel can't melt steel beams and you know, there was hidden explosives and stuff like that.

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,800
 And then someone walk and sit next to that guy and say, yeah, did you also know nuclear bombs don't exist?

500
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,400
 All the footage you've seen is fake.

501
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
 You'd be like, what?

502
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,700
 I'm trying to convince this guy about physics, how buildings fall.

503
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,400
 And you're talking, saying that nuclear bombs don't exist.

504
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,400
 So I think we are going to see a rift in the conspiracy theory community.

505
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,200
 And honestly, if the more grounded can, and I'm using that term very, very lightly, very lightly.

506
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,900
 I think 9/11 truth or movement is, like I've said before, I researched that for a near decade.

507
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,500
 And I came around, I used to be a truth there and then I realized that it was just nonsense.

508
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 But if I was still a 9/11 truth or I wouldn't want nothing to do with the flat earthers and nothing to do with the no nuke people and all of this stuff.

509
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 World War II didn't happen.

510
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,600
 I don't want anything to do with them.

511
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,200
 I want to talk about physics and I want to talk about geopolitical realities.

512
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,000
 I don't want to talk about the idea that you're looking at something that clearly, clearly happened and saying that it's totally false.

513
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So I think we're going to see that rift there.

514
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
 Well, that was our Monday episode.

515
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,500

 We got some good stuff this week.

518
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,600
