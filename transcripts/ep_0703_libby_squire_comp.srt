1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Just when you thought eggs couldn't get any more disgusting

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,880
 They did like Jason. I love eggs. I don't know why you ate eggs so much. Anyways, they're disgusting

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,600
 And that's not the whole story. I'm gonna talk about other stuff and then a man has a close encounter of the tea time

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,500
 You know Jason these are making less and less sense. Hold on and

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,560
 then and

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,960
 Then we cover a true crime story

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,920
 That should strike fear into the heart of any

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,240
 Well-meaning citizen when a young woman is stumbling home from a bar many good Samaritans reach out to help her home

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,520
 But she ends up falling into the arms of a killer today on Dead Rabbit Radio

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:53,760
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garvin

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,200
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having a lot of fun

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,780
 I'm still doing my breakneck recording to try to get as many episodes out before this heatwave hits

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,580
 But let's go ahead and introduce one of our legacy patreon's coming into that

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,740
 I'm hurry up hurry up coming to Dead Rabbit Command, bro

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:15,440
 I gotta get this episode recorded coming into Dead Rabbit Command is user profile name everyone give a round of applause

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,240
 Give a round of applause to this Tron character who has a default name. What happened? I actually reached out to you

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,440
 I try to figure out what was going on user profile name

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,080
 I remember they set up an account the name had a profanity in it

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,960
 I saw it pop up in a notification, but by the time I went to look at it

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,960
 It came to user profile name. So you are now one of the users you are now one of the gods of the Tron world

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,120
 User you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,080
 That's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot user

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,160
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,360
 We are headed out to Dong Yang China

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,560
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is taking us high above the heat up in the stratosphere where it's super cold

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,520
 We don't have oxygen. We're slowly nine, but it's nice and cool user take us on out to China

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,400
 Specifically we're going to Dong Yang that's in the Zee's Yang province

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,520
 I was recommended the story by Mason one of my longtime patreon supporters longtime supporter of the show

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:22,540
 He sent this over to me on the patreon discord. So he sent me this over. This is a delicacy in Dong Yang

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,800
 You get an egg you get one egg fresh from the chicken has to be steaming right out of the chicken's vagina

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,240
 You look at you're holding it. You're like yes

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,840
 Perfect chicken body temperature and then you've got to soak the egg and water you cook it right?

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,040
 That's how you would normally boil an egg

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,560
 Fresh out of the chickens vagina, but are they vaginas or is that what they're called on a chicken? Jamie?

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,760
 Look that up. Look me look that up and then don't tell me because it's super disgusting

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,440
 That's how you normally boil an egg you take the chicken egg or duck egg or goose egg or whatever

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
 Put it in water and boil it but dong yang man. They're like that's lame

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,560
 We got to do stuff differently step one you want to boil an egg

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
 You want to boil an egg in dong yang dude step one?

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,040
 Go to a local elementary school and you're like is that where the chicken coops are it is like dong yang have this farm

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,160
 Built into the school. No you're driving by you see all the chicken farms you pass those you see fresh egg stores

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,320
 It's just the shape of a giant chicken vagina. That's what you walk into to get your eggs

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,560
 It's not many people shop there. No you go to the local elementary school

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,080
 And you're walking in with the dude and you're like dude. I'm so hungry all I do

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,960
 I need to cure my hunger is one hard boiled egg

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,240
 I don't know why my body's built like that, but that's what I need you're walking into this elementary school with this dude

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
 And he's like oh don't worry man

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,080
 You're gonna get your one hard boiled egg, but first we got to go to the elementary school

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,600
 Then you go into the boys restroom. You're like wait what what is there chicken in here? There's a basin

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,100
 There's a giant trough and you see the your friend from dong yang going

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,040
 And he picks the basin up and then he's like help me carry this basin of children's urine

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:11,200
 To my car and they're like what man you have this basin of boys urine has to be urine from ten-year-olds your friend tells you

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,360
 You're wondering why this guy is your friend

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,480
 He's like what we do is we get urine from boys who are under ten years old and he begins to scoop out this urine

55
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,040
 I'm sure he has some sort of funnel or something like that

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,640
 I'm sure it doesn't spin all day doing this

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,240
 But he takes the urine from the trough in the boys restroom and puts it in buckets and takes it to his car

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,440
 And you're like okay. This must just be a side quest or something like that

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,520
 Right this must be collect five barrels of boy urine and then you'll get some experience points and then we'll just cook an egg

60
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,760
 So he drives you back to his kitchen your little word because he's bringing the urine into his kitchen with you and he explains to you

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,160
 Okay, so this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take this egg this egg. You need so much. We're gonna boil it and you're like finally

62
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 Let me finish we're gonna boil it and boys urine

63
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,080
 Like what so many questions have popped up in your head none of them are answerable

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,080
 Some of the questions are is this healthy? Probably not right is this clean? Probably not

65
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,360
 So in schools in these elementary schools in dong yang, this is a this is so real

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,720
 There's like infrastructure built into this when a boy needs to go to the bathroom

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,840
 The teacher reminds them remember to use the basin. I don't know where else they're going, right?

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,920
 I don't know if they're just going on the floor and they're also told if you're sick

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,480
 Don't pee in the basin

70
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,800
 Because we want to soak our eggs in boy urine, but we don't want to soak our eggs in boy urine if they have the flu

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,200
 You know, you got to think safe. So I don't know if they just go behind a tree or something like that

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,720
 I guess there's like a normal toilet to poop in too. There's not the poop basin next to it. There's some chef there

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,920
 He's like, mm-hmm. This is all for me girls just use normal toilets. They don't want to use girl urine

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,280
 They're like that's cooties in it. We tried that everyone got cooties

75
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,920
 You bring this boy urine out of this basin

76
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,560
 Some people are lucky enough like if you have a boy if you have a son in your house, you just have them

77
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,720
 P you're like, oh, yes, my own eggs. I don't need to buy those store bought eggs anymore. Honey, we're off the grid

78
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,360
 We're gonna live in the middle of nowhere and I'm gonna eat all the virgin boy eggs myself. That's what they're called

79
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,760
 I should have I should have announced that earlier. These are called virgin boy eggs and what they do is they take a an egg

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,760
 All over the place. They take an egg. They boil it not in water. They boil it in boy urine

81
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,640
 You're like, okay, you know, that's fine

82
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,640
 You would never say that I'm totally putting words in your mouth

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,320
 But let's say for let's say for a second. You think that's fine

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,360
 You take the egg you boil it in boys urine and you pull it out

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,880
 Then you're like, I'm just gonna wash it off. Right? Like maybe the boys urine

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,320
 You can't even think of any rational reason of why you would do this

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,400
 But let's say you do let's say you do and you go maybe the boys urine whatever

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,840
 I'm gonna take it out. I'm gonna wash it off. Anyways, a boiled egg is a boiled egg

89
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,920
 It doesn't matter if I'm boiling it in water or in hydrogen peroxide

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,240
 Probably does don't try that. Don't even try boiling hydrogen peroxide that might explode or kill you

91
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,360
 But this is what they do. They boil it. They get it nice and a hard boiled egg, right? Which are disgusting

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,160
 I hate hard boiled eggs. I don't even want to look at them. I deviled eggs. They're all disgusting

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,320
 I can only eat scrambled eggs

94
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,160
 kind of but

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,040
 You you take a regular egg you turn in a hard boiled egg

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,720
 You pull it out of the urine

97
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,880
 Then you crack the shell and now you have a hard boiled egg and that would be bad enough

98
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 But then they take this

99
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,560
 Unshelled egg and you go you know what this recipe is missing?

100
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,360
 More boy urine

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,080
 So then they put the unshell the only thing that was protecting it from this disgustingness

102
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,680
 They put this unshell egg back in the urine and you boil it until it soaks up all the boy urine

103
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,840
 Which is not which is not anything you want to see in any recipe ever

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,320
 It's like you know, it's done when there's no more boy urine available

105
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,160
 It actually turns golden. You're like, oh, that's a nice color and the yolk turns green

106
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:10,440
 Like moldy green and then you eat it and then you then you do your best to try to enjoy a virgin boy egg

107
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,600
 These are very popular in dong yang

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,560
 It's a cultural dish like i'm sure you know, what's funny because when you read articles about this

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,720
 It's it goes back centuries

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,000
 People say it redo it's one of those things like it does everything which should tell you that it does nothing

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,040
 Like a like I take Tylenol and it helps pain. It also doesn't improve my eyesight and make me faster

112
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,760
 Like any food or drug that claims too many different things does none of them

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,680
 So if you eat virgin boy eggs you reduce inflammation it promotes blood circulation

114
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,400
 It gets rid of fungal infections of the mouth

115
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,520
 Which i'm sure also costs by eating boy urine. It has all these

116
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,480
 Homeopathic traits, but most likely none of them exist. The residents of dong yang are actually

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,040
 There's a 50/50 split people are really divided over this because some people say it's delicious

118
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,680
 And it's totally cured my inflammation and I can run fast mom look at how fast I can run after I ate an egg

119
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,240
 And then the other people go I think they're disgusting and that would be fine

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,840
 Not everyone in town is going to eat mcdonald's right, but the problem is

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,080
 Is that

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 Whether or not you eat a mcdonald's

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,680
 You don't smell boiling boy urine all day long the people in town who hate the eggs

124
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,400
 Hate the town because they constantly smell like at certain times of the day when everyone's making these eggs

125
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,360
 You just smell boiling boy urine

126
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,920
 Wafed through the town so the people who hate the eggs they go I don't eat them

127
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,440
 But I can't avoid them. They're everywhere and walking on the street. There's like a stink cloud following me around

128
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,640
 So that's the story of virgin boy eggs. It's bizarre. It's disgusting

129
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,360
 It's like my best combination of things that I love mason. Thanks for bringing this to my attention

130
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,760
 User i'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the jason jelapi. We're gonna leave behind dong yang china trying to

131
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,040
 Outrun this stink cloud. We are headed out to a small town in america

132
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:15,160
 Old timey jason jelapi is being driven by user. We're headed out to an unnamed city

133
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,440
 Somewhere in the heartland. There's a young man

134
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,160
 He's at his house

135
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,240
 He's sleeping. Let's call him

136
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,800
 Jeremy let's call him a name. Let's call him a name. I can pronounce. Let's call him

137
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,880
 michael

138
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,800
 michael is sleeping in his bed one night and he wakes up

139
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,960
 Can't really figure out why you know just one of those things he kind of wakes up and he's sitting there in the darkness of his room and

140
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,760
 He sees that there's a light on downstairs

141
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,160
 It's like what it's weird. I'm sure that I shut that off. So he gets up out of his bed

142
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,600
 He's still kind of unsteady, you know, right when you wake up. He walks out of his bedroom

143
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
 He walks downstairs to go shut off

144
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,520
 the light

145
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 And he sees something in his kitchen

146
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,520
 He sees what he calls a little green man

147
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:08,280
 Which is an interesting description of an alien that is an old term usually that was like almost a mocking term

148
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,880
 Nowadays they're usually classified as greys or reptilians or humanoids if you don't really know how to place it

149
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,000
 But he actually uses the words a little green man in the kitchen

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,640
 He says it was about the size of an eight-year-old

151
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,880
 just standing there

152
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,280
 And he goes he didn't get any sort of sense of terror from this thing

153
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,560
 He wasn't scared of it and it wasn't scared of him. It just turned to him and smiled

154
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,880
 He doesn't get any he doesn't give any other descriptors of how this alien being looks

155
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 Just that it has green skin

156
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 And it's quite small

157
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,680
 Andy

158
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,760
 He doesn't know what to do he this normally when you would find an intruder in your house

159
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,240
 You would have a fight or flight response will fight response. There's nowhere to go. You're in your house, but

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,880
 He looks at this bean and says

161
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
 Uh, hello, would you like a drink?

162
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,600
 And he got a telepathic message in his head. Yes

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,320
 I would like a drink

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 Michael asks

165
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,040
 What do you want? Do you want some coffee? Do you want some water and he gets another telepathic message?

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,600
 I would prefer tea, please

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,480
 So Michael Michael looks in his cupboards and finds some tea that he has

168
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,880
 Which is interesting because

169
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,560
 This alien probably knew that he did have tea if he can read his mind

170
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,040
 He may have seen that he bought tea

171
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,880
 So many months ago, but he does make this tea and the humanoid is just standing in the kitchen just observing him

172
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,600
 When he's done making the tea he puts it on the table and the alien just stands there and looks at the tea

173
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,760
 Michael goes aren't you going to drink the tea?

174
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,800
 And the alien smiles and says

175
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,360
 Oh, I don't drink tea

176
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,000
 Well, why did you want me to make it then?

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Michael asks

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 The alien goes

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,120
 I appreciate the form of the tea

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,400
 And the effort that went into making it

181
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 Michael asks why are you here? What's the cause of this visit?

182
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,400
 He doesn't get a vocal answer. He doesn't get a telepathic answer

183
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,560
 Instead

184
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,880
 He sees in an instant

185
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,840
 A million images blast through his head

186
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,400
 He sees people enjoying themselves

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,160
 At home

188
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,440
 On the beach

189
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,200
 Walking through the woods

190
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,880
 He sees world peace

191
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
 He sees a world of no pollution

192
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
 He sees a world of

193
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
 World of pure abundance

194
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
 All of these images in his head

195
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
 And he's overwhelmed

196
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,880
 By this

197
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
 He says they're coming so fast

198
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
 And they don't stop

199
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 He's seen all of this joy

200
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
 But it's too much for him to comprehend

201
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 And he passes out

202
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 He wakes up in his bed

203
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 And he thinks this must be a dream right?

204
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
 It must have been dreaming. There's such a bizarre encounter

205
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 And he's like

206
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 I'm not sure if he's gonna make it

207
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
 And there's such a bizarre encounter

208
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
 He goes downstairs and he notices

209
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
 There's no tea left out

210
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
 So was I dreaming?

211
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 Did my wife

212
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
 Who Jason didn't mention was in the story earlier

213
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
 Next to him in bed?

214
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 Did my wife wake up earlier and clean all the tea stuff that I leave?

215
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 I don't know what happened

216
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 I might have just been a dream

217
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 So he tells his wife because

218
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 I had the weirdest experience last night

219
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
 And he tells her this story

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
 And she sits there and she goes

221
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 "Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night

222
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 And there was a little man

223
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 At the foot of our bed

224
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 He was just standing there

225
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
 But I figured I was dreaming

226
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
 I figured that couldn't be

227
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
 So I just went back to sleep

228
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 Michael said shortly after this

229
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
 Event they ended up leaving the house

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
 They ended up selling the house

231
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
 And moving to the countryside shortly after

232
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
 I found the story on the X-board

233
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 Probably earlier this year

234
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 I didn't archive the link

235
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
 I feel bad about that

236
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 But lately I've been doing that more

237
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
 With Reddit and X-board posts

238
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 But I just thought it was such an interesting story

239
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
 It's very

240
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,880
 The thing that I love the most about it

241
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,880
 Let's assume that it's true

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
 It could be fake like everything we cover on the show

243
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
 It's just one person's same thing

244
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
 We don't know, but the thing I love about this

245
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 Story is the tea moment

246
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 I love that little piece of information

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
 Where you have this alien

248
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
 Who can travel the cosmos

249
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 Who has these telepathic powers

250
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
 Who did he come from a world

251
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
 Of pure abundance and joy

252
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
 Or was he showing what humanity could do

253
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
 We have all of this high level stuff

254
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
 We have a man meeting an alien

255
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 We have telepathic communication

256
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 A vision of a possible future

257
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
 A vision of an alien world we don't know

258
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 But to me the reason why I saved this story

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
 For so long was the tea part

260
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
 I just love that moment

261
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
 Because yeah, you can forget

262
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
 To take the little things into account

263
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 And you have this alien

264
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
 Who has all of these powers

265
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
 And the ability to transcend space and time

266
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 But there's just something very special

267
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 About boiling water

268
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 Boiling non-urinated water

269
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
 Boiling water and taking a little bag

270
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
 And putting it and

271
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 Steeping it and then

272
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
 Having this refreshing drink

273
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 That's made of water

274
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
 And plant

275
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 It's a very, very basic drink

276
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 It goes back thousands of years

277
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
 And there is kind of a

278
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 Calmness

279
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
 To the creation of tea

280
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 Unless you have one of those whistling teapots

281
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 And then it's not, but I just love that story

282
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 I kind of love that small moment between this alien

283
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 And this human, and I keep saying alien

284
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
 We don't know what this thing was

285
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 The term little green man could have been

286
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
 A slang term

287
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 Forgery, it could have been that this person was actually green

288
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
 You know, because it's just this

289
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 Thing on export

290
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 It's just these few words that you didn't really

291
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
 Follow anything up, but I love the story

292
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
 Whether or not you picture it as a little green human being

293
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
 Or a gray alien, I just think it's a very, very

294
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 Fascinating insight

295
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
 To that human alien relation

296
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 User, let's go ahead and talk to the keys of the

297
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
 Carbonary Cofter. We've had our fill of tea

298
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 We're waving goodbye to the alien

299
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 The families paralyze now

300
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 And more of the aliens are showing up

301
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 They're like, it's probe time. We're like, oh, they're just

302
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 Going to have so much fun making tea together

303
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 Let's leave behind this town

304
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 And we are headed out

305
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
 To whole

306
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
 England

307
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 I want to tell you guys something before we get started

308
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 On this next story. This next story is real dark

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 This next story is real dark

310
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 It's a true crime story. It's something that I've wanted

311
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 To talk about for a while

312
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
 It bugs me. This story really, really bugs me

313
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
 And I'm including at the end of the episode

314
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
 So if you want to bounce out now

315
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
 And I'll see you tomorrow, that's so

316
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
 Go enjoy your urine boy eggs

317
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
 And I'll see you tomorrow

318
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,880
 But if you want to stick around for a darker true crime

319
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
 Story, we're going to go with this one

320
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
 It's not incredibly dark. It just really bugs me

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 It really makes me mad

322
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
 It really, really makes me mad

323
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 So it's not like it doesn't involve kids or anything like that

324
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
 But it's true crime story and it...

325
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
 Okay, so, we're in whole

326
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
 H-U-L-L

327
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
 That's in East Yorkshire in England

328
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
 It's January 31st, 2019

329
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 If you live over there, I'm sure you already know

330
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 Where this is going. It's fairly big

331
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
 True crime case that just

332
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 Ended. The trial just ended

333
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
 There was a young woman named Libby

334
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 Squire. She's 21 years old

335
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
 And her and her friends are out clubbing

336
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 They're enjoying life. They're getting drunk

337
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 They're partying. You know, I used to do all that stuff

338
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
 As well. You can't judge them for that

339
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
 They're out just doing their thing

340
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 What happened though is that

341
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 They're going from club to club

342
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
 They're getting drunker and drunker

343
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 And they go to this club and Libby is

344
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 Visibly drunk

345
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
 There's a difference between being

346
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 Buzzed, being drunk and being so drunk

347
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 That you legally can't be allowed

348
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
 To buy more liquor

349
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 Which that happens

350
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 That happens with a lot of alcohol

351
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
 I'm not saying Libby Squire was an alcoholic

352
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
 But that's the point where

353
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
 Bouncers at clubs, they have to look at liability

354
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 They're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, she's too drunk

355
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
 She can't come in here. Sure

356
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 She's probably going to spend money, but

357
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
 We have an obligation. We can't do that

358
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 A lot of times it's a legal obligation

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
 In the United States, I know for sure

360
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 You cannot serve someone alcohol if they're legally drunk

361
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
 So the friends want to continue

362
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 There are poor friends

363
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
 The poor friends in this story

364
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 There's a lot of people who suffer in this story

365
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
 But can you imagine if you were one of these

366
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 Young woman's friends

367
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
 They say

368
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 "Listen, we still want to continue to party

369
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
 Like, you need to hold your liquor"

370
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
 I'm putting words in their mouth. I don't know if they said any of this stuff

371
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
 These are real people

372
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
 But they do say, "Libby, we want to continue our party

373
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 We will pay for a taxi to take you home

374
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 You're too drunk to get in, you can't wait outside

375
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,880
 So they call a taxi, they pay the taxi

376
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,880
 They put her in and they give taxi driver the address

377
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
 And they go into the club

378
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
 Taxi cab driver

379
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
 Upstanding citizen

380
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
 Drives this horribly drunk young woman home

381
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 Safe and sound

382
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 And there's a lot of people like that in this story

383
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 Libby gets out of the taxi cab

384
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
 She's right in front of her house

385
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 I think it's like a dorm type of thing

386
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 I think it was like an apartment complex

387
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
 But she's right outside of her building

388
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 And the taxi cab drives away

389
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 This is England, there's cameras everywhere

390
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 We have a lot of video footage of this woman

391
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 Apparently the taxi cab drives away

392
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
 And Libby is just kind of standing out there

393
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,880
 And she falls face first on the ground

394
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,880
 She's so drunk she just gets up

395
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,880
 Brushes herself off and walks away from her house

396
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 It's January 31st in England

397
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
 It's freezing cold

398
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 And she's dressed to go to the club

399
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
 She's dressed in club clothes

400
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,880
 Which don't include parkas, they don't include ski pants

401
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 She's walking around the town of Hull

402
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
 Some of her fellow students

403
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
 Yeah, I think they dropped her outside of a dorm

404
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 I know she was going to college

405
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 Some other students are walking down the street

406
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 And they see this young, obviously drunk woman

407
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 Walking down the street

408
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 And they come up to her and they...

409
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
 Do you need any help? What's going on?

410
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
 Do you need to find a way home?

411
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 Should we call you a taxi cab? What's going on?

412
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 And she refuses their help

413
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 And you can't force somebody to be helped

414
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 So these students go, "Well, I hope she makes it home okay"

415
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 They don't know that she's walking away from her house

416
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 Hope she makes it home okay

417
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 Upstanding citizens, these young people

418
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 See one of their fellow students in trouble

419
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,880
 They want to help her out

420
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 And we have CCTV video of Libby walking down the street

421
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 And this... I love this part of the story

422
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
 It's probably the only part of the story that I do love

423
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,880
 Stranger after stranger after stranger

424
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 Stopping and asking, "Do you need help, young lady?"

425
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 "Can I get you home?"

426
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 And she refuses

427
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 Over and over and over again

428
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 People see her stumbling on the street

429
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 They're leaning out of their car

430
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
 "Hey you! Hey you mate! What's going on lady?"

431
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 "You look like you're not feeling good"

432
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
 She walks away

433
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
 Couples are walking on the street

434
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 They see her, "Hey honey, do you need help?"

435
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,880
 She walks away

436
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
 She's refusing all this help

437
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 And we have this footage of her walking down the street

438
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
 When her friends get home, she's not there

439
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,880
 The next day, they can't find Libby

440
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 That feeling

441
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 As a kid, you know, you're babysitting

442
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 You're sibling and they go missing

443
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 That's happened to me a couple times

444
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
 You're like Jason, you're a terrible babysitter

445
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 You know what I mean?

446
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,880
 Like they go running off or do something stupid

447
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 And you're like, "Dude, where are you man?

448
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 I'm trying to find you"

449
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
 And you're mad

450
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 Because you know that they're just kind of messing around

451
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 But at the same time you get that pit in your stomach

452
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 But I've only had that happen for maybe like 20-30 minutes

453
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 You're like 20-30 minutes Jason, you are a bad babysitter

454
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
 Can you imagine that happening for 24 hours?

455
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
 48 hours

456
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 We put Libby in the cab

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 The cab took her back home

458
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 We don't know what happened

459
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 Authorities are called to police

460
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
 Start reviewing this video

461
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 And they see this young woman walking down the street

462
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
 And they see person after person

463
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
 Reaching out to her

464
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 Trying to help her

465
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 She's freezing cold and clubbing clothes

466
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
 She's horribly, horribly drunk

467
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
 One thing the police notice in these videos

468
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
 Is cars pulling up

469
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 And people leaning out or getting out of the car

470
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
 And asking if she needs help

471
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
 And her refusing to help

472
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 And then the car continue on

473
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 But a couple times

474
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 They see the same car

475
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 Following her down the street

476
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 Seems to be stalking her

477
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,880
 They start to try to identify this vehicle

478
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
 The police continue to view video

479
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
 To try to find all the different angles

480
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 Of what could have happened to Libby

481
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 And they do find that at one point

482
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 This car stops

483
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 A man gets out of the car

484
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
 Begins talking to Libby

485
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
 They'd seen this happen before

486
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,880
 But then he puts his arm around Libby

487
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 And leads her to the passenger seat

488
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 She gets in the car

489
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 And the car drives away

490
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 March 20th, 2019

491
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 Seven weeks after Libby's squire has vanished

492
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 They find her body

493
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
 Floating in the Humber Estuary

494
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 She'd been in the water for so long

495
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 They don't know how she died

496
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 But they do notice some bruises on her

497
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 That could be signs of strangulation

498
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 And there also appears to be

499
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
 It's hard to tell because

500
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 The body had been in the water for seven weeks

501
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
 They're assuming

502
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
 Signs of rape

503
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 So they think it wasn't an accident

504
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,880
 They don't think she just stumbled off into the darkness

505
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 So an estuary

506
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
 I had to look this up

507
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 An estuary is where a large river

508
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
 Meets a stream basically

509
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 So they believe at some point

510
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 She had fell into the water

511
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
 Or had been pushed into the water

512
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 Or disposed of if she was already dead

513
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 And she'd been floating around this entire time

514
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 Until her body was finally recovered

515
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 But they believe they have a murder investigation

516
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 On their hands

517
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 It does happen

518
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 We covered that a long time ago

519
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 When we talked about all those people

520
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 I think we were talking about the happy face killers

521
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 That whole theory about all the people who are found

522
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 Drowned in the rivers and the waterways in America

523
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
 I'll post links in the show notes

524
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 But we see the same thing happened in

525
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
 Holland, I believe it is

526
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 Where they have a thing where young men

527
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
 Just a weird thing that young men do

528
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 They leave bars, they have to urinate

529
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 They're super drunk

530
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 And in Holland

531
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 They do it a lot, they pee into the canals

532
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
 That's where the Holland is

533
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 One of the canals in the water, right?

534
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
 And they fall in

535
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 And in America, the happy face killer

536
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 Conspiracy theory is that there's a gang of people

537
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 Who are pushing young college aged men

538
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 Into the rivers and the streams of America

539
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
 And it's counting for all these deaths

540
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 There's two homicide detectives that have been investigating it

541
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
 For decades

542
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 I did an episode on it a long time ago

543
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
 And in Holland, they have the same thing

544
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
 They don't think it's a serial killer

545
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
 They know that this is a common occurrence

546
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
 It's tragic every single time

547
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
 It's called death by misadventure

548
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
 I believe is what it's classified as

549
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 But they think someone who's drunk

550
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
 They're walking around in the dark, it's easy to fall in a river

551
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,880
 And they're drunk, they can barely walk

552
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,880
 They're not going to be able to swim

553
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
 So they're looking at that, but they're also looking at this car

554
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 And they do identify the driver of it

555
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 His name is Paul Well-Reloids

556
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 26-year-old husband of two children

557
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 Now he denies it

558
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
 Right

559
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,880
 They're talking to him and he goes, "I don't know what you're talking about"

560
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 Like, I didn't kill anybody

561
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 Everyone knows the story of Libby Squire

562
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 It's a big missing persons case in England

563
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
 But I didn't do anything

564
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 I'm married, I have two kids

565
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 I don't need to be out on the street murdering people

566
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 And they go, "But here's the thing, Paul Well

567
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 We have you on video, we have you on video

568
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 Following her in the car

569
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
 We have you on video getting out

570
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 And leading her to the passenger seat

571
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
 And Paul Well goes, "Okay, well here's the thing

572
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 I did that

573
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 But I didn't murder her

574
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
 And I didn't murder anybody"

575
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 And they go, "Well, then what happened?"

576
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 This might be the worst alibi

577
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 Ever

578
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
 And we just recently called, covered story

579
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 But a guy says he was possessed by a ghost

580
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 He's using that as his defense

581
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
 He says, "Okay, here's the thing, you're right

582
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 You do have me on video doing this stuff"

583
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
 Let me tell you the whole story

584
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 I was at McDonald's, I was eating some McDonald's

585
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 Late at night

586
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
 And I said, "Oh, I'm done with this

587
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 Normally people don't live in McDonald's

588
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
 I'm done eating my McDonald's, it's time to leave

589
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 And he goes, "I'm driving around the city

590
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 And I'll be honest with you guys

591
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 I was looking for

592
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 Some strange

593
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 I was looking to bang a girl

594
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 Because I do like having sex with women

595
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 Even though I have a wife

596
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 I wanted a little something on the side

597
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 He's totally up front about that

598
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 And he goes, "So I'm driving on the road

599
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 And I see this fairly attractive young woman

600
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 And she's dressed like she's at the club

601
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 And she must have been so cold outside

602
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 So I actually got out

603
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
 And invited her into the car

604
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 And I'm like, "Okay"

605
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 He says, "We had come to the conclusion

606
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
 That we were gonna have sex

607
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 She wanted to have sex with me, I'm a very attractive man"

608
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 He says, "This is the two cops looking at each other

609
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 I'm a very attractive man

610
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 And we needed a place to go

611
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 Obviously we can't take her back to my place

612
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 Because of my wife and two children

613
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
 So we drove out to this field

614
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 We drove out to this field

615
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 And the police are like, "You mean the field?"

616
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
 The field by the stream

617
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 Yeah, yeah, the field that has easy access

618
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
 To the waterways, yeah, we went out to that field

619
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
 And we had sex

620
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 We had 100% consensual sex

621
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 Now you see these scratches on my face

622
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
 You see these scratches on my face here

623
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 And the police are like, "We didn't see those scratches

624
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 Until you pointed them out"

625
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 And he's like, "Oh great"

626
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
 Well these scratches on here are on my face

627
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
 Because after we had sex

628
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 I realized that I'm a married man

629
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 And I had to go home

630
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
 And she was so mad I wouldn't have more sex with her

631
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 Because I'm such a sex machine

632
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 That she scratched me

633
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 Because I said, "No more sex"

634
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 The cops are like, the cops are taking notes

635
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
 They're like, "This guy is moron"

636
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
 And he goes, "I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what

637
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
 She scratched me

638
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 And I got off of her because

639
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 I didn't want to have sex with her anymore

640
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 Because she scratched me"

641
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
 It's like this Schrodinger scratch

642
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,880
 Which happened first

643
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 And the cops go, "Why didn't you just take her home

644
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 At that point?" And he goes, "Well the problem is

645
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 Is she was so drunk"

646
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 And really at this point he's admitted to raping her

647
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 Because she's so drunk

648
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 And he said that she was so drunk

649
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 But he goes, "She was so drunk

650
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
 So I may sexually assault a drunk woman

651
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
 But there is no way I would let her

652
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 Vomit in my car

653
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 What type of monster do you think I am, officers?"

654
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 So I left her

655
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 In the park

656
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
 And she was totally alive when I left, officers

657
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
 She was totally alive when I left

658
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
 And they're like, "Well, she was freezing cold"

659
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 "Yeah, I was kind of cold down, I probably"

660
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 "You know you're right, I probably should have done something"

661
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 "She might have stumbled into the waterway"

662
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
 Apparently she did, officers

663
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
 But I don't know what happened

664
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 Or after she left, I actually

665
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
 Left her in that field, totally alive

666
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 And I went to go eat some McDonald's

667
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
 The police are like, "That's suspicious"

668
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 "No one eats McDonald's twice in one day"

669
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 And he's like, "Dang it, my alibi has been blown"

670
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
 They do have him on video at McDonald's

671
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
 Twice in one day, that actually did not

672
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
 That actually did not have anything to do

673
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
 That is true, but it is not what caused the

674
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 Break in the case

675
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 So all of this stuff comes out in trial, right?

676
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
 His alibi that he does, they're showing this

677
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 In real footage, and

678
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,880
 A bunch of other stuff came out as well

679
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 Because you could argue that

680
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 Like, that is a, you've just admitted to rape

681
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 You're gonna do some time for that

682
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 But a good defense lawyer could probably argue that

683
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
 Yes, he did all that stuff

684
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 Why a client is a total disgusting human being

685
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 But he didn't murder her

686
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 Someone else may have come along and murdered her

687
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
 After the fact

688
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
 Or, that's where the bruises came from

689
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
 That it was rough sex and she walked into the river afterwards

690
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,880
 So like, a good defense lawyer could argue that stuff

691
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
 But

692
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 Here's some other factors that happened

693
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 They go and get into his car

694
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 They find a bag of sex toys

695
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 He's like, "Eh, everyone has sex toys"

696
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
 He used underwear

697
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
 Not his

698
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 And not his wife's

699
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
 It was stolen underwear

700
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 From other women's houses

701
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
 And he says, "No, no, no, I don't know why you're getting this whole

702
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
 Stealing from women's houses thing"

703
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 "I don't know where those came from"

704
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 "When I bought the car, it had a complimentary bag of sex toys

705
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 And used women's underwear"

706
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
 They also found in the trunk of his car

707
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 A scream mask

708
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 You know, ghost face

709
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
 And a clown mask as well

710
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
 The police begin to investigate him

711
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 And they realize that Paul Well

712
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 Has been convicted several times

713
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
 Of sex crimes

714
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 Now they're really on to the sky

715
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 They're reviewing footage, they're looking at all this stuff

716
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
 It turns out that not

717
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 This information is not

718
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,880
 That not, this information did not come out during the trial

719
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
 He was found guilty

720
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
 Of the murder of Libby Squire

721
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 Because they have the video footage

722
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 He basically placed himself at the scene

723
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 His defense lawyer really had no argument

724
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
 He definitely raped the woman

725
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
 She was too drunk

726
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 Too drunk, she was so drunk she was about to throw up

727
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
 He was found guilty

728
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 So now we're in the sentencing phase

729
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,880
 And that's when even more information came out

730
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
 Because you can't always reveal this information when you're trying

731
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
 It's such a weird thing, like you're being tried for that crime

732
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
 So that you usually can't bring other crimes in

733
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 Oh, it turns out he's a sex pest

734
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 He's been committing sex crimes for years

735
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 Earlier that night

736
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 Before he killed Libby Squire

737
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
 He was masturbating outside of a woman's house

738
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
 While watching her

739
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,880
 He had done that earlier that night

740
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 And there were other instances of him

741
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
 Masturbating, breaking into women's houses

742
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
 Stealing their underwear, masturbating into the underwear

743
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 And creepy of all

744
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 I find this deep in the dark

745
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 And I find this deep in the dark

746
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,880
 And creepy of all

747
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 I mean, we're talking about a young murdered woman

748
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
 And all of the lie

749
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 I mean, can you imagine being one of her friends?

750
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
 It's hard to place ourselves in the position of the murder victim

751
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 Right?

752
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 But can you imagine being one of those friends

753
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 Like we've all been in those situations

754
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 Where we've been like, "Hey dude, you're not good to drive"

755
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 "Oh no, I can totally drive bro"

756
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 We've all been in situations like that

757
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,880
 And most of the time they work out

758
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 But it only takes one time for it not to work out

759
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
 And the friends who just go, "Well, we're gonna go club"

760
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 "And we'll send you home the cab driver"

761
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
 Every single person who stopped

762
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
 Those are us, those people are us

763
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 We can't, it's hard for us to sympathize with Libby

764
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 I mean, we can definitely

765
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
 And we don't want to empathize

766
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 Or sympathize or care anything about Paul Well

767
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
 But we can all

768
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
 We've all been that person on the road

769
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 And seen something weird

770
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
 Seen it and been like, "Hey, are you okay?"

771
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
 So yeah, I mean imagine being those people

772
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 We can imagine that

773
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
 And trying to help

774
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 I almost feel like so many guardian angels

775
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
 Were sent down that night

776
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 I know that sounds really highfalutin

777
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,880
 Maybe to, you know, New Agey

778
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
 But I think everyone had

779
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 A message in their heart that night

780
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 "Hey, try to help this woman"

781
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
 "Try to help this woman"

782
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
 It's several times they have on CCTV

783
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 But it didn't help, she was killed

784
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 And so that's all creepy in and of itself

785
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
 But after he murdered her

786
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 He went home and he watched porn

787
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,880
 He was watching porn after he had just raped

788
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
 And murdered this woman and earlier in the night

789
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
 He was masturbating, staring in women's windows

790
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 Watching them

791
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 It's still not enough

792
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 He goes home and he watches porn

793
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
 And he's masturbating again

794
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 And then

795
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
 They have video of him in the middle of the night

796
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 Walking out into the field

797
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,880
 Where he says this was the last

798
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 What they imagine is he took her out to the field

799
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 He had sex with her, she fought back

800
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 He murdered her, and that's probably

801
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
 How it was

802
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 Probably wasn't consensual at all

803
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 He murdered her, he got off on it

804
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
 But he goes back to the

805
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 And then disposed of her body in the river

806
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
 Because they didn't find her out in the field

807
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
 She was just floating in the water for so long

808
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
 He goes back to the field where he had

809
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
 Murdered her

810
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 And there's video of him

811
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
 This is so creepy because I can just imagine it

812
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 They showed this video during the sentencing

813
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
 Apparently I don't think they showed it during the trial

814
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
 Oddly enough

815
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 But I could be wrong in that detail

816
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
 Because information came out in different phases

817
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
 And different articles and stuff like that

818
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
 But this would have been the end of the trial

819
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
 It would have been a one day trial

820
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
 Had this video been released

821
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
 There's video footage of Paweł

822
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
 Walking into the field

823
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 And he's masturbating in the darkness

824
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,880
 That's terrifying

825
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
 That

826
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
 That image to me

827
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
 Is so terrifying

828
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
 That is a man whose blood lust

829
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
 Cannot be satiated

830
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
 He just raped and murdered a woman

831
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
 Went home, watched porn

832
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
 Went back to the spot where he

833
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
 Raped and murdered the woman

834
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
 After the body had been disposed of

835
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
 He didn't go back to clean up evidence

836
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
 He didn't go back to tie any loose ends

837
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
 He went back

838
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
 And just jacked off

839
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
 And he just took off his clothes

840
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 And he was like

841
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
 "What the hell is this?"

842
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
 And he was like

843
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
 "What the hell is this?"

844
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
 And he was like

845
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
 "What the hell is this?"

846
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
 And he was like

847
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
 "What the hell is this?"

848
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
 And he was like

849
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
 "What the hell is this?"

850
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
 And he was like

851
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
 "What the hell is this?"

852
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
 And he was like

853
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
 "What the hell is this?"

854
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
 And he was like

855
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
 "What the hell is this?"

856
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,880
 And he was like

857
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
 "What the hell is this?"

858
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
 And he was like

859
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
 "What the hell is this?"

860
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
 And he was like

861
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,880
 "What the hell is this?"

862
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
 And he was like

863
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
 "What the hell is this?"

864
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
 And he was like

865
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 "What the hell is this?"

866
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
 And he was like

867
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
 "What the hell is this?"

868
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 And he was like

869
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,880
 "What the hell is this?"

870
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,880
 And he was like

871
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
 "What the hell is this?"

872
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
 And he was like

873
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,880
 "What the hell is this?"

874
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
 And he was like

875
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
 "What the hell is this?"

876
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
 And he was like

877
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
 "What the hell is this?"

878
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
 And he was like

879
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 "What the hell is this?"

880
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 And he was like

881
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
 "What the hell is this?"

882
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
 And he was like

883
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
 "What the hell is this?"

884
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 And he was like

885
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,880
 "What the hell is this?"

886
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
 And he was like

887
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
 "What the hell is this?"

888
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
 And he was like

889
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
 "What the hell is this?"

890
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
 And he was like

891
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
 "What the hell is this?"

892
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
 And he was like

893
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,880
 "What the hell is this?"

894
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 And he was like

895
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
 "What I wanted to cover it was that final image

896
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,880
 that really creepy

897
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
 image of that man just masturbating in the darkness

898
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
 He's celebrating

899
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,880
 his crime

900
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
 He's celebrating and who knows if he's done this before

901
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 right?

902
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 But the other reason I wanted to cover it was because of all the people

903
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
 helping out. I think that's a

904
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
 interesting part of the story

905
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
 in an alternate universe, damn it

906
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
 in an alternate universe

907
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
 I don't mean to be make light of it

908
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
 but one of those people were able to get her home

909
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
 but she kept on walking into the darkness

910
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 until the darkness

911
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
 finally took her away
