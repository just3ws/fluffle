1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
 What happens when a religious belief inspires a wave of grisly murders?

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,580
 And then we travel to France to spend the night in a quaint little hotel.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,960
 But it turns out that this hotel may finally teach us why.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:35,720
 We would never notice a time traveler walking among us today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
 I'm your host Jason Garvinder, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
 I hope you guys have some fun plans for the weekend.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,960
 We got a lot of stuff to cover here so first off let's go ahead and give a shout out to

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,680
 one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,320
 Everyone on your feet give it up for Church Going Mule.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,400
 Wooo yeah everyone take a ride, take a ride on Church Going Mule.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,960
 Hop on his back and kick his ribs.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
 We're going for a journey.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 Church Going Mule you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
 You guys can't support the show financially, you totally understand.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,600
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,080
 Now let's go ahead, I want to start off with the time slip story.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,200
 I know I announced that as the main story and that's going to be the title of the episode

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,320
 because I want to give you guys a warning.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,400
 The story about the crime wave, the grizzly murders, it's really grizzly.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,240
 So I'm actually going to save that to the second story so if you don't want to have

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,680
 this story depress you for the weekend just listen to the time slip story.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,120
 Sailor V I'll see you guys on Monday I totally understand but for you perverts, for you totally

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,840
 disgusting people out there, the grizzly murder story I've been thinking about for weeks.

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,120
 It's so fascinating, it's so fascinating I can't wait to share it with you but I know

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
 it's not everyone's cup of tea.

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
 So we'll save that story for the second story.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,800
 So Church Going Mule let's go ahead and hop aboard the Carpenter Caboose.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,920
 Grab a shovel of coal and start scooping it in.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,000
 We're headed all the way out to France.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,080
 Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,040
 Going all the way in that underwater tunnel that apparently connects America to France.

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,880
 I want to start off by giving a shout out to a website called UFO Insight.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,960
 It's a really really good high strangeness website and this article like many articles

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,040
 written on the website is by Marcus Loth.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
 I got most of my information from that website.

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
 Check it out.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,040
 We're going back to the year 1979, specifically October 3rd, 1979.

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,000
 And there's two married couples from England.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
 They're on their way to Spain.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,760
 So as they're driving through France, they see a little hotel and they're like, "Oh,

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 that place looks like a good place to stay."

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,360
 I mean, technically it's a professional place to stay.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,760
 That's what they were built for.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,240
 So they pull up to the hotel and they walk in, ding ding, and then a bell hop walks out

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,280
 and he's like, "Madame Moselle, yes, you are here.

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,080
 Why isn't Italian, French accent, Mamma Mia?

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,520
 You are here to stay the night.

51
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
 I see ya."

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,480
 And they're like, "Yes, bell hop."

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
 And then the bell hop goes, "Sorry, we're full."

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
 He teases people all the time.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,360
 He's like super courteous and carries your bags upstairs and goes, "No, sorry, no rooms."

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,480
 And makes some carrying back downstairs.

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,240
 He goes, "We don't have a room available.

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
 There's no rooms here."

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,480
 And so they're like, "Aw, man."

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,120
 But then as they're picking their bags up and they're headed back out to their car,

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,240
 there's a gentleman in old fashioned clothes standing there and he goes, "You know what?

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,200
 If you're looking for a room, if you're looking for a hotel, go down the street.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,560
 You'll find a small hotel down the road."

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,440
 So they get back in their car and they're like, "Man, that was a weird place.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,520
 Everyone had like eight different accents at once."

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,720
 They're driving down the road and they follow its directions and they notice that the road

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,320
 starts to get really narrow.

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,920
 Another driving between these buildings and they're like, "Okay, can we do this?

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,160
 It's like a Fast and Furious movie."

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,960
 All of a sudden they're like driving on the walls.

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,960
 They're driving through this narrow road and then all of a sudden...

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 That's the sound.

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,360
 You don't understand what that sound was.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,120
 If you didn't know what that sound was.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,160
 That's a car driving over a cobblestone road.

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,120
 All of a sudden the road became those little rocks.

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,080
 Those little rocks they put in the mud.

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,040
 So they're continuing to be like, "Oh dude, we need to get new shocks for this car."

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,760
 They're driving on the cobblestone road and they see on the side of one of the buildings

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
 a poster for a circus.

81
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,560
 But they notice the poster, the circus poster looks really old.

82
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,120
 Not just like it's all wrinkly and stuff like that.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,800
 It was an old-fashioned looking poster.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,400
 They keep on driving and eventually they see a sign that says "Hotel."

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
 Perfect.

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,880
 That's exactly what we were looking for.

87
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,080
 And they all get out of the car and they go walking in and right when they walk into this

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,160
 hotel it was old-fashioned.

89
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,280
 That was the way they described it.

90
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
 They walked in and it looked like an old hotel.

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,120
 It had no amenities of the modern age.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,400
 They walked in, they didn't see any signs of modern devices.

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,120
 There are no telephones like the bell hops like "Madame Mazzal, have you seen my cousin?

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
 Have you seen my cousin?

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,320
 He works down the street."

96
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,040
 They see the bell hops standing there and there's no telephone.

97
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,640
 There's no elevators either.

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
 It's all staircases.

99
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,000
 They check in, they get up to their room and they're like, "This place is so quaint.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,520
 This is actually like an old-timey authentic hotel.

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,720
 It's actually so authentic.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,480
 There's no locks on the doors."

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,440
 They're like, "What?

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,520
 Where in the world would you possibly want to sleep next to a bunch of strangers and

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
 not be able to lock if not barricade your door?

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
 No locks on the doors."

107
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,600
 And then one of the women goes, "Oh, if you think that's insane, look."

108
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,680
 And she throws open these wooden shutters.

109
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,480
 There's no glass in this window.

110
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,960
 It's just wooden shutters.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,920
 I'm like, "This is kind of weird, but maybe it is like this new thing.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,640
 They're trying to be super rustic.

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,960
 Get away from the modern age.

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,880
 It's like super hippy and stuff like that."

115
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,080
 No locks on the doors, no telephones, no elevators, no glass.

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,640
 So they start taking pictures of this incredibly quirky hotel.

117
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,040
 The next morning they wake up, they go downstairs and they get breakfast.

118
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400
 They have this really nice dining room.

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680
 They're eating ham and eggs.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,160
 They doesn't actually say what they ate.

121
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,440
 And I'm just listening to stuff that I want to eat.

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,400
 Sausage with four pancakes covered in syrup.

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,440
 They're eating my dream meal.

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,800
 And while they're eating, they see two men walk in and they're wearing these dark blue

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,080
 uniforms with these little capes.

126
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,560
 And one of them goes, "You know what?

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,280
 They're dressed like old-fashioned French police officers.

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,880
 Gen d'Arms is what they were called.

129
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,360
 These Gen d'Arms are walking around."

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,680
 And they recognize them as old-fashioned police dudes, but they don't really think anything

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
 of it.

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,200
 Again, maybe it's part of if you're going to be a police officer in the hotel, you have

133
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,640
 to change into this old-timey outfit not to ruin the illusion.

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,400
 They just continue to go about their business.

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,720
 And at one point, they get done eating breakfast.

136
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,560
 It's time to go.

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880
 And they ask someone, "Hey, how do we get to the auto route?"

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,080
 I guess that's how they call roads over there.

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,320
 How do we get to the auto route?

140
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,880
 We're trying to head down to Spain.

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,600
 People are like, "What?

142
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 What's an auto route?"

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,040
 And they're like, "You know, it's the thing that you put your car on, you go down the

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 road."

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 And they're like, "What?

146
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
 What are you talking about?"

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,720
 At this point, you figure they're probably taking the rustic thing a little too far.

148
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
 They're like, "Okay, buddy, we get it.

149
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,920
 You're from the past, but can you just give us directions?"

150
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
 And they're like, "We don't know what you're talking about."

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
 So they're like, "Fine."

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
 They go to check out.

153
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,440
 And after having pain for two rooms and they had dinner that night plus breakfast this

154
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,640
 morning, the bill is only 19 francs.

155
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,160
 Which they're like, "What?

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,680
 That's like the best deal ever.

157
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
 Are you kidding me?

158
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
 That's no money.

159
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,200
 That's basically free."

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 And the bellhop guy's like, "Well, that's just what we charge here.

161
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,280
 There's 19 francs for all that food you ate and the rooms."

162
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,800
 So they're like, "This is dope."

163
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 So they paid them.

164
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,400
 And then they end up getting to Spain.

165
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,560
 They stay there for a couple of weeks.

166
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
 They leave the area.

167
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,640
 They find the auto route.

168
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,880
 They drive to Spain.

169
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 They're there for two weeks.

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 They have a ball.

171
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,920
 Again, it doesn't have that detail.

172
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,440
 It doesn't say how much fun they had.

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 But we'll assume it was a fun vacation.

174
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,600
 And as they're headed home, they go, "You know what?

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,120
 We should stay at that quaint little French hotel that we stayed at.

176
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,800
 First off, we don't think they know how to add money because it costs nothing.

177
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,360
 But also it was just so nice.

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
 It was so nice."

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,840
 And then one of them goes, "Yes, you mean that hotel that we took a bunch of pictures

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,760
 of while they were there?

181
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,520
 They took a ton of photos of this really quirky, cool hotel."

182
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,360
 So they actually drive back to France and they can't find it.

183
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
 They drive around the area that they were in.

184
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,440
 They can't find the hotel.

185
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,720
 They continue to drive down these roads and they see the circus poster.

186
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,200
 They're like, "Oh, so we know we're in the right direction so they kept driving on the

187
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 road."

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
 But they didn't end up back there.

189
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
 They're like, "What?"

190
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,160
 And they go, "Not only did we not end up back there.

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,440
 I remember the first time we saw the circus posters, the road was cobblestone, right?"

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
 And they're like, "Yeah, but this is a regular road.

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
 This is a well-maintained road that we're driving down."

194
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,520
 And then they find the hotel that they tried to go to first.

195
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,360
 That's where the dude said, "I know this place is full, but there's another place down the

196
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
 road."

197
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
 They find that hotel and they go, "Hey, can you direct us to the hotel down the street?"

198
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,000
 And they're like, "What are you talking about?

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,720
 I mean, sure, there's other hotels in France, but do you have one in particular?"

200
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,760
 And they're like, "Well, it was this old timey one down the Cobblestone Street road."

201
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,440
 People were like, "We don't know what you're talking about."

202
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,480
 Well, there was an old-fashioned dude.

203
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,760
 There was a guy dressed up in a nice suit who was here last time.

204
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,800
 Can he tell us where it's at?

205
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 And they're describing this guy and people are like, "We have no idea who you're talking

206
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 about."

207
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,080
 I mean, technically it's a hotel, right?

208
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,320
 They don't keep a photograph and a description of everyone who's ever been there, but they

209
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,040
 go, "It's not anyone who works here.

210
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
 We don't know who told you to go down there."

211
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
 But it wasn't us.

212
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,440
 They were never able to find the hotel again.

213
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
 They weren't even able...

214
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,680
 I think you guys can see now this is a time-slip story.

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,880
 They weren't even able to go down a road and find an old...

216
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,120
 They find a version of it.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,440
 It's all rusted and there's a big old rat laying in it with a bellhop hat.

218
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
 Nothing.

219
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
 They couldn't find like that.

220
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,000
 It was burnt down or anything like that.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,400
 They can't find the hotels or the remnants of the hotel or the fact that the hotel ever

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 existed.

223
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,680
 When they get home, they have their film developed.

224
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,920
 They're not really thinking at this point there's anything paranormal that went on.

225
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,880
 They just figured everyone in France doesn't know where other stuff is.

226
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,760
 They get their photographs developed from their entire vacation and they're going through

227
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,560
 them and they go, "Oh, look, here's the photo.

228
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,760
 Here's the photos of us getting in the car.

229
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,240
 Here's the photo of us arguing about what the easiest way to get there is."

230
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,720
 And then they got to the photographs that they took at the hotel.

231
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,760
 There was no photos.

232
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,880
 Like they get to like in the timeline of where it was in the film and there was nothing

233
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,560
 there.

234
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,240
 And at this point they go, "Okay, we know we took photos of the window shutters and

235
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,360
 of the room because it was so weird."

236
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,680
 And it was quirky.

237
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,400
 And Jason keeps using that word but it was so fun.

238
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,360
 We wanted to show people about this hotel but there's no photographs here.

239
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,680
 And then they would go from their photographs of other places and it would just jump to

240
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,360
 further in the journey and then photos of Spain and stuff like that.

241
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,920
 So they had no photos and they knew they took photos when they were at the hotel.

242
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,680
 Now they're starting to wonder what actually happened because you have four witnesses to

243
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,320
 an event where they found this hotel.

244
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 No one knows where it's at.

245
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,200
 There's no photographic evidence of the hotel.

246
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,680
 Through their research they find out that that uniform, those two police officers who

247
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,240
 walked in the uniform they wore was an old-timey French uniform, which is what they assumed

248
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
 that they thought it was a costume.

249
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,680
 That uniform hadn't been worn since the year 1905.

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,240
 And it doesn't even place the story in 1905.

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,280
 They're saying that was the last time they wore them.

252
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,120
 Remember there were no phones or elevators or anything like that so it could have been

253
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
 anytime 1905.

254
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
 I mean not caveman times right?

255
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,240
 There's a sabertooth tiger in the room.

256
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,000
 Probably within you know maybe 1800s to early 1900s.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,640
 That would be the time period this would be happening in.

258
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,120
 And this story was reported and at the time apparently it became very popular in the world

259
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
 of the paranormal.

260
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,560
 People were really really intrigued by this story.

261
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,760
 Time slip stories are really really cool.

262
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,240
 And Jeff underwent hypnosis because people were like is there anything else you can remember

263
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,320
 about the places or anything else we know.

264
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 He underwent hypnosis and when he was in his hypnotic state he did not reveal any more information.

265
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,520
 But he didn't reveal any less information.

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,760
 Like well duh his memory right?

267
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
 But no if he was faking it you figured maybe the story would change or something would

268
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 get left out.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,480
 But no it was the exact same story under hypnosis.

270
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:53,040
 And the four of them believed, fully believed that they must have gone back in time somehow.

271
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
 And this story was brought to us.

272
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,880
 Marcus Lowe wrote the article that I got most of the information from.

273
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,840
 He got it from a Jenny Randall's book.

274
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,320
 Jenny Randall's is a huge paranormal researcher.

275
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,520
 She's been in the game for a long time.

276
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,200
 She's written a ton of books on it.

277
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,760
 So that again is another authoritative source for this story.

278
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,960
 And yeah at a time this was a very popular paranormal story.

279
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,680
 What's so interesting about this story?

280
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,720
 I mean the fact that four people went back in time.

281
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
 Because time slips are great.

282
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,680
 I love covering them.

283
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,320
 The idea that at any point you could be traveling from point A to point B and end up in point

284
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
 eight nine seven four.

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
 It's fascinating to me.

286
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,920
 Time slips, portals, all that stuff.

287
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,560
 It's scary but cool at the same time.

288
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,240
 But this story really raises a lot of interesting questions about what happens during this phenomenon.

289
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,720
 The four people, the four travelers from our time, realized things were off.

290
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,280
 Realized the police officers were wearing old timey clothes.

291
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
 There were no phones.

292
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
 There were no elevators.

293
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,320
 There was no windows or locks.

294
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,840
 But nobody commented on their clothing.

295
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,240
 You have to imagine they had watches.

296
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,680
 They had sunglasses.

297
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,760
 And they had litigra shirts and slacks.

298
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,760
 And no one was like oh what is that stranger doing with those odd clothes on?

299
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,400
 That's why the police showed up to have them burned at the stake.

300
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,840
 None of the people in the past commented on their clothing or the technology they had

301
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
 on them.

302
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:33,480
 And they paid their bill, their 19 francs bill with modern money.

303
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,680
 They didn't have the Euro back then so they would have had to exchange it for francs of

304
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,840
 the 1970s.

305
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,680
 And they paid with money from the 1970s and it was accepted.

306
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,560
 Now you may say the bellhop or the intaker, whoever is in charge of taking the money,

307
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,280
 maybe they weren't that observant.

308
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,200
 You would know if money was 200 years in the future.

309
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,960
 You would know if someone went back in time from now to the 1980s and tried passing off

310
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,280
 money, you'd get arrested as a counterfeiter.

311
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,880
 It's so different.

312
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,160
 Like you would have to be blind to not realize money had changed in 20 years, let alone in

313
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
 200 years.

314
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,200
 So when they were presented with modern currency, why wasn't it rejected?

315
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,960
 Pulled out of a modern wallet by a guy wearing a modern watch.

316
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,280
 Now a skeptic could say, skeptic wouldn't believe any of this story, but a skeptic could say,

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,680
 well maybe when they exchanged their money, they just happened to get money from the 1800s

318
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,600
 and maybe they all had classic watches.

319
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 So maybe that happened.

320
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 Maybe you couldn't tell.

321
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,320
 Maybe they were wearing pantaloons and they had big hats with feathers in them.

322
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
 Yeah, possibly.

323
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,120
 Maybe they all just possibly happened to dress up as Renaissance cosplayers.

324
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,560
 But I think that aside, this show, this is fascinating to me.

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,600
 It may be, because a lot of people say, how come if time travel is real, we should see

326
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,760
 time travelers.

327
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,560
 Maybe we can't.

328
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,040
 Maybe our reality.

329
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,720
 Our reality is so hard coded into us that if someone slipped from 400 years in the future

330
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,960
 or came back with a machine, came back in a time machine, we physically couldn't tell

331
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
 the difference.

332
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
 We would see them.

333
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,480
 Like think about all those experiments they have where it's like observation, like you

334
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,440
 have people playing basketball and then there's an elephant walk spy or a bear walk spy.

335
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 I'll put it in the show notes.

336
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,080
 If you have no idea what I'm talking about.

337
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:55,720
 But our ability to see absurd things is sometimes, a lot of times, hard to really comprehend if

338
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,000
 we're doing something else.

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
 Say working.

340
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
 You're running a business.

341
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,920
 So it could be that our reality, our time period is so hard coded into the way we observe

342
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,160
 things we couldn't see someone from the future.

343
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,040
 Just like they couldn't.

344
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,360
 This is absolutely fascinating.

345
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,240
 We have so many stories of time slips where people don't really interact with each other.

346
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,000
 They just find themselves in a weird location.

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
 They start to see weird things around them.

348
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,160
 I'll try to put a couple episodes about time slips in the show notes, but this is one where

349
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,800
 not only, this is an overnight time slip they spent the night here.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
 They ate two meals.

351
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,720
 They paid their bill and a car.

352
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 They drove a car.

353
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
 Don't forget about that.

354
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,400
 They drove a car down a cobblestone street.

355
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,240
 They parked it outside a hotel in the 1800s, got a room, and no one goes, "What in the

356
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,400
 what is that outside?"

357
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,640
 It may be when they looked, when the natives to that time period looked, it was a horse

358
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
 and buggy.

359
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
 Who know?

360
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,960
 I mean, I don't even know what that sounds like when they're like, "What?"

361
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,760
 The horse is just perfectly still.

362
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,960
 And then when they get in the car and they turn it on, the horse goes, "Whaa, wha, wha,

363
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,760
 wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha,

 wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha, wha,

395
00:29:50,760 --> 00:30:16,760
 The only out she saw was murdering a child. So a ceremony began to coalesce around these executions. People started to see these executions as very somber events as opposed to, you know, just two guys getting to fight and one guy gets murdered and that guy's being taken to the gallows or killed.

396
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:40,760
 Ah, kill him! Kill him! Yeah, get rid of him! This one, when these women were killing themselves by killing babies, very somber event, people would start to have these costumes they would wear, like the family would show up and they would be wearing these costumes, and there'd be this procession, there'd be like this ceremony as this young woman is being executed.

397
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:55,760
 And the government is getting very, very upset about this. This is supposed to be a deterrent. We're supposed to show, that's why we're making it so bloody, that's why we're burning the corpse. We're not giving it a Christian burial.

398
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:05,760
 This is supposed to prevent people from wanting to do this, but now we got this whole rigmarole around it and we see these people actually venerating the women who are killing these children.

399
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 So the government started adding a little bit of torture to it. They're like, "Maybe this will prevent, maybe this will prevent desperate people from finding any way out of earth."

400
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:27,760
 They added a whipping. They're like, "Oh, you've been a naughty girl, we're gonna whip you." They'd whip her with the whip. And I keep saying her because I do think that's predominantly that, but there were men who were doing that as well.

401
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:44,760
 They'd whip them. They're trying to be sexist when it comes to murdering children. This is so horrible. So they'd whip you and you'd have to spend two days on the scaffold and when they executed you, they blindfolded you.

402
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 Now that doesn't sound like the worst deterrent in the world. Like no one wants to get whipped, right? But you're like, "Oh no, two days on the scaffold, I want to die. I'm glad that you're killing me."

403
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:04,760
 And so that was the problem. For a while, this was not a... Remember, this was the number two reason for murdering a child in Sweden.

404
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:16,760
 King Gustav III of Sweden was watching this whole thing and he goes, "We gotta do something. This is a societal ill." But people go, "What do you do?"

405
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:29,760
 Like, they're just gonna keep doing this. People are gonna keep doing this. And what King Gustav says, you know what? Let's just change the law. What if if you killed a child, you didn't get sentenced to death?

406
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,760
 What if if you killed a child, you were sentenced to life in prison instead? But they didn't do that, right? That would be...

407
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:54,760
 Because there were other reasons why people were killing kids and you didn't want to have these people walking around even if they were in prison. And they ended up just leaving it as, "If you killed a child, you got the death penalty."

408
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:11,760
 It's just an interesting story. As grisly as it is, it's so fascinating because we have that collision of a religious doctrine, which has changed now. Now, suicide is still looked down upon in the Catholic Church.

409
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 But that's not doing anyone any favors. When someone who has a mental health struggle and they kill themselves and then you tell the family members, "Oh, dude, yeah, sorry, that dude's in hell.

410
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:32,760
 Sorry." Like now they've worked through that. Now the Catholic Church has changed, I believe. But I think there still are a lot of Catholics who do believe that when you kill yourself, you go to hell.

411
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,760
 Or at least you're in purgatory for thousands, if not millions of years and things like that. So... Just fascinating story. I know it's super dark.

412
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 I know it's probably not the best way to wrap up the week, but it's been on my mind. It's just this amazing collision of true crime and religion, which we don't see that often. I mean, we see cults and things like this, but that's not what this was.

413
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:05,760
 This wasn't some death cult. This wasn't a Jim Jones/Waco situation. This was an entire society of young women killing children, sometimes not even their own children. I don't even know how many were actually their own children.

414
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 I think they were just grabbing random kids and killing them, just so they could have an escape clause off planet Earth.

415
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:25,760
 But don't worry, the babies went to heaven as well. Terrifying. Terrifying story.

416
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:35,760
 You want to injure suffering, but you do nothing but bring unending suffering to the survivors, to the mothers of those children.

417
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:50,760
 Just a dark reminder of what a depraved and depressed human can do what they're capable of. They're capable of the most atrocious crime possible, hurting a child.

418
00:34:50,760 --> 00:35:03,760
 But in Christina's mind, she didn't hurt anyone. She spared that baby. That baby went right to heaven. That baby would never fall in love and have her heart broken. No.

419
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,760
 Christina was saving that baby as well as saving herself.

420
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:26,760
 At least that's what she was hoping for when she felt that executioner's acts lop off her head.
