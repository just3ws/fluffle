1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 A cult that I accidentally discovered by doing this show, a loser/loner in Japan, gives a

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:15,600
 bad name to all nerds, and then a bride and her bridesmaids, and a conspiracy to have

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,480
 the perfect wedding ever.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you're having a great

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
 day too.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,200
 I actually got my flu shot today, and they gave me some new antibiotics for my sinus

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
 infection so I overslept.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,920
 I came home, ate some lunch, took my medicine, and slept, and recording this a little bit

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,280
 later but I think it's still gonna come out around at the same time.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,040
 So sorry about that, but I needed to get some rest.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,800
 So the first thing I want to talk about, let's talk about Forest Finn's treasure.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,840
 And more appropriately, the cult of Forest Finn.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,200
 Now when I did the episode on Forest Finn's treasure, it was a basic story that was the

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,040
 lead-in of the podcast.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,160
 I basically have it structured where I have a lead-in and then I have a main story.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,480
 I spent, it was about an 8-10 minute long segment, I believe.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,840
 This is the bulk of the story.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,800
 He's a man who was a cancer survivor, he wanted to leave his legacy, he buried a treasure,

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,720
 sorry, hid a treasure.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,160
 I got called out because he didn't actually bury it, but anyways, so he hid a treasure

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,080
 and people have been looking forward for the past 8 years now.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,960
 And I present that story and then the last minute, I'm like, I think it's a hoax, I don't

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,560
 think he really buried it.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,320
 I think he just wanted people to read his memoir and I think people's biggest fear is leaving

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,280
 the world with no legacy.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
 And that was it.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,480
 And then I was like, and the next story is, much of Shadow People showed up in Sacramento

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,640
 and they were like running around my grandma's backyard.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,080
 I don't know why people think this is a news broadcast.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:08,040
 It obviously isn't, but I got some very, very stiff resistance to the Forced Finn story.

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,280
 I got a lot of pushback on that one.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,000
 Now, I'm a big boy, I can take criticism, whatever.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,840
 But the force and the amount of feedback I got on that one in a very, very short amount

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,360
 of time was startling.

37
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,440
 How dare I insult their leader?

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,280
 How dare I question the word of such an honorable man?

39
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,720
 Do I have proof that he didn't bury the treasure?

40
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,320
 If I don't have proof, then I can't say how dare I question the word of a man who honorably

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,400
 served our country.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
 I am nothing.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
 I am a couch potato.

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 I think they called me that.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,800
 Is that even still a word?

46
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
 But anyways, it was startling.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
 Now, I've gotten pushback on other videos before.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
 Generally, I can expect it coming.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,800
 Anticosmic Satanism, I got a little bit of pushback on.

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,560
 And that was expected, because I was like, I'm talking about someone's belief system.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,800
 I'll probably get some pushback.

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 And they did.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,840
 They called me an idiot and said I should get punched in the head.

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
 And that was it.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,040
 A couple comments over the course of six weeks.

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,000
 And that's when I realized something.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
 This isn't a treasure hunt.

58
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
 This is a cult.

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
 The cults of Forrest Finn.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,040
 They believe in him so much that the second anyone questions it, especially an outsider,

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
 they come out with knives ready.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
 It was incredibly bizarre.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,240
 I do want to say that I'm going to call this segment, get rich or die lying.

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
 Because I think that's what's going on.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,400
 I think that the Forrest Finn treasure is a hoax completely.

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,920
 And I can't believe none of them, they call themselves the fanatics.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 Ridiculous.

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,360
 The fanatics, the clues are in the book to where the treasure is.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,400
 But actually the biggest clue is the title of the book.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,520
 The thrill of the chase.

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,600
 It's all about the search.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
 There is no treasure.

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,920
 There is absolutely no treasure hidden.

74
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,640
 I got in trouble because I used the word buried.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 It's not buried.

76
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
 It's not buried you.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,200
 You bad journalist fake news.

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
 It's hidden.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,400
 So this is the story that they believe.

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,280
 Brief recap is an 80 year old man took a heavy bronze chest filled with artifacts that he

81
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,680
 says are in there, carried it somewhere so it can't be too far away from a main road.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
 But anyways he hiked it away and didn't bury it, which I said multiple times in the original

83
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,080
 story and they were like he didn't bury it.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
 He hid it.

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 Okay.

86
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
 He hid it.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
 And no one's found it for eight years.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,760
 He left a little treasure map.

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,200
 He left this little clues to tell you where it's at and no one can find it.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
 And it's not buried.

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,560
 So it should be fairly visible behind a waterfall, behind a bush, something like that.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
 People have wasted their time, their money.

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 People have died.

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,880
 They've wasted their life following this cult.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
 It's a hoax.

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,580
 It's an absolute hoax and it's in the title of the book, the thrill of the chase.

97
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,780
 He's selling you the adventure, not the treasure.

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,000
 The thrill of the chase.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,920
 Because that's what's important.

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,840
 He sold you the memoir, you're reading his story, he goes on these blogs and gives these

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,120
 interviews and people are like oh my god they get chills up the back of their spine.

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
 That's putting it politely.

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
 This is a family podcast.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
 They're probably doing other things when they hear from Forest Finn, but the story doesn't

105
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
 wash.

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,200
 When people started to question whether or not that this treasure even existed in the

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,680
 first place, Forest Finn miraculously came up with a photo that he had taken in 2010,

108
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
 that I forgot about.

109
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,220
 It was on an old laptop.

110
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,060
 He goes oh I just found a laptop that happened to have a picture of the treasure.

111
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,340
 Here's a photo of it.

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,740
 That's kind of weird that when people are questioning it in the media because people are dying, now

113
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,140
 all of a sudden you find an old photo of it.

114
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,940
 Now again, a skeptic or no, not a skeptic, a normal person would see that and go that's

115
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,100
 kind of odd.

116
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,620
 But the fanatics, like fanatic, but with Finn put into it, ridiculous.

117
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,960
 They believe that oh no, no, this is just more proof.

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,480
 They spend their time and their money and people have died looking for this treasure.

119
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
 It is a cult.

120
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,140
 If you question it, you are immediately castigated for it.

121
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,320
 If you are an outsider, you're a non-believer.

122
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,680
 See, I had to prove that the treasure wasn't buried.

123
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,880
 It wasn't up to them to prove that it was.

124
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,520
 And that's child logic.

125
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,200
 I don't have to prove that Santa Claus doesn't exist.

126
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 You have to prove to me that he does.

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,260
 We're making the extraordinary claim that an 80-year-old man carried a heavy bronze

128
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:48,460
 box full of gold and jewels that he's accumulated over the years and hid it somewhere, not buried

129
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,220
 it, hid it, and it's never been found.

130
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,900
 You have to prove to me that that exists.

131
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,900
 But the cult is so ingrained in this group that any insult to their dear leader is taken

132
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,140
 as the insultor just is morally deficient.

133
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,840
 So I found a list of signs of a cult.

134
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
 And out of the 15 signs, this group has 9.

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
 The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
 Questioning doubt and dissent are discouraged or even punished.

137
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
 The group is elitist, claiming its special exalted status for itself.

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
 See, they're smarter than us.

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,600
 A lot of times on the websites they'll be like, "People who don't believe us just

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,240
 think that they're smarter than the clues.

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
 They should be able to find it.

142
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,820
 If they can't find it, then it doesn't exist."

143
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,340
 No, it doesn't exist because it doesn't exist.

144
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,020
 It doesn't exist because the story doesn't make sense.

145
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
 That's it.

146
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,420
 It doesn't make sense at all.

147
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,060
 If he had buried it, or sorry, hid it, and a week later, somebody found it, or a year

148
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,020
 later, or five years later, maybe.

149
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,380
 But it's been 8 years now.

150
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,660
 He's saying it may not be found for a thousand years.

151
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,020
 It's, yeah, it won't be found in a million years, because it doesn't exist.

152
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,820
 The group has a polarized "us vs. them" mentality.

153
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,920
 Yeah, that's true.

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,280
 Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with friends and families.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
 Not so much, but, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining

156
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,280
 the group, go to the Reddit thread for Forestfen.

157
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
 It's crazy.

158
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,000
 People plan their lives and they'll be like, "Oh, I was up so late.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,080
 Looking at my new "issolve"," that's what they call it.

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 Like, I was looking at my "issolve," and people will post there like, "Hey, I think

161
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,200
 I know what this part of the clue is, and you're an idiot.

162
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 You don't know what that is.

163
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,220
 It's this real insular group."

164
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,200
 And they'll talk about, "Man, I've wasted so much time—sorry, not wasted.

165
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 I've spent so much—well, I think it's waste, but I spent so much time working on

166
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,900
 this and blah, blah, blah."

167
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
 So sad.

168
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,820
 The group is preoccupied with making money is another sign of a cult.

169
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,700
 And I think that's the interesting point, is that Forestfen is a cult leader, but he's

170
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,600
 not selling you eternal salvation.

171
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,760
 He's not a religious cult leader in that sense.

172
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,280
 He's selling you salvation here.

173
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,840
 He is telling you that if you believe in him and follow his word, you can have millions

174
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
 of dollars.

175
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,680
 Like, he's selling you salvation here.

176
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
 So that's the salvation he's selling.

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,040
 And you'll read when you go to these Reddit forums, people talk—they're in money woes.

178
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,480
 They're having money woes, but they get this puzzle and they think they can find this treasure,

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,920
 and they end up spending money to travel out there and will walk around in the bushes for

180
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
 a week.

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,880
 They find nothing because it doesn't exist.

182
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
 And this guy, this Forestfen guy, is totally getting off on this.

183
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,080
 His legacy is completely enshrined.

184
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
 This is what I said on the original episode.

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,160
 A hundred years from now, people will still be looking for this.

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
 It doesn't exist.

187
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,840
 And the sad thing is, Forestfen's name will be remembered a hundred years from now, like

188
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 his treasure.

189
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,240
 But the people who are spending their lives now looking for it, they'll be forgotten.

190
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
 Their legacy is gone.

191
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,820
 They're never going to find it.

192
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,200
 They're never going to stumble upon the box.

193
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,080
 I'm sure they daydream about finding it, and then everyone else on Reddit being jealous

194
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
 that they found it, and then them meeting Forestfen and they're nervous and they're

195
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,520
 shaking his hand for the first time, and then they're on the Ellen show and they tell their

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,760
 story about how they found it.

197
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,960
 This is never going to happen.

198
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
 It's total daydreams.

199
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,280
 The people who are spending their lives looking for this, they will have no legacy.

200
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,640
 Forestfen is almost sucking the life force out of them.

201
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,840
 Colts are insane.

202
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,220
 So you have, I mean, secular Colts can be just as damaging to people.

203
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,140
 And the thing is, the thing about Colts is, people feel, the people who are in Colts are

204
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
 people who are too smart to fall for Colts.

205
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,660
 It's really bizarre.

206
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,780
 You fall, you think that I'm a smart person.

207
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,820
 I can never fall for such hoax.

208
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,420
 And then someone sells you something, and it makes you double down, because you've already

209
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,420
 spent your time and your money and you believe in him so much.

210
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,760
 You can't question it, because if you question it, you're questioning the last eight years

211
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,280
 of your life.

212
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,680
 If you say, you know what, I don't think it existed.

213
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 Basically that is a complete insult to your soul.

214
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,560
 You've put so much into this hoax that when someone puts something forward, it actually

215
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,920
 is insulting to you as an individual because you've bought into this lie.

216
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,520
 Do I think this is going to change anyone's mind?

217
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,420
 I would hope so.

218
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,940
 The reason why I'm doing this segment is because to the people who aren't in a Colt, I think

219
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,300
 it's important to see that these things can pop up anywhere, absolutely anywhere.

220
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:42,220
 I just thought it was interesting because again, it was a starter story.

221
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,580
 It was a story I was like, "Ah, this will be a fun thing to talk about."

222
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:51,160
 And it exposed something dark and raw in a lot of people.

223
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,080
 It doesn't exist, guys.

224
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,120
 It flat out doesn't exist.

225
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,320
 And the sooner that you recognize it doesn't exist and move on and build your legacy, the

226
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,660
 happier you'll be.

227
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,520
 That being said, there is a television series starting about this treasure, so I think there'll

228
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,840
 just be more fanatics in the coming years.

229
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:19,980
 The next story we're going to talk about is fairly dark, so we'll try to keep it light

230
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,220
 as much as we can.

231
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,540
 So this is the story of this takes place in Japan, so we're hopping on the carpenter copter.

232
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,620
 We're leaving Forest Fence Colt compound and they're shooting at us as we're flying away.

233
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,060
 We're like, "Get down!"

234
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,660
 They're throwing fake gold at us as we're flying away from their compound.

235
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,100
 We're taking a trip to Japan.

236
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
 I've never been to Japan.

237
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,820
 I've only seen what it looks like on television.

238
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,820
 It looks pretty dope.

239
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,260
 My little brother's been there, though.

240
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,660
 He said the arcades are awesome.

241
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,940
 But anyway, so the carpenter copter...

242
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,940
 We land in Japan.

243
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,160
 We have to wipe the gold dust off of the rotors, because they did get us a couple times with

244
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,720
 their nuggets.

245
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,680
 And we're going to talk about Tsutomu Miyazaki.

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,400
 So Tsutomu Miyazaki was this young dude.

247
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,080
 Well, obviously, I mean everyone, but I guess not women.

248
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
 But anyway, so he was this young guy.

249
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,100
 When he was born, his hands were fused into his wrist.

250
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,500
 So he had this physical deformity.

251
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,420
 And people made fun of him, because he's growing up and his hands look all gimpy and stuff.

252
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,440
 And so your kids are cruel and they're making fun of him.

253
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
 And so you had a really hard time connecting with people.

254
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,460
 He lost himself into otaku culture.

255
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,140
 Now otaku basically is like...

256
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,360
 It's funny because in America otaku has a different connotation.

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,760
 It's kind of like a nerd.

258
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,880
 You have a magazine called otaku.

259
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,920
 But it's probably closer to the British term "neat."

260
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:54,000
 It's probably closer because neat means not employed in education or training.

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
 So basically it's a loafer.

262
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 It's basically a loafer.

263
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 Neat.

264
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,920
 Otaku in Japan, it's the same thing.

265
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 It's not like, "Oh, look at me.

266
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,400
 I'm a kawaii nerd.

267
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,480
 It's like you're a loser."

268
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,260
 You spend all your time reading comic books and watching cartoons.

269
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,840
 You can do that stuff, but you also have to be a productive member of society.

270
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,260
 Over here it's a little more...

271
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,140
 It has a better meaning, but over there it's like you're a total loser.

272
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,060
 So "Miyazaki" was reading comic books, manga, sorry.

273
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,660
 And then he had a bunch of anime and he was watching horror movies.

274
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,300
 He was really into horror movies.

275
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,680
 Probably the guinea pig series, which is a...

276
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,000
 The guinea pig series is a gore-centered horror.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
 It's basically just people being chopped up.

278
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,960
 Supposedly it looks really realistic.

279
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
 So he was into that.

280
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
 He was into horror movies.

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He was reading manga.

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
 That was pretty much all he did.

283
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,760
 His father was fairly successful in the town and wanted him to take over the business.

284
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,960
 And Miyazaki was like, "No, I don't want to do that."

285
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,840
 So people were giving him opportunities to move forward with his life.

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,660
 His grandfather... he was closest to his grandfather.

287
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,420
 And his grandfather died.

288
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,620
 And this is really the start of when all this breaks down.

289
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,980
 And this story takes place in the 80s.

290
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,660
 His grandfather dies and it was the only person that he ever felt really close to.

291
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,300
 And so Miyazaki, when no one was looking, ate some of his ashes.

292
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,580
 Yeah, we're going there.

293
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,020
 And then he started to have other behavioral problems.

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,460
 At one point he was caught spying on his sister taking a shower.

295
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,600
 And when she confronted him, he attacked her.

296
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,040
 And then the mom came and started yelling at him and he attacked her too.

297
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,240
 So the guys obviously little mentally unbalanced.

298
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,880
 Least of all attacking the women, taking the showers and all that stuff.

299
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,280
 Most of all eating the ashes.

300
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:50,400
 What happens is between August 1988 and June of 1989, this kid, this physically deformed

301
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:58,020
 kid who had it rough growing up and was in a society where work was highly valued and

302
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,580
 he just wanted to sit around and read comic books and watch horror movies.

303
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,980
 Something sparks in him.

304
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,020
 And he decides to go, "Okay, I can either get a job, sit around and read comic books

305
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,940
 and just keep doing what I'm doing or start murdering people."

306
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,300
 So over the course of a year, he murders four little girls between the ages of four and

307
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,020
 seven.

308
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,000
 And commits acts like necrophilia and cannibalism and trophies.

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,560
 He takes their feet home.

310
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,560
 He starts sending letters to the family of the girls.

311
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,600
 One of them said, "Mari, cremated bones investigate proof."

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,960
 So the guy is a real dick.

313
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,600
 And eventually he is caught trying to pick up his fifth victim.

314
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,300
 The dad finds him doing stuff with this girl and basically chases him down and then calls

315
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 the cops.

316
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 He gets arrested.

317
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,820
 He's completely emotionalist, surprise, surprise and trial.

318
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,180
 His father kills himself out of shame of the whole affair.

319
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,020
 And he's eventually hung by the government.

320
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,660
 And there was a bit of a controversy because when they were taking photos of his apartment

321
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,620
 for evidence, they had rows and rows and rows of these manga and some of it was mainstream

322
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,200
 but some of it was more controversial stuff.

323
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,580
 And then his horror movies.

324
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,920
 And people said that the government was trying to make Otaku culture look bad.

325
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,840
 And that stuff was inserted by the crime scene people, which is an insane conspiracy theory.

326
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,320
 I don't think they have buckets of "hey dude go get those Lum comic books, we're gonna

327
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,600
 stick them in this guy's shelves, they'll make him look like a lunatic."

328
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,960
 No, he had it.

329
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,880
 And he was dubbed the Otaku killer.

330
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,900
 The little girl killer was another nickname of his.

331
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
 That's an overview.

332
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,260
 I don't like to dwell, especially crimes against children.

333
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,260
 I don't want to be like, "oh and then he crept into the backseat and with a layering look."

334
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,420
 And that's not this kind of podcast.

335
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,820
 Like again, there are certain stories where I think that stuff is important, but I don't

336
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,460
 think it's important to this story.

337
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,700
 I'll talk about that when I'm talking about like Bigfoot getting shot by Patterson Gimlin.

338
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,740
 But again, I don't think that's important to this particular story.

339
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,920
 I think what's important to this story is two things.

340
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:17,080
 One, it is very easy to go from being an outsider to slipping out of reality.

341
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 It's very, very easy.

342
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,680
 I almost feel like our brain tricks us into that.

343
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,840
 What happens is you start off by removing yourself little by little from human interactions

344
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,320
 with people for good or bad reasons.

345
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,800
 There may be reasons why you're like, "you know what, I don't want to hang out in my

346
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,160
 house anymore.

347
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,660
 My parents are abusive.

348
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,180
 My sister is doing this."

349
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
 Whatever.

350
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,780
 So it's not always a bad thing to kind of step out.

351
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,860
 But what happens is people will start to step out too far.

352
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,540
 And then let's say that you're having trouble at your home life and then you start hanging

353
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,580
 out with homeless kids, which I've had a lot of interactions with.

354
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,340
 And that was their new family.

355
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,940
 So even though they had stepped out of the bounds of "normal society," they now had a

356
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,280
 new family with new rules and new senses of loyalty and new things to do and to follow

357
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
 and to entertain them.

358
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,480
 But the thing is, is that you will sometimes also move out of that social bubble.

359
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
 And you keep moving.

360
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,760
 So you're basically, you encapsulate yourself in, you are your own social network.

361
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,600
 And it's when that loneliness takes over, is when you start to feel like you can do anything.

362
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,060
 That's when reality truly breaks for you.

363
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,740
 Because you have no social ties whatsoever.

364
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,340
 You don't want to have social ties with mainstream society.

365
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
 That's fine.

366
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,020
 You can find social ties in other places.

367
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,440
 We're a social species.

368
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,980
 And we should be bound to each other in one way or the other.

369
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,420
 I think the internet is a double-edged sword.

370
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,820
 I think it can make people find social groups.

371
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,180
 They didn't know that we're out there.

372
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,500
 And that's really good.

373
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,480
 And I think it can isolate people even more.

374
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,980
 Because they go on the internet and they see all these people who they presume are having

375
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,920
 better lives than them and it makes them feel like even more of an outsider.

376
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,920
 I think the internet is great for building social networks and I think that's a great

377
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
 tool for it.

378
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,320
 And here's a fun fact about me.

379
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,800
 I'm actually more shy online than I am in real life.

380
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,440
 In real life, I will walk up to a total stranger and start a conversation.

381
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
 All the time.

382
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 Online, I lurk.

383
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
 I very rarely interact with people online.

384
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,460
 I'm actually more shy online than I am in real life.

385
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,380
 And I think it's because when I'm talking to someone in real life, I can look at them

386
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,260
 and I can read them and I can tell how engaged they are in the conversation and whether or

387
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,700
 not they want to keep talking to me or whether or not they're lying to me or whatever thing.

388
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,100
 I'm really good at reading body language.

389
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,380
 Online, that's all gone.

390
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,900
 I'm very, very shy online.

391
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,820
 But I think for most people, it's the reverse.

392
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,480
 So a key component, especially for you or if you're seeing people stepping out of the

393
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,680
 like cutting those social bonds to an extreme degree, that's where we have trouble like

394
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 this.

395
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,720
 This guy, and people tried helping him.

396
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,440
 And he kept pulling himself further and further away from that social group that is important

397
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,920
 to us as apes, as social animals.

398
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,400
 So I would hope that if you find yourself doing that, there is a social group out there

399
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
 for you.

400
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,460
 And hopefully your social group isn't budding serial killers.

401
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,980
 That would be an actual, probably bad social group.

402
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,180
 But if you find yourself cutting the ties to society, your best bet is to go.

403
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,620
 Instead of saying, "I don't like my home life or I don't like the church or I don't

404
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,380
 like politics or this political party," or whatever, instead of saying, "I'm going to

405
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,900
 throw it all away," say, "I'm going to find another group that I think I'll fit better

406
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,940
 with."

407
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,740
 That's really your best bet.

408
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,660
 And if you can't, then try to find a group online.

409
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,640
 My second thing that I want to talk about, and I'm going to have to dedicate a whole

410
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,320
 segment to this of why I just don't like serial killers to begin with, but I'm going

411
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,000
 to address it very shortly here.

412
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,520
 I don't like serial killers because they attack the weakest of the weak.

413
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,480
 They are not hunters of men.

414
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,800
 They are not the dark side of humanity.

415
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,680
 They're limp-dicked punks who kill women, who kill elderly people, and who kill children.

416
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,100
 They're not killing UFC fighters or Marines.

417
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,460
 They're not chasing down bodybuilders and boxing them.

418
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
 No.

419
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,380
 Ted Bundy is tricking young, naive, good-hearted women to come to a cabin with him.

420
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,700
 Oh my God.

421
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,620
 Call up a movie producer.

422
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,660
 We have to make a movie about that.

423
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,580
 That is the darkest side of humanity.

424
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,100
 No, you can't get it up.

425
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,940
 Limp-dick wasn't just a turn of phrase.

426
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,080
 You literally can't get a hard on unless you're killing somebody, and they're always somebody

427
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,160
 weaker than you.

428
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,440
 Who reminded you of your mom or your ex-girlfriend.

429
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 Yeah, I'm really impressed by you guys.

430
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 Absolutely.

431
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 It's ridiculous.

432
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,480
 Now, I'm probably going to get an email from a serial killer, but they'll say, "Well, I

433
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
 kill Marines."

434
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,840
 Okay, I'm sure there is one serial killer out there who has killed a bunch of Marines, but

435
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,720
 I would be shocked.

436
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,280
 And then I was talking about this with Veronica, and she said, "Well, what about Jeffrey Dahmer?

437
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
 He killed men."

438
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,500
 And I go, "Yeah, he killed very skinny men.

439
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,780
 He killed young men.

440
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,340
 One of his victims was 16 years old.

441
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,820
 And he had to drug them.

442
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,660
 He brought them over to their house because they wanted to have sex, and then he drugged

443
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,900
 them and they fell asleep, and he chopped them up, or drilled a hole in their brain actually.

444
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,300
 So again, you're not going toe-to-toe with these guys.

445
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,900
 That's why I said, and I go, "I'll give, you know, like you have hit men, and you have

446
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,820
 gang bangers, and you have stuff like that."

447
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,840
 And they may be, in essence, a serial killer because they're killing multiple people, but

448
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,280
 a hit man's not like, "Hey, I only have one rule.

449
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
 I only kill women and children."

450
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,120
 You're like, "No."

451
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,440
 They're like, "My rule is I'm going to take down that target.

452
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,680
 You have the gang banger and being like, "That guy owes us money and he's not paying up?

453
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
 Okay."

454
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,720
 He may go, "I'll go kill his wife and stuff like that," but that's not his, that's not

455
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,960
 their modus operandi.

456
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,760
 They'll be, one day they may be out like shooting some chick who witnessed a crime.

457
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,340
 And the next day they're having a running gun battle with a rival gang.

458
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,220
 So the mentality is different.

459
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,180
 I'm not saying all killers are like that, but the idea of the serial killer itself, they're

460
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,160
 all victims are always women.

461
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,620
 The victims are always kids.

462
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,620
 The victims are always elderly people.

463
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,580
 And then the times that you do have male victims, it tends to be like Erba Meister.

464
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,100
 He would bring guys over to his house to have sex with, and he'd be like, "Hey, let's play

465
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,840
 this game where I put this rope around your neck and you pass out and it's really hot."

466
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,920
 And then people would be like, "Uh, yeah, sure."

467
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,040
 So he's not like fighting them, there's no struggle.

468
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,560
 He just tricks them.

469
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,640
 Same thing with that idiot clown guy, John Wayne Gacy.

470
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,800
 And he was killing boys.

471
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,920
 So again, you know, there's no UFC slaughterer.

472
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,560
 There's no New York police detective, you know, strangler.

473
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,000
 Because the serial killers would get their ass stomped in every single fight with someone

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,800
 who could put up a reasonable fight.

475
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,540
 A 90-pound woman that Ted Bundy is tricking into his car is not a threat to Ted Bundy.

476
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,560
 King Kong Bundy is a threat to Ted Bundy.

477
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,300
 And that's why they pick the victims they do.

478
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,940
 And that's why I have, I would say, non-existent respect for a serial killer.

479
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,020
 I think they're lame.

480
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,660
 So that was my rant for the day.

481
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,620
 I'm gonna do this last story really quick because I want to end on a light note again.

482
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,140
 And I have to admit, after the last two stories, I need a light note.

483
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,840
 The story I read about it was oddly sexual to me.

484
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,480
 I found it very intriguing.

485
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,240
 And it's quite simple, but very, very hot.

486
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
 Maybe I was just in a weird mood.

487
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,280
 Nah, I do think it's hot.

488
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,120
 This is from an article entitled, "I secretly fanned up my bridesmaids before my wedding."

489
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 Uh-huh.

490
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 A conspiracy.

491
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,640
 I'll fit it in there some way if I have to.

492
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,140
 This woman, she's getting married.

493
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,760
 And she has these beautiful sisters.

494
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,060
 And she is going to get married.

495
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,380
 And her sisters are going to be her bridesmaids.

496
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,620
 But she started to think, she goes, "My sisters have always been, you know, we've always

497
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,700
 been really competitive.

498
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,100
 My sisters are very, very pretty.

499
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,660
 I want to have the perfect wedding.

500
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,020
 And I want to have the perfect wedding photos."

501
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,340
 So what she started doing was first off, so they're all three girls.

502
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,540
 It's her, she's the middle child.

503
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,340
 They're all blond, they all have fair skin.

504
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,420
 And she picked for bridesmaids dresses neon yellow.

505
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,760
 So it made them look super washed out and gross and like ill.

506
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,320
 It made them look, their skin have a weird sheen to it.

507
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,400
 And then she started making breath fix, I can't say the word.

508
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
 Damn it.

509
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,160
 She started making, I didn't know this word was in the article.

510
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,480
 She started making them breakfast smoothies.

511
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,200
 And she bought a container of weight loss shake and emptied it out and then added in

512
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,360
 a mega weight gain protein powder into it.

513
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,340
 And she was making them and she's like, "Oh, these smoothies are just a good way to start

514
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,180
 the day and we're going to do this."

515
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,940
 So her sisters started getting chubby and they couldn't figure it out.

516
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,620
 And she, her one, her smoothie was just fruit and coconut water.

517
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,180
 So the end result was the two sisters had to have their dresses altered.

518
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,220
 They put on so much, they didn't get like big mama's house fat, but they put on enough

519
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,860
 weight, their dresses had to be altered.

520
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,380
 And she's like, "I had a great time.

521
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,100
 The photos came out great."

522
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,000
 And both my sisters lost the weight relatively quickly because they stopped drinking the

523
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 smoothies.

524
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,240
 Once the wedding was over and, but they've been like, "Oh man, those smoothies were

525
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 so good.

526
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
 What's your recipe?"

527
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 Like since then.

528
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,920
 And so this, I thought it was a fun story.

529
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,600
 And technically is a conspiracy where she, and that is the definition of a conspiracy.

530
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,880
 She has this secret plan to enact against other people.

531
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,520
 And it's, I read the article and I'm like, "This is, this is vaguely, I find this vaguely

532
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 erotic."

533
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,920
 And I don't know if it's erotic because I like diabolical women.

534
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,080
 Not like diabolical women, like I'm going to murder you for your drug money, but just

535
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:09,880
 kind of like slightly manipulative, slightly kind of like, I pulled one over on him like

536
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
 that.

537
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
 I don't, to a slight degree, I don't want to attract a bunch of psychos into my life.

538
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,020
 I don't know if that's the attractive part or the idea of these thin women slowly getting

539
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,020
 plump.

540
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,380
 I don't, and their dress is getting tighter.

541
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
 I don't know.

542
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,620
 I don't have like a weight gain fetish.

543
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,520
 But this whole article, I was like, "Hmm, that's a new one.

544
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,180
 Maybe I'll, you know, this is vaguely, this is quite erotic."

545
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,380
 So I wanted to put it in the show.

546
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,240
 So I had an excuse to read it again.

547
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,520
 And technically, technically it is a conspiracy.

548
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,000

 Please I don't, I've seen it.

552
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
 That's again, that's not my thing.

553
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,140
 I just, I like tight dresses.

554
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,620
 I like dresses that are too tight, actually.

555
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,020
 I have a thing for that, but where was I going?

556
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,060
 Twitter is @jasonocarpenter.

557
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,100
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

558
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,540
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

559
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 Have a great one, guys.

560
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
 That was a good episode.

561
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
 You should do it.

562
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,540
 You should do, you should send me stuff and then join my cult.

563
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,460
 It's called Dead Rabbit Radio cult.

564
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:35,180
 And I have a treasure that is hidden and it is, I will write a poem and it will tell you

565
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,860
 where the treasure is at, but you'll just have to believe me that there is really a

566
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,900
 treasure because I am an honorable person.

567
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,780
 So you will have to take my word for it.

568
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,940
 Thank you for listening and insert hypnotic noises here that I cannot make because I

569
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
 am not a hypnotist.

570
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:53,940
 Have a great day.

571
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,180
 It's a great day.
