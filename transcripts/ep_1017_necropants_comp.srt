1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 If you can't trust the headless horseman, who can you trust?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,580
 And then we travel to Iceland to take a look at a cursed artifact known as the Necropants.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,640
 Is it possible that whether or not you are financially successful all comes down to who's

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
 skin you're in?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:32,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,960
 I hope you guys have lots of plans for the weekend or maybe not.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
 Maybe you're just sitting at home relaxing.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,760
 That's what I like to do.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,560
 And someone who's always relaxed except that he's currently trapped in a pair of Necropants

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,760
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,400
 He's continuing his journey from yesterday.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 Everyone give it up for Jonah.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 Woohoo!

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
 Yeah walk on in.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,320
 Walk on in buddy to Dead Rabbit Command and take a seat.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,400
 Not that chair because you're wearing a dead man's skin.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
 But just stand up.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
 Just stand up.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
 It's probably better for all of us.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,160
 Jonah you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally get it.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 I really do.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,880
 I've said it a thousand and fifteen times.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,600
 But I mean it just helps spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 That helps out so much.

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,360
 And that's a perfect segue into today's fan art Friday submission.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,600
 Look at this.

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 This is a flyer made up by Finn.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,440
 Finn loves Dead Rabbit Radio so much that he designed his own flyer and he's been putting

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 it up around his hometown.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,240
 I'm pretty sure there's nothing in this photo that he can be doxed in.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,640
 I'm sure all over the world there are people wearing green shirts and biking down the

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
 road.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,600
 But I guess if you see one of these signs in your neighborhood then you know Finn's

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 around.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,640
 But anyways Finn redesigned the flyer and he made a QR code that takes you right to

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,160
 DeadRabberRadio.Libson.com which is our main source of like if you're just looking for

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,320
 the podcast that's where to go.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
 And that's awesome.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,480
 That's exactly what I'm talking about.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 Spreading the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 It helps out so much.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,320
 And Finn thank you so much.

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
 That's really cool.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
 And it looks very sunny there.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,560
 I'm assuming this photo was taken months ago.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,760
 Jonah let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,320
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:38,680
 Everyone grabbing on his waist as he glides us all the way out to Georgia.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,240
 We're actually in Georgia yesterday talking about the ghost chasers.

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,880
 I went on a bit of a rant and that's why Jonah gets an extra episode because he didn't

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,160
 get a chance to fly the Carbenter counter.

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
 No rants this episode.

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 No rants incoming.

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,160
 We're going to just check out.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,840
 This is a very very peculiar haunting.

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,320
 This is why I love doing this show.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,280
 It's finding stuff like this.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,040
 I've never come across anything like this.

63
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:13,400
 I will say there is a possibility that the reason why this is so odd is there's a typo.

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,160
 But let's take a look at it.

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,560
 Look at it either way.

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,400
 Either someone wrote the ghost story out wrong and left out a key word or this is a one of

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,880
 a kind event.

68
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,520
 We're in Dalton, Georgia.

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,200
 If you're in the area you can check this out yourself.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,080
 If you do find anything I get half.

71
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,000
 Between Chatsworth and Dalton, between the cities of Chatsworth and Dalton, near the

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,920
 Mitchell Bridge Road is a graveyard.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
 Now I'll say this.

74
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,360
 I did try finding this location myself.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,800
 I wanted all the gold for myself.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,680
 I guess I should have given away that this is gold related.

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
 I could not find a graveyard in this area.

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
 I was looking on Google Earth for this.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
 But it might be one of those old timey graveyards that have basically just become absorbed into

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
 a house.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 You certainly know how there's new houses.

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
 You know how there's new housing developments.

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,880
 You just build them on top of graveyards.

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
 Like folder guys.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,760
 It may be like underneath some trees.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,960
 It may be like a really small graveyard.

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,680
 I couldn't pick anything out via satellite.

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,640
 But you guys, if you're in the area, you guys might be able to figure this out.

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,360
 Apparently, there's a graveyard over off of Mitchell Bridge Road.

90
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
 It's a pretty big road though.

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,440
 So I mean, I looked but I couldn't see anything.

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:40,720
 Legend says that when the conditions are just right, you need it to be late at night.

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,760
 You need it to be foggy.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,900
 And there needs to be a rainstorm.

95
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,880
 So all three of those things need to be happening at the same time.

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,920
 If you're out on this road near this graveyard, thick fog is surrounding you.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,240
 It's raining late at night.

98
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,480
 You will or may, I guess I should have really chased an event out of here every day for the

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 past three years.

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,520
 I haven't seen anything.

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,200
 You may see a headless horseman.

102
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:27,000
 This ghastly specter is what was once a wealthy man in the area who died via decapitation.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,080
 Head rolling down the street.

104
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 You know, it's interesting because every so often I come across an article, "What

105
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,840
 newspapers do you possibly read that this happens every so often?"

106
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,920
 Every so often I come across an article that talks about can the brain be conscious that

107
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,280
 it's been decapitated?

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,040
 If you cut off somebody's head or it happens in an accident, something like that, right?

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,120
 Will the person know they've been decapitated?

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,600
 Whenever I read that, I go, "Obviously, yeah, you would.

111
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 You would know."

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 You would know.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,840
 Your head was removed from your body suddenly.

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
 You're not like, "See you later, consciousness."

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:14,800
 There is a moment where all of a sudden, I'm looking straight ahead and the next thing

116
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
 I know, I'm looking up at the sky, ground, sky, ground.

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,760
 I got mud in my nose and I'm like, "Oh, what just happened?"

118
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
 Then I would die.

119
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,160
 There would be a moment where you would realize that your head had been removed from your

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
 body.

121
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,840
 I'm sure it's pretty scary.

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,400
 Right on the scale of things that would be terrifying, realizing you've been decapitated

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,680
 ranks probably number one, honestly, right?

124
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,160
 But I'm sure.

125
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,680
 It would be ridiculous to think that, no, once you get decapitated, you immediately stop

126
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
 being conscious.

127
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
 Immediately.

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,440
 There would be a second or two, at least, where you would know.

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
 You probably want to feel the mud on your face.

130
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,160
 I think maybe your nerve endings stopped working, but maybe not.

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,800
 Maybe you can roll around in the mud a bit.

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,040
 You suffocate after you get your head chopped off.

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,360
 You land face first in the mud.

134
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
 You're like, "Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh."

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Sinking into a swamp.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
 Of course you would know.

137
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,480
 Of course you would be aware that your head was flying around.

138
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,280
 I remember there's that famous story about the guy who got his head chopped off by the

139
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,520
 guillotine and they picked it up out of the basket.

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,920
 This is like old timey France.

141
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,880
 Like French Revolution France.

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
 He actually, they didn't pick his head up out of the basket.

143
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,760
 The corpse, well, guillotine comes down, chops off the guy's head.

144
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,440
 His head rolls in the basket and then his own body picks up his head and he uses the

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
 head to kiss his bloody stump.

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,280
 That's not true.

147
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,240
 That wouldn't work that way.

148
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,680
 But I've also heard stories about people who have been decapitated and people who are

149
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
 on the scene.

150
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,520
 Like they didn't show up a couple minutes later.

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,920
 Like they watched this guy get decapitated.

152
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,280
 They said often there's a look of anguish on the head.

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
 It goes, "Whoa."

154
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 Like it's scared.

155
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
 It's, it's scared.

156
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,400
 It's been removed from its body and I've read articles and they go, "Oh no, that's just

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,240
 nerve, that's just, that's just nerve-in-thing to firing in a way to make it look like he's

158
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
 scared."

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
 They're not actually scared.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,840
 These heads aren't scared.

161
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
 It just looks like that.

162
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 It just looks like he's terrified.

163
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,720
 Well, that's a pretty specific thing.

164
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,280
 It's not like anyone's head ever gets chopped off and the synapses randomly make it look

165
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,000
 like they're having a really good time.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 It's general anguish.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,800
 But anyways, now that I've terrified all of you from ever working in anywhere with a

168
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,880
 forklift, let's go back to this story.

169
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,240
 I'll see if I can find any of those articles that I've run across every once in a while

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,000
 about due decapitated heads and how they've been decapitated.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,680
 But back to this one, this wealthy man dies in this area via decapitation and, you know,

172
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,800
 this is an old time, this is one of those stories.

173
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
 We have a very specific location.

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,560
 Well, it may not exist, but we have a very specific location in this graveyard between

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,400
 Chatsworth and Dalton on Mitchell Bridge Road.

176
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,900
 But we don't have a time period.

177
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,880
 We don't have a name of the wealthy man, anything like that.

178
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,400
 But I'm assuming old timey because this guy, he didn't have his fortune tied up in Wells

179
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 Fargo Bank or anything like that.

180
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,120
 He buried it.

181
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,520
 That was the bank of the old ones.

182
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
 He buried your money.

183
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,320
 You didn't get a lot of return on your investment, but you also didn't get shot in the belly

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
 because someone wanted some gold.

185
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,640
 Well, I guess this guy got decapitated.

186
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,540
 You didn't work out too well for him, but you bury your gold or your treasure and no

187
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,880
 one's ever found this wealthy man's treasure.

188
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:04,200
 Well, I came across this story on theshadowlands.net, which is a great website if you're into ghosts.

189
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,200
 And I recommend it to people all the time who are into ghosts.

190
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,880
 Let me read you exactly what it says on theshadowlands.net.

191
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,320
 I was able to find this story in one other place, but, you know, sometimes they may have

192
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
 also got it from theshadowlands.net.

193
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 Let me read this to you.

194
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,800
 It says, "There was a guy that was buried in the graveyard that was killed by decapitation

195
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,880
 that was said to be rich and buried his money somewhere.

196
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,240
 On a rainy, stormy, foggy night, you will see a headless horseman and he will chase

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
 you."

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,440
 It's pretty standard for these types of events, chasing you.

199
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,280
 If you're on a horse, you might as well, right?

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,920
 You might as well chase down people.

201
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,880
 If you had to, like, do it yourself, you'd be like, "I'll just float here for a little

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,760
 bit and then disappear."

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,800
 On a rainy, stormy, foggy night, you will see a headless horseman and he will chase

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,840
 you to tell you where the money is buried.

205
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:08,720
 Now, it's possible that whoever wrote this meant to say he will chase you away from

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,360
 the money because that is the account of pretty much every other treasure specter out there.

207
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,760
 We covered one recently, the Glauchester Ghoul.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 They're all over the place.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,840
 We hear these stories about phantoms protecting pirates booty and glowing skeletons protecting

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,080
 lost mines and things like that in New Mexico, Arizona, or somewhere down there.

211
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,320
 Very, very common specter.

212
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
 This one, this is a huge gambit too.

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,960
 This is a big thing to leave up to chance that the Shadowlands.net got it right because

214
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,440
 if you happen to be out in this area late at night, it's rainy, it's foggy, and all

215
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,000
 of a sudden you hear, "Hahaha, it's not the Crypt Keeper.

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It's not the Crypt Keeper.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
 Don't get your autograph books ready."

218
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,720
 You turn around, there's a horse, and on it is the man with no head, and he begins chasing

219
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,880
 you.

220
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
 You have to think, do I, you're like pondering this as he's trampling you to death.

221
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,640
 You're like, "Well, I guess this was wrong."

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,080
 You can start running while you think about it, but you can go, "Okay, so wait a second.

223
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,640
 I heard about this on Dead Ravv Radio.

224
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,800
 Do I stop and let this phantom catch up to me, assuming that the Shadowlands.net got

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,440
 it right, and once he catches up to me," because he doesn't tell you, he doesn't just appear

226
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,720
 behind you and go, "Look over there."

227
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
 He chases you.

228
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,000
 He actively goes into pursuit, and if he catches up to you, he will tell you where his treasure

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 is buried.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
 There's just, there doesn't seem right about this.

231
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
 There's just, there's something doesn't seem right about this headless ghost chasing you

232
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,640
 down the road.

233
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,760
 You figure if he really wanted you to know, maybe he wants it to go to the fastest of

234
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 foot.

235
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,840
 Maybe he wants to know, "Hey, son, you outran, you outran my horse of the damned.

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,880
 I think you deserve a little something something.

237
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,680
 I got some gold over there."

238
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,120
 Apparently he chases you, and then you have to decide, "I am going to keep running away.

239
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,040
 I'm going to run to the dry cleaners and drop my pants off, or I want to stop in the middle

240
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,880
 of this darkened road and let him catch up to me, and he will tell me where his treasure

241
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
 is."

242
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,920
 Super, if this isn't a typo, it's super bizarre.

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 I'm trying to think of a similar ghost that leads you to treasure.

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,800
 There are spirits that have led people out of disaster.

245
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,760
 He tends to call those guardian angels, but there's also stories of that.

246
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,880
 So not, even like you have a guardian angel that's a instantaneous phenomenon.

247
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,520
 I'm trying to think of a ghost that appears in an area regularly.

248
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,800
 Yeah, actually, we, off the top of my head, I don't remember the exact circumstances,

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,160
 but there have been ghosts that have appeared before big storms.

250
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,000
 And so people would know, "Hey, a big storm's coming in.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
 We saw Angela, Angela on the rock."

252
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,960
 She appears every time a giant storm rolls in because her lover died in a boat crash

253
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
 or whatever.

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,880
 Not super common, but we do see stories like that as well.

255
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,320
 I don't think I've ever seen one where a ghost tries to lead you to his buried treasure.

256
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,680
 So my instinct tells me that this is a typo, that this was put out wrong, but again, that's

257
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,960
 the thing with the world of the paranormal.

258
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:38,720
 There are all sorts of stories, and you can't necessarily say they all have to be exactly

259
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
 the same.

260
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,480
 So I find it very interesting that he may lead you to the treasure.

261
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
 I do have to say the only way someone would know about this is if they tried it.

262
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,920
 They just didn't have it in them to run that night.

263
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,600
 They're like, "I would ever, I've lived a good life.

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 This is how I die.

265
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,200
 I'm just going to stand here."

266
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,160
 And then the ghost would catch up to him and go, "Uh, good sir, you have proven that you

267
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
 are the fastest around."

268
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,960
 And you're like, "I actually didn't try."

269
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,720
 And the ghost is like, "Ah, anyways, my treasure is over there."

270
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,920
 And that person who lived to tell this tale would have went and dug up the treasure.

271
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,960
 Would have gotten it, right?

272
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,040
 So he may come back into town and be like, "Hey, you won't believe what happened to me.

273
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
 There is, I mean, you literally won't believe this.

274
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
 It sounds unbelievable."

275
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,320
 I was chased down the street by the head of the swordsman.

276
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,680
 He showed me where his treasure was and here it is.

277
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,120
 Puts a little treasure chest up on the table.

278
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,520
 That means there would be nothing left, right?

279
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,120
 There'd be nothing left for anyone else.

280
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,600
 Like he could tell that tale, but if you did happen to get caught by the head of the swordsman,

281
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,760
 eventually he catches up to you and just kind of shrugs and goes, "Well, it used to be over

282
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 there."

283
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:55,200
 Unless, what if, put on our conspiracy caps here, wrap this part up.

284
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,480
 What if, I mean, I'm just kind of, this is just kind of making stuff up.

285
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,280
 This takes more than a conspiracy cap.

286
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,720
 What if every time the head of the swordsman catches up to you, if you dug up the treasure,

287
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 a new treasure manifests in its place.

288
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,120
 And so for each person, if they get caught by the head of the swordsman, there's more

289
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,280
 gold.

290
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
 The gold is replaced for them.

291
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 And it's not some Twilight Zone thing where you're like, "Oh, right, I got my gold."

292
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,680
 And then you're like, "Why does my head feel so funny?"

293
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,200
 "Oh, and it rolls off."

294
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
 And then you become the next head of the swordsman.

295
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 I'm not talking about that.

296
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,120
 I'm talking about like, if I stole 10,000 doubloons from this, I didn't steal it.

297
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,560
 I didn't steal it just to be clear, ghost jury.

298
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
 I didn't steal it.

299
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 He told me where I was at.

300
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,360
 I got 10,000 doubloons from Headless Horseman.

301
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,280
 And then a week later, you go out there, you dug up, you would find another treasure chest

302
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,680
 full of another 10,000 doubloons.

303
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,360
 Because at the end of the day, he's a ghost, right?

304
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
 This is some sort of spirit.

305
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,040
 He's not going to be like, "Oh, sorry, I don't have any money left."

306
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,880
 If he can manifest his body, ghosts are known for manifesting coins out of nowhere that

307
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,800
 it's not super common, paranormal phenomenon, but it's less rare than a lot of other ones.

308
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,320
 So it's possible that this ghost can not only make you rich, but can make everybody rich.

309
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,600
 I'm going to drive a bunch of tourism to Mitchell Bridge Road.

310
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,360
 I do have to say too, in Shadowlands.net, they do not specify...

311
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,080
 If you do go out to this area, they do not specify Mitchell Bridge Road.

312
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,320
 It's Mitchell Bridge, but I couldn't find that either.

313
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,640
 I could only find Mitchell Bridge Road, but I'd be really curious.

314
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,640
 I'd be very curious if any of you guys go check this out.

315
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,600
 And are pursued at their live stream at Live Stream at Azure being chased by this Headless

316
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,040
 Horse Ghost.

317
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
 And let us know.

318
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,120
 Let us know if you find the treasure, or let us know if your live stream just goes dark

319
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,200
 as a hoof crushes your phone.

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,960
 Either or works for us.

321
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,120
 Jonah, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbon helicopter we are leaving behind

322
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
 Georgia.

323
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
 Fly us all the way out to Iceland.

324
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,000
 Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,520
 First off, I want to give a shout out to Slinks Slowdown, the other person who posted about

327
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
 this story.

328
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
 I'd never heard anything like this.

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
 This is absolutely fascinating.

330
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,720
 Well, I can't say I've never heard anything like it.

331
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,760
 We've covered magical artifacts in the past.

332
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,440
 I think it's one of my favorite episodes.

333
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,960
 It's very, very early episodes.

334
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,080
 It's in the first 100 episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio.

335
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 It was about the hand of glory.

336
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,600
 The original Infinity Gauntlet, I think is the name of the episode, or the real Infinity

337
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 Gauntlet.

338
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,240
 It was a magical artifact that you had to super complicated, super complicated to make.

339
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,160
 But if you had one, you were basically invincible.

340
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,960
 You had to get a human hand from a murderer, like a murderer who had been executed.

341
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,680
 You needed to dig his hand up or cut it freshly from his corpse as he's rotting in a cage.

342
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,400
 That's just the beginning.

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,480
 You had to like wrap it in baby fat or something like that.

344
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,880
 It was absolutely insane.

345
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,840
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

346
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's a crazy relic.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,840
 This falls along the same lines.

348
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,200
 The hand of glory was something you had to make.

349
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
 What it would allow you to do was break into people's houses and it would put everyone

350
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,680
 to sleep in the house.

351
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
 That was one of its main components.

352
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,840
 It had other abilities, but you could walk into the house.

353
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
 Everyone would fall asleep.

354
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 You could take everything.

355
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,800
 It was a thieves weapon.

356
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,320
 So very, very interesting.

357
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,040
 I'll put it in the show notes.

358
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,680
 But Iceland has a couple things like that.

359
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,400
 That was Northern European.

360
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,960
 This one, we're in Iceland.

361
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,360
 There's a couple different things like this.

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,120
 First off, let's say you're thirsty one day.

363
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,360
 It's old timey Iceland.

364
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,760
 It's the 1700s and you're parched.

365
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,040
 You are living on a giant island, so I'm sure you can just go down to the good old ocean

366
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,080
 and drink some of that.

367
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 Probably not.

368
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 Probably not.

369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,200
 I don't know how salty the water is around Iceland, but let's say you didn't want to.

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,880
 Let's say you're too lazy to walk out to the well and get some water or to walk to the

371
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,680
 ocean and get some water.

372
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,840
 You could create a tillberry.

373
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,920
 What you need, the first thing you need is a pair of ample bosoms.

374
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,680
 So that's usually women create these things.

375
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,840
 But you need a big pair of boobs, which I honestly think is the best way to start any

376
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
 smell, right?

377
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:33,960
 You need a big pair of boobs and then you need to steal a rib, a rib bone from a corpse.

378
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,160
 So you got the boobs and you're like, "I'll be back in a second, honey."

379
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
 You got to go down to the graveyard.

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,560
 And this is all just to get a drink.

381
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,440
 I know life was harsh in 1700s Iceland, but you go down to the graveyard, you steal a

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,200
 rib and I love it because these spells are so mean-spirited as well.

383
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,040
 These magical artifacts are so cruel.

384
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,680
 Then you have to wrap it in gray wool, but not just any gray wool.

385
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,800
 You have to steal it from a sheep.

386
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,400
 You have to steal the wool from the sheep of a widow.

387
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,960
 So this woman, "Oh, I can't believe my husband, oh, fully it stayed hydrated but he was too

388
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,800
 lazy to get a drink of water.

389
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Poo-hoo."

390
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,280
 While she's sobbing over her dead lover, you break in her her farm and steal some wool

391
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
 from a sheep.

392
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,400
 It has to be gray wool.

393
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 I don't know if there's gray sheep.

394
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
 I don't know if you have to dye it after that.

395
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,200
 But anyways, really at this point I'm nitpicking small details because this thing's about to

396
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 become horrendous.

397
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,120
 You take the rib of a corpse, you take gray wool stolen from the sheep from a widow and

398
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,760
 you wrap it up and then you stuff it in between the boobs.

399
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,720
 So you just stick it in there and squeeze them shut, squeeze those boobies tight.

400
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,680
 And that's just part one of the spell.

401
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,520
 Then every Sunday for three Sundays that woman has to go to church.

402
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 She's like, "This wasn't part of the deal.

403
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,480
 I thought I'd have Sunday mornings off."

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
 No.

405
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
 She has to go to church, Catholic church, and when they give her the communion wafer she

406
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,520
 goes yum yum yum and then she looks from side to side and then she spits the communion

407
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:27,480
 wafer into her cleavage and this bone wrapped in wool is going to start eating the spit

408
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
 out communion wafer.

409
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,560
 She has to do that three Sundays in a row and then after the third time you fed this

410
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:40,520
 thing the spit out communion wafer, it bites her on the thigh and now you have a till

411
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 berry.

412
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,640
 Again, this entire thing is to drink.

413
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,480
 This entire thing is to get drinks.

414
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:54,640
 You now have a two headed snake that steals goat milk.

415
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:04,200
 It will slither around until it finds a goat, attach itself to its nipples, and won't drink

416
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
 up fresh goat milk.

417
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,920
 I mean, I guess that's a good thing.

418
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,760
 But it drinks up the goat milk and then comes back to your house and vomits it up in a bucket.

419
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,880
 And there you go.

420
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,800
 You now have fresh goat milk to drink.

421
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:27,560
 All it took was about a month and several felonies and now you have unlimited goat milk.

422
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,840
 You can make all the goat cheese you want, but I probably wouldn't eat it because it

423
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,400
 does involve snake vomiting.

424
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,000
 But you can sell it and just leave that part out of the brochure.

425
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,600
 But you could say it's organic.

426
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
 So we have stuff like the till berry, but that's not the main reason why we're in Iceland.

427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,600
 That's not the main reason why Jonah has been wearing the necropants now for two episodes.

428
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,880
 I want to talk about another artifact called the necropants.

429
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,640
 And there are some historians who say these have never been made.

430
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,920
 This is just fables because apparently you had like the pagan religion in Iceland and

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,760
 then around the 1700s, maybe a little bit earlier, but in this time period, you had Christian

432
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,080
 missionaries come out there and they're like, we're here to teach the way of the Lord.

433
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,040
 I hope you guys like communion wafers and people are like, well, we got other plans for those.

434
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,320
 And it was interesting in Iceland, they had their version of their witch trials.

435
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,440
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure they did show up earlier in the 1700s, but in the 1700s, we had the

436
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,160
 Icelandic witch trials.

437
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 But unlike the witch trials of America, the witch trials in Iceland were predominantly

438
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:46,560
 men who were being accused and castigated and executed for witchcraft.

439
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,000
 Because you had all these old pagan religions and now you had Christianity come in, we get

440
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,920
 these stories coming out of those two culture clashes.

441
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,960
 The historians go, we don't know if a pair of necropants have ever been made, but there

442
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,600
 are definitely stories about them.

443
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,480
 There's a replica of necropants at a museum in the area.

444
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,640
 I have to say, saying the necropants don't exist is exactly what I would expect.

445
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
 Exactly what I would expect someone who wears necropants to say.

446
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,040
 So maybe the people are trying to suppress the truth because if this is a true relic,

447
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,040
 this is incredibly powerful.

448
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:31,880
 Locally they're known as the Nabrock, which translates into necropants or another term

449
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,360
 that's used as corpse britches.

450
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,560
 It just doesn't sound as cool.

451
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,760
 Necropants, here's how we make a pair of necropants.

452
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,240
 And these are worth it.

453
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,160
 If I want to go get goat milk, I'll go, I will go and suck off the teat of a goat myself.

454
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,480
 I don't need a two-headed snake to do it.

455
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,400
 It's not worth it to make it till berry for me, but necropants, I mean these things are

456
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
 incredibly powerful.

457
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,040
 What happens is first off, you have to get permission from a living man.

458
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,520
 You have to ask him, "Hey, I've noticed that you're not going to live forever.

459
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
 You're not immortal.

460
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
 You're not Superman.

461
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,240
 I've noticed you're going to die at some point."

462
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,920
 I was wondering if when you die, if I can have your skin.

463
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
 And you're like, "Okay, okay, don't freak out just yet.

464
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 Let me be more specific.

465
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,120
 I'm not, I don't want your face.

466
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
 That's a maniac.

467
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
 Only a maniac.

468
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,400
 Only a maniac would want all of your skin.

469
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,560
 I just want the skin from your waist down.

470
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,200
 I'll put it to good use."

471
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,600
 And so if the guy agrees, then you just wait for him to die.

472
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,080
 Just sitting there, you're feeding him cheeseburgers all day long.

473
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
 You're like, "Look what I just invented.

474
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
 It's 1700s Iceland.

475
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,120
 I invented the cheeseburger.

476
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,440
 Goat cheeseburger."

477
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,600
 You feed him cheeseburgers until he dies or he just dies of an actual death.

478
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,440
 And what you have to do is you have to wait until he's buried.

479
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
 Then you sneak into the graveyard.

480
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
 As you're doing this, you see your neighbor.

481
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,080
 You see your neighbor breaking a rib bone off something.

482
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,120
 You're like, "I wonder where all my goat milk was going."

483
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
 You go to the graveyard.

484
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,120
 You dig up this dude's grave that you've made this arrangement with.

485
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
 You get his corpse.

486
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:25,080
 Now what you have to do is you have to flay his skin in one piece.

487
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,320
 You would have to be an artiste to do this.

488
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:33,620
 You'd have to be like a long time leather worker butchered sadistic madman.

489
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:40,200
 You have to, from the waist down, you have to flay all of his skin off in one piece.

490
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,280
 You can't accidentally rip it.

491
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,560
 You can't stitch it together.

492
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
 It won't work.

493
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:51,520
 You basically have to make, if you imagine if someone peeled the skin off of you from,

494
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,000
 I don't know if you need the feet.

495
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
 Maybe because that would be super hard.

496
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,680
 You're like, "Oh man, I always ripped the ninth toe."

497
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
 "Oh man."

498
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,840
 You just throw the flayed skin down on the ground.

499
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,800
 You go back and you're like, "I'll try again."

500
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 I don't know if you need the feet.

501
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,440
 I think the picture didn't show the feet, the necropants.

502
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,040
 So imagine a pair of pants but it's human flesh.

503
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,760
 That is what this is but it's not stitched together.

504
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,800
 You have to flay it down in one piece.

505
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,440
 You may not need to do the toes or the feet but you do need to do the testicles.

506
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,920
 You need to make sure that you get all of the good stuff going on down there.

507
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,400
 You gotta pull it off in one piece.

508
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:39,920
 Now you have a pair of necropants but they're not fully powered yet.

509
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,080
 You just have this stinky gross thing and your wife's like, "Uh, honey, you're doing

510
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
 something with that, right?"

511
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,720
 I noticed in the workshop you have that pair of pants, that flayed human skin.

512
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
 You're gonna finish that project right?

513
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, on the weekend.

514
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,800
 You have this, now you have to power it.

515
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:08,320
 The way that you do is that you have to go and find a poor widow, final woman who's already

516
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,640
 lost her husband, she doesn't have any money to pay rent, her goats are all of a sudden

517
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
 not producing any milk.

518
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,280
 You have to steal a coin from her and then there's a sigil you write on like a little

519
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,920
 piece of paper.

520
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:31,120
 So you have a widow's coin, you have a sigil on a piece of paper, you tuck those into the

521
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,000
 scrotum, into your friend's scrotum and now put the pants on.

522
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,520
 I guess I probably should have told you earlier, you're making a pair right now, you're like,

523
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,720
 "Whew, okay, what's the next detail Jason, I can't wait."

524
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,640
 Make sure you can fit into your friend's skin.

525
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,200
 Don't pick the twink, don't pick the dude who has super thin legs.

526
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,720
 Pick like a big beefy guy.

527
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,920
 That's what I would suggest.

528
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,720
 You got hammer pants on, you're like, "Oh, oh, oh, you're got the necker pants."

529
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,240
 You have like, you want, because here's the thing, you have to wear these for the rest

530
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
 of your life.

531
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,480
 I probably should have included that detail, you just put them on, you're like, "Okay,

532
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
 what?

533
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
 Jason, what she tells all the details at the beginning?"

534
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,640
 My argument would be, why are you following step by step instructions and not listening

535
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,080
 to the entire thing yet?

536
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,480
 Trying to hold back my cough, I still have that COVID cough.

537
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,840
 To be fair, we're both in the wrong, but you have to put these pants on, you have to be

538
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,200
 able to fit into them.

539
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,720
 I think that was kind of implied.

540
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,680
 You have to be able to fit into these pants, you're like, "God, I'm from like some guy

541
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
 who's like three feet tall."

542
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,720
 You're like, "He's my best friend and he said I can use the skin."

543
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 What?

544
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,720
 Oh man, you put them on a dog, you put them on a chucky dog.

545
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,680
 You have to be able to fit into these pants and you can never take them off.

546
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,680
 So it should be a comfortable fit.

547
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,120
 But you also got this coin in your scrotum all the time.

548
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,040
 Not in your scrotum, it's in your best friend's scrotum, but his scrotum is now technically

549
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
 your scrotum.

550
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,640
 They're rubbing against each other.

551
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,160
 What is the point of the Necropants, Jason?

552
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
 You're like, "What?

553
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,720
 Why am I wearing the skin of my dead friend?

554
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,160
 Why did I rob that widow?

555
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,240
 Why have I done any of this?"

556
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,680
 From now until the day you remove the pants, you can remove the pants.

557
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,760
 You're actually supposed to remove the pants at some point, but you'll become so addicted

558
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,720
 to them you won't want to wear them, but you got to take them off before you die.

559
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,320
 So hopefully you don't die suddenly.

560
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:40,400
 From now, as long as you're wearing the Necropants, whenever you want money, you can reach into

561
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,840
 your best friend's scrotum and pull out coins.

562
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,240
 You're pulling out pennies.

563
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
 You're like, "Ahh!"

564
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,960
 You're like, "Go to the cat, you go to Walmart," and you're like, "Oh, man, 99 cents."

565
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,520
 You're like, "One, two."

566
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
 You keep reaching in.

567
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,520
 I don't know if the currency is dependent on the coin you originally put in.

568
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,040
 I don't know if you just get gold coins each time, but what you do is you have to reach

569
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:10,400
 in to the Necropants, and as long as you don't remove the original coin, you'll have an unlimited

570
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,280
 source of money coming out of your balls.

571
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,120
 Because technically, they're yours at this point as well.

572
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,720
 They're just like snug in there.

573
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,960
 You constantly got to be pulling money out.

574
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,240
 And again, I don't think you will.

575
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,880
 I imagine you don't pull the money out in public.

576
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,080
 I don't imagine you go to pay your taxes and you're at the IRS office and you're like,

577
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,080
 "Here you go," and you just keep reaching in to your pants.

578
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,240
 Even in the 1700s, they did have perverts.

579
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,320
 I'm sure they would have beat you to death.

580
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:44,240
 I would imagine you would go, "Hey, I'm going to need $500 to pay off this bill," and you

581
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,560
 just reaching in to your scrotum at home and pull the money out.

582
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,720
 And your wife's like, "Okay, okay.

583
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,880
 You've been paying off a lot of bills, quote, unquote lately.

584
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,000
 Quit touching yourself."

585
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 You pull money, an unlimited amount of money out of the ballsack of your best friend's

586
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,160
 splayed skin.

587
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
 You're good to go.

588
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
 You're good to go.

589
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,760
 Now, like I said, I said you do have to keep them on forever.

590
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,120
 How could you get rid of them?

591
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,840
 You are now the wealthiest man in the village.

592
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,400
 Really you're the wealthiest man in the world.

593
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:24,040
 And that's why I think that these things, if the currency rate is fine, if you reached

594
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,240
 in and you pulled out seven pints, then obviously that's a joke.

595
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,840
 Obviously you did all this for nothing.

596
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,600
 But the point is, is that you would have unlimited currency.

597
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,640
 So let's say each time you pull it, you reach in and you pull out a solid gold coin.

598
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
 That'd be worth it, right?

599
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,160
 You have a piece of solid gold.

600
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,800
 You can exchange it for cash.

601
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,920
 And then you're like, put the cash into your butt crack.

602
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,800
 You're like, that's not part of the spell.

603
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,160
 It's just very comfortable.

604
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,360
 But at some point before you die, and hopefully you don't die suddenly, you have to get rid

605
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,680
 of these pants because it's a cursed item.

606
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,520
 Even though you got permission, you're still walking around in human skin.

607
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,200
 Whether or not it was consensual, you're walking around in dead man's skin.

608
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,680
 You have to get rid of these things.

609
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,640
 If you don't get rid of them before you die, you're damned to hell.

610
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,440
 What people will do is pass these on to their children.

611
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:29,040
 If you thought your parents were bad, at least they never gave you human skin.

612
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,800
 You pass it on your children and we can dissect this legend in a second.

613
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
 We're running out of time.

614
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,400
 I do want to go a little bit into that, but you pass it on your children so you're passing

615
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,040
 on that ability to remain successful and wealthy.

616
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,640
 But it's not as easy as taking them off and then little Billy opens up a present and he's

617
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,600
 like, whoa, Necro pants, Necro pants for Christmas.

618
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,960
 Yay, it's what I've always wanted.

619
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,080
 It's not that easy.

620
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,320
 Of course it's not that easy.

621
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:02,320
 What you have to do is you can only take them off one leg at a time, which is how you normally

622
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
 take off pants.

623
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
 But remember this is human skin.

624
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,360
 You probably had them for 30 years now.

625
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,480
 It's probably dried out.

626
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,080
 It's probably tough like leather.

627
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,880
 But I would get out of one leg and then the person I'm giving them to has to get in that,

628
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,360
 put their leg in that empty sleeve, that empty leg.

629
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 That's incredibly hard.

630
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
 I want you guys to try that.

631
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,600
 I don't want you guys to get a pair of slacks or jeans or whatever and try to take them off

632
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,280
 and you step out of one leg and then someone else steps into that leg.

633
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,840
 And then you get out of the other leg and the other person steps in that leg.

634
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,360
 You can't ever fully take them off until someone else is putting them on.

635
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,440
 If you do, this person now has a pair of Necro pants they can reach into the ball sack and

636
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
 pull out money.

637
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,600
 It doesn't say what happens if you can't do this.

638
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
 Because it seems actually quite difficult.

639
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
 If I stepped out of pants with my right leg, someone else has to put their right leg in

640
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
 there.

641
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
 They can't have them backwards.

642
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,200
 They can't have the scrotum on their butt.

643
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
 First off, it would be hard to get money.

644
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,760
 Secondly, it wouldn't be too fun to sit down.

645
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,080
 But anyways, I assume that if you mess this up, one, the Necro pants stop working and

646
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,320
 two, you are now damp to hell because you don't have.

647
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,120
 You weren't able to give them to somebody else.

648
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,120
 It doesn't specifically say that, but that's what I would assume.

649
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,480
 That's what I would assume the rules of corpse britches are.

650
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,320
 So the Necro pants will now serve a new master, your child.

651
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,960
 And they will go on to ensure riches for the next generation.

652
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,360
 And then they would pass those down to their children and so on and so forth.

653
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,760
 It's fascinating artifact.

654
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
 We have to look at it in two ways.

655
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,760
 One, I think it's an interesting legend.

656
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,160
 And what I find very interesting, I don't want to go too much on this.

657
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,720
 I'm going to try to give myself like 45 seconds or a minute.

658
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,120
 But what I find so interesting is how much people in general, we see this all over the

659
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,320
 world don't trust rich people.

660
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,200
 Like whether it's Adrenochrome, whether it's you to be famous, you have to be a Satan

661
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,880
 worshipper in Hollywood.

662
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,920
 We have those modern day ones and then we have old timey ones like deals with the devil.

663
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,120
 Those have been around for hundreds of years.

664
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,880
 The reason why they're so successful is they sold their soul.

665
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,840
 It's so interesting because humans both want to be successful for themselves and for their

666
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,200
 children.

667
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,520
 And yet also look down on people who reach a certain level of success.

668
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,800
 I don't think anyone who works at the auto shop is like, "Oh, you know, Buster, he's

669
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
 not a great boss.

670
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
 I'm pretty sure he sold his soul to the devil.

671
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,040
 He runs this shop all crazy."

672
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
 It's weird.

673
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,600
 Yeah, I just find that so interesting how every society seems to distrust the wealthy.

674
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,840
 And some of that may be deserved, right?

675
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,160
 Sometimes we look at that and go, "Well, it's just interesting."

676
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,520
 I find it super interesting.

677
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,280
 You can even go back to the Bible and they go, "It's easier for the camel to fit through

678
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,040
 the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to get into heaven."

679
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,160
 I mean, Jesus said that.

680
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,080
 He was kind of the go-to guy.

681
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,160
 So yeah, it's super interesting.

682
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,080
 You can even go that far back and people don't trust the rich.

683
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,360
 And so if you lived in Iceland and your crops weren't doing that good, your goats weren't

684
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,960
 producing milk, you would assume someone had cast a spell on them.

685
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,080
 That is old world magic.

686
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,720
 It's super interesting.

687
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,960
 The thing about it on a psychological thing like that, but then also we'll wrap it up

688
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,920
 like this.

689
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,360
 What if they're real?

690
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
 What if they're real?

691
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:44,320
 This would be such a potent item to have.

692
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,480
 You would have unlimited riches.

693
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,600
 Every time you wanted money, again, let's say you're pulling out like a solid gold coin.

694
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:58,880
 Each time you reach into your scrotum, you're pulling out the equivalent of $1,200, $2,000.

695
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,000
 Investing it, maybe just blowing it out of a casino, you're like, "I don't care.

696
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,360
 I can lose all the money in the world.

697
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,840
 My balls are full of it."

698
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,520
 You know, I shouldn't say that out loud, people are like, "Security, can you get rid of this

699
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,200
 guy and check his balls as he's leaving?"

700
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,120
 You might find a tip for me.

701
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,960
 The idea that if these worked, and this would be a thing, right?

702
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,040
 If someone would go and know they don't work, they've never actually been made.

703
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,320
 Here's a replica of what they look like, but they don't work.

704
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,800
 I could see, if you go to Davos, you go to one of these world, or all these "elite"

705
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
 these world leaders.

706
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,520
 I don't even think most of them are world leaders.

707
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,560
 Businessmen go to these groups and they sit around and they talk about the next year of

708
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,000
 how the world's supposed to be going and the economy and the social issues and stuff

709
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 like that.

710
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,720
 I used to say two or three of them aren't wearing their best friend's skin.

711
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 And really it wouldn't even be that.

712
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,680
 It would be something that their father or their grandfather, or maybe even farther back,

713
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:06,240
 that they did when they passed these necro pants down the family line.

714
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,160
 Because it would be a secret you would want to keep, because otherwise, graveyard would

715
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,680
 be the busiest place.

716
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,280
 All of a sudden people, grave diggers are like, "Oh man, it's Saturday.

717
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,840
 This is when all the weirdos come out to dig up their friends' legs.

718
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,320
 I'm going to have to work overtime that day."

719
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
 Everyone would want a pair.

720
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,880
 It would collapse the world economy.

721
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,360
 Okay, maybe that's taken it too far.

722
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,920
 Maybe not everyone would want a pair, but again, if you had a pair of these, you wouldn't

723
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,680
 want to get rid of them.

724
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,320
 So that's the story of the necro pants.

725
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 A powerful artifact, if they're real, might be one of the most powerful magical artifacts

726
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,960
 out there, unlimited wealth.

727
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,240
 But it has a downside.

728
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,720
 It has a downside.

729
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,320
 You're wearing the skin of your best friend.

730
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,080
 That's definitely goes in the con category.

731
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,440
 There's not a pro there.

732
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,800
 You also imagine you'd have to be super careful.

733
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,040
 Like, "No tackle football for you.

734
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,760
 Go on, no tackle football for you.

735
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,280
 Good sir, you're out there, you're running around, you got the ball."

736
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,840
 Then all of a sudden someone grabs you and they rip your pants apart.

737
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,680
 Now normally, you would just be embarrassed.

738
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,560
 You and your buddies would have a good laugh as you're standing there and tattered jeans.

739
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,880
 Apparently you're playing tackle football with a Hulk.

740
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,560
 You can rip your jeans off.

741
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,120
 And then you just walk around in your boxer shorts for the rest of the day.

742
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,760
 It's a funny story to tell.

743
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,960
 But if you're wearing a pair of necro pants, I imagine you have to be very careful not

744
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,400
 to rip them, not to destroy them.

745
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,040
 Otherwise, you'd be cursed to hell.

746
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
 So no tackle football for you.

747
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 No twister.

748
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
 No games of twister.

749
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,520
 Those are the only things I can think of that'll ruin your pairs of pants.

750
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,520
 No Taco Bell.

751
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,680
 You're stuck in these poopy pants around my dead man's thighs.

752
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,680
 All sorts of things.

753
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
 Technically just three of them.

754
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
 But I would imagine...

755
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
 I mean, it's a cursed item.

756
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,240
 It actually technically doesn't say if you poop in them, you'll go to hell.

757
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,680
 It doesn't even say if you rip them, you'll go to hell.

758
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,560
 But let's just imagine.

759
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,960
 Let's put on our conspiracy cap made of our best friend's skull.

760
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,440
 Let's put it on.

761
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,040
 It's an interesting magical artifact.

762
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 They're super powerful.

763
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
 And here's the thing.

764
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,120
 You may go, "Well, yeah, it is interesting, Jason."

765
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,600
 But I would never make them myself.

766
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,640
 I would never go and dig on too lazy to get unlimited wealth.

767
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,360
 You're like, "I have to dig up a body.

768
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,920
 Never mind, I'll just work."

769
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,080
 You may choose not to make them yourselves, but what if your best friend or a loved one

770
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,440
 or someone you've looked up to all your life comes to you and says, "Hey, I'm in a bit

771
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,880
 of a pickle.

772
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,080
 I'm wearing skin of another man."

773
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,360
 That's quite the way to start a conversation.

774
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
 And here's the thing.

775
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,800
 If I don't take these off before I die, and I haven't told you, but I'm not feeling that

776
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,920
 good, I mean, it's probably a little more than I'm feeling good.

777
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,720
 I'm gonna die any day now.

778
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,720
 And you take these pants off.

779
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:04,080
 And if these pants are on me when I die, then I go to hell.

780
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,320
 This is quite the conversation to drop in the middle of dinner.

781
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,480
 Will you wear my Necro pants?

782
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,360
 And on the plus side, you know, you're unlimited wealth, but on the other side you're wearing

783
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,560
 this cursed object.

784
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,200
 Whether or not it's made of a dead man's skin, I mean, that is the main ingredient, but you'd

785
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,760
 be wearing an object that if any moment, if you died wearing these things, you're cursed

786
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
 to hell.

787
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,040
 So would you, really, what I'm getting into is would you help your buddy out?

788
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,120
 Would you slide into one leg of these Necro pants as he's taking them off and then jump

789
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,960
 into the other one?

790
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,440
 And now you're the owner of a cursed object.

791
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,680
 Yes, an object that will give you untold riches, but also one that you will someday also have

792
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,760
 to ask somebody, "Hey, do you want these pants?"

793
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,040
 You can't just throw them off the goodwill.

794
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,840
 You gotta get somebody to put them on.

795
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,360
 It's a fascinating dilemma.

796
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,560
 Would you wear the Necro pants?

797
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,400
 You may not make them yourselves, but would you help out someone you cared about if they

798
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,040
 told you?

799
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
 Please help.

800
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,120
 I need to find someone to wear these pants before I die.

801
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,920
 You have this conversation in a speeding train.

802
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
 It's about to go off into a canyon.

803
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,960
 He's like, "Ow, that's changed.

804
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
 They'll make you immortal."

805
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
 And they're like, "Oh, why do you want to take them off?"

806
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,400
 And I'm just really trying to get out of him.

807
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
 He's wrestling you.

808
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
 He's sliding your leg in.

809
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,000
 I don't know if the rules say you can't force someone into the Necro pants.

810
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,480
 But who's to say you may help a buddy out put on the Necro pants and then you're like,

811
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,640
 "Wow, I wonder what these do?"

812
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,600
 And you get hit by a car.

813
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,520
 And now you've gone to hell.

814
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,080
 You didn't even get a chance to reach into the scrotum to pull out unlimited riches.

815
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,720
 You didn't even get a chance to reach into your scrotum and pull out a couple coins.

816
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,920
 You just died right away and now you're in hell.

817
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,000
 So would you want that very, very specific set of circumstances?

818
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,560
 Or even not if someone came to you and said, "I have this cursed item.

819
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,360
 I need to get rid of it before I died."

820
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,860
 Would you help somebody out?

821
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,240
 Would you be willing to bring that curse upon yourself?

822
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
 Sure.

823
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:19,840
 In this case, you'd become incredibly wealthy, but in the end you also now have a cursed

824
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:27,880
 item, a pair of Necro pants, that you better find someone who's willing to wear them for

825
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,680
 you.

826
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,240
 Otherwise, even though you didn't make them, even though it wasn't your idea to dig up

827
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,000
 a corpse and follow all these instructions and to get the sigil and the coin, and even

828
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,280
 if you didn't fully benefit from the riches that the Necro pants could provide, these

829
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,000
 may have been passed down along a family line and he didn't have any kids and you're just

830
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,960
 a good drinking buddy on the weekend.

831
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,600
 Now you're in possession of this cursed object.

832
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,340
 Whether or not you had anything to do with the creation of it, you are now cursed yourself.

833
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,960
 Would you be willing to do that?

834
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,120
 That's such an interesting dilemma with an item like the Necro pants.

835
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:33,920
 They're almost too dangerous to have, but too powerful to turn down.

836
00:46:33,920 --> 00:47:03,760
 I'm not sure.

837
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,600
 I'm not sure.

838
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,600
 I'm not sure.
