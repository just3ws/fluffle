1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A murderer is accidentally transferred to the wrong cell unit.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And then the expected happens.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story that's currently going viral in Latin America.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Is it possible that two young kids saw something so insane their brains immediately broke today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I really do. I really mean that.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 This show is nice for me to do during this time because you know everyone's just kind of locked up.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Yes, I probably could play Minecraft 8 hours a day or State of Decay 2 or any of these other games that I have.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But it's nice to have something to do, a function.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I think humans require work. I think it's kind of built into who we are.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And yeah, yeah, so I'm really glad that you guys are listening to this show.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I hope I can be part of your day, cheer you up a little bit for 30 minutes, 45 minutes. The episodes have gotten longer recently.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I want to give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Ash Black.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Thank you so much for supporting the Patreon. He's actually the artist behind the Dead Rabbit logo, the red and black iconic Dead Rabbit logo.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 He came up with that one night listening to the podcast on 4chan. I had an earlier logo and that's the one he made.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And I would consider him one of the earliest supporters, Patreon or not, of Dead Rabbit Radio. I really, really appreciate it.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That's smart guy. He's had a lot of really cool projects. Really, really cool guy.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I'll see what he's up to now and see if there's anything I can plug for him.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Also, if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. I totally understand financial reasons.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Or you live in a country that has a new PayPal or you don't like PayPal, you don't like stuff that they've done in the past. Totally understand that.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 You can support the show simply by getting the word out about the show. That helps a lot as well.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Just talk to people about the show, recommend it, and that means a lot as well.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Also, I don't do this often, but I made a movie suggestion yesterday for Dead Rabbit's Movie Club.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Friday night, 7pm, we're going to do a live stream on YouTube. Talk about movies.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I apologize for the movie I picked last night. I had never seen it before.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Sorority Babes and the Slimeball Bolarama. We will discuss it. We will discuss it.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I'm just going to double down. I'm going to double down because last night's movie was bad if you didn't watch it.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Last week, we had a lot of good movies. This week, Housewife was really good. Slimeball Bolarama was not very good.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I'm going to double down. I'm going to go with Tonight's Selection. This is on Shutter.com. You can find it other places.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Shutter.com currently has a promo code SHUTIN. SHUTIN, you get 30 days for free on Shutter.com. I'm not sponsored by them in any sort of way.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I'm just using the service myself. The Baby. It's a 1970s horror movie. I've never seen it.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Again, I'm shooting blind here. I've never seen it. It's about a woman who gets hired to take care of an adult baby.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's all I know about it. The description on Shutter.com, they say it's really insane even by 1970 standards.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Let's do it. The Baby. Let's watch The Baby tonight. It's a classic 70s horror movie. I've never seen it.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 The cover is just a woman going, "Oh!" and then a giant feet sitting out of a baby crib. I really don't know what to expect, honestly.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We'll watch that. I'll try to figure out some possibly good ones we can watch later in the week.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We know what we're going to watch for Friday. That's a surprise. But anyways, let's get started with the episode here.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So Ash Black, we're actually not using a vehicle this first story. This first story, we're under arrest.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Getting our hands cuffed. Bam! On the cop car. I didn't do nothing, Officer. What are you doing, man?

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I didn't do anything, Officer. Those jewels, they were with me when I found them.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And that jewelry store, that glass was broken. It's coincidence, man. Synchronicity.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So we get dragged downtown. We get processed. Fingerprinted. Mug shots. Turn to the left. Doing all that stuff, right?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I've seen a lot of shows. I always thought, "Oh, I could totally do jail, right? Like, if I was thrown in jail, keep to myself.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I could totally... I've been here, locked in here, my apartment, the luxury of my apartment for 30 days.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I'm crawling out of my skin. These wounds, they will not heal. I cannot imagine what I would be doing in jail.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Maybe in jail, there's more of a social aspect. Unless you're in solitary. But I always figured out, man, if someone threw me in jail for like three years, six years, whatever, I could do that.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Depending on the jail. California jails, not so much. Oregon jails, I could probably get away with that.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 But anyways, I'm not planning on going to jail or prison. But as I'm saying that rant right in front of a correctional officer, and he's like shaking his head, he's like, "You're not going to survive in prison, boy."

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I'm like, "Ah, we both get thrown into general population." And that is where we meet Jonathan Watson. We're at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Cork and California.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Now, you like how they have the first, the nice part of the beginning. "Oh, I'm going to the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility? That's not too bad."

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 But then, the second part of that is State Prison. State Prison in Cork and California. This story took place on January 16th, 2020.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And while we're walking around General Pop, we meet Jonathan Watson. He's 41 years old. Now, we are all, like, we robbed a jewelry store, right?

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So that's kind of a cool crime. Nothing to be ashamed about. You should be ashamed that you got caught, but you know, stealing jewels, that's kind of cool.

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's something like the Beagle Boys do. So that's like a cartoon crime, basically. So we're walking around and we see Jonathan Watson coming.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Now, he's not supposed to be here, because where we're at is kind of low, not super low level offenders. We're on level two.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So you have level one, which is drunks and stuff like that. Really, really, that would basically be your white-collar criminals.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Level two, thieves, junkies, stuff like that. And worse, we'll get to that in a second. But level three is where you put murderers.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You keep them, they're violent offenders. You keep them away from everyone else.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Jonathan Watson's supposed to be in level three, because he's a violent murderer. And he has life in prison.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But there is a little, someone, someone was on their computer and they're like playing mahjong in between, typing in, sentencing guidelines, and they accidentally shifted him.

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It was a snafu. Everyone admits this was a snafu. They shifted him from level three to level two.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So one day Jonathan's sitting on his cot and ahhh, the gate opens up, and they're like, "Okay, get your stuff. We're going to level two."

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 What? I don't think so. What, you telling me what to do? I'm not on a fine fine, I'll go to level two. Like, I know it's much more cushy down there.

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 The whole time Jonathan's thinking, "This doesn't seem right." Like, I know me. I know me. I'm a murderer. I should be on level three.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But anyways, you know what you're going to do? He goes down to level two. He has a single man cell and then they open up into like this big kind of dorm room area.

67
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 One day he's sitting, he's not there for very long. And he's sitting in the common room. And this new inmate walks in. And everyone gets a little uneasy, because they know his sheet.

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 They know what he's in there for. "Agrivated a sexual assault of a child under the age of 14." Nobody likes this guy, right?

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Nobody wants to have anything to do with this guy. But everyone's a low level offender. So you're going to have child molesters and stuff like that.

70
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And a lot of times it'll be in protective custody, which is basically you're just locked in your cell the whole time. Or you'll be sent to a sexual assault prison, where it's just you and all your gross compadres,

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 which is a bad idea, because then they just kind of network. But this one, like, what's a jewel thief? We may be tempted to beat this dude up.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But really in reality, like, people who are in there, they're facing five years because they got caught with some drugs, or because they, you know, pushed over a vending machine and crushed someone's leg, something like that.

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 They're just going to do their time. They think the guy's disgusting, but what are you going to do, right? Because if they kill them, then they're looking to go into level three. They're going to be there for the rest of their life.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 So anyways, they don't know, though, and this new inmate doesn't know that Jonathan is not a low level offender.

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But Jonathan also is thinking, you know, I'm at level two. Let's see if I can make this work. This guy walks in. We don't know his name. We don't know this guy's name.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But he walks in, picks up the remote. There's television going on, watching whatever. Picks up the remote, changes the channel to PBS Kids.

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Sits down and starts watching kids' television. Everyone just kind of looks at each other like, what the fuck?

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Jonathan Watson, he did an interview after this. He has this quote about what happened that night.

79
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 He says, quote, "I could not sleep having not done what every instinct told me I should have done right there and then."

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So I packed all of my things because I knew one way or another the situation would be resolved the following day.

81
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Next day, Jonathan goes to his counselor and says, I'm going to kill this dude. I'm going to kill this guy.

82
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Counselor? Totally ignores him. Doesn't believe him. Which I'm sure they hear a lot, but again, this guy is in prison for murdering somebody.

83
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Counselor blows him up, doesn't believe him.

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Two hours after he talks to the counselor, he's sitting in the common room.

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 The molester dude walks back in, picks up the remote, turns it to PBS Kids.

86
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 At that point, somebody says, they're looking around and somebody actually says, is this guy really going to watch this in front of us?

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And Jonathan said, quote, "I got this."

88
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 He gets up, there's an inmate sitting around, he had a cane. He, you know, needs a cane. He's an old man.

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And so Jonathan gets up, walks over to the guy with the cane, grabs it, and proceeds to beat the man to death in front of everybody.

90
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Everyone's freaking out because even though it's prison, you don't often see people just get murdered while they're watching television.

91
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Yeah, that's what you see in Oz, and it does happen in certain prisons, but it's not, it doesn't happen all the time.

92
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You could go a good, you could go and do three, five years in prison and never see that level of violence.

93
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Again, this was lower security, right? This was not where all the murderers are supposed to be.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 This is where the jewel thieves are. So we're sitting there, still got some jewels hidden in our pockets, and we're super nervous,

95
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 as this dude is bashing this guy's head in with a cane. This dude's dead.

96
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Jonathan's kind of standing there. Everyone is like, whoa, whoa, like, you have mixed feelings because one, this guy was definitely flaunting his sickness.

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He definitely had some disgusting habits and sat down and was watching the show, making everyone else watch it.

98
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But on the other hand, you just watched a human get his brain smashed out, right?

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So everyone's like locking themselves in their own cell. Jonathan's standing there and he's waiting for the alarms to go up.

100
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 He's waiting for the guards to come rushing out. Nothing. Dead silence.

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Okay, I'll go turn myself in, because again, he knows he has a problem.

102
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Unlike the child molester. The child molester wasn't told. It's not like the killer was sitting down and watching Saw 4,

103
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 but the child molester was watching PBS Kids. So he goes, that's done. I should have done it last night, but I didn't.

104
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I'm going to go turn myself in. And he's walking to where he knows the guards at.

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And as he's walking, he sees this other prisoner coming, who he describes as a "knowing child trafficker."

106
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And he thinks to himself, quote, this was his quote, "In for a penny, in for a pound, and murders him with the same cane."

107
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Beats him to death, right there. And then he walks to the guard and goes, hey, just murdered, just murdered two people.

108
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Both child molesters. You really should put me back on level three. Guard doesn't believe him.

109
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 He's like, no, no, I'm not joking with you. Like, I shouldn't have been down here in the first place.

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I'm glad I am because they're both disgusting, but they're both dead. And so you should give me to level three.

111
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And the guard was like, oh, come on, Jonathan, I know you're just joking. And then the guard slightly turns the corner and sees one body there.

112
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Locked down. And they did. They ended up having to shut everything down and get him back up to level three.

113
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And he said, and he does, he's totally fine. He's back in there. He's already serving life in prison.

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 He really didn't see a problem with it. And the article ended with this quote, this was an interview he did with the newspaper.

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 The article ended with this quote, "Being a lifer, I'm in a unique position where I sometimes have access to these people and I have so little to lose.

116
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And trust me, we get it. These people are every parent's worst nightmare."

117
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So a simple tale of vigilante justice. I'm sure that Jonathan thinks that in the end, in the cosmic end, that wasn't an error that moved him from level three to level two.

118
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 That those two people needed to be taken off the plane board. And that little clerical error that moved him down one floor allowed him to purge the planet of people who--

119
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I mean, that's pretty gross, the fact that you're engaging that activity and then you go to prison and then you're mocking the other prisoners.

120
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 They know what you're in there. You know what I mean? That makes it-- That's a guy who's an actual disgusting human being.

121
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And then anyone who traffics children as well. Come on, that's gross. The whole thing's gross.

122
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So Jonathan, you have your-- I don't think they let him keep the cane, but if they did, I'm actually 100% positive they didn't let him keep the cane.

123
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They're like, "Oh, you can keep that murderer up." And I'm sure that he looks back on it and believes that he was meant to do that.

124
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And to save those parents some future grief if those guys ever got out. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Now, our next story is really bizarre. So Ash Blackfire at that carbonic copter, we're going to bribe the guards with our jewels, we're going to fly out of this prison, and we're flying off to Mexico.

126
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Now, this next story was a recommendation from a listener known as Thomas. Thank you so much, Thomas, for sending me the story.

127
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 He sent it to me via email, and he said, "This is a creepypasta that's really going viral in Latin America right now."

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Let's take a look at this one. This is a weird one. Let's take a look at this.

129
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Three years ago, somewhere in Mexico. Now, generally when stuff is that vague, it makes us suspicious, but let's just keep going here.

130
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 We don't have any names either, which also makes everything very vague, almost like an urban legend.

131
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So let's call the main character Thomas. Let's call the main character Thomas.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Thomas and his two cousins, one older and one younger, are going to a soccer game with Thomas' uncle.

133
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They drive out. They have a good time watching the soccer game. Yay! The game lasted three hours, and there was two goals made.

134
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It was a tie! Woo! Yeah, yeah! Woo! Best sport ever! Yeah! And as everyone when they're driving back and they're realizing that sport is lame, they get back to the uncle's house.

135
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Now, Thomas is sitting in the car, and his older cousin and his younger cousin. Let's call them...

136
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 The younger one will call them Billy, and the older one will call Jake. I know there's really traditional Hispanic names, right?

137
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Billy's the little one, and Jake's the older one. Billy and Jake run inside their house. Thomas is sitting in the car, and his uncle and his father are just out talking.

138
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 "Hey man, did you see the game? Yeah, I was really born. I mean, super exciting. I'm totally in a soccer."

139
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 "Yeah, me too." The uncle shifts his eyes from side to side.

140
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And then they hear a horrible screaming coming from inside the house.

141
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Something not like I saw a spider screaming, but a screaming on the level of "I'm being flayed alive."

142
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 A torturous scream. A scream that comes from inside your belly.

143
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I think there's nothing scarier than the sound of a man screaming. Because I think through horror movies, and I think even just when girls get excited, they'll scream.

144
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 You get desensitized to the sound of a woman screaming. But if you've ever heard a man scream, it's terrifying.

145
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Like a man actually scream, it's gut-wrenching, because you never hear it. You never really hear it. Even in movies, it's very rare.

146
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 We've become desensitized. There's a term called "scream queen," because we're so used to women screaming in movies.

147
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And again, "Oh my god, oh my god!" And there's a girl gets excited, she'll scream.

148
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But when you hear a man scream, think about the times. Think about the times you've heard a man scream in real life.

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's always something that's really gone south. Not talking about a boy or a kid. I'm talking about a man.

150
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But these were boys. But that was just a side thing. So anyways, Jake and Billy are in the house and they're just screaming.

151
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Not out of excitement, almost not even out of fear, but out of pain.

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 The uncle, the dad, and Thomas run from the car, run inside the house.

153
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And they see Billy underneath the kitchen table, sobbing uncontrollably.

154
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But that's not the main source of the torturous cries.

155
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 They see Jake convulsing his body, tensing up, and making grotesque movements as a tortured look sits on his face.

156
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And horrible, deep screams are coming out of him. They think he's having a seizure, and little Billy's freaking out because of it.

157
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 The adults grab Jake, hold him down. Thomas is just standing there watching the whole thing.

158
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 They try to hold Jake down, they try to get his limbs to relax, but he's just contorting his body in fear.

159
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 They put a rag in his mouth, they think he's having a seizure, they think he's going to swallow his tongue, and muffles his yelling, but it's still there.

160
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And Billy's just sobbing, sobbing underneath the table.

161
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Everything else in the kitchen is normal. A normal kitchen, except for the two kids flipping out in it.

162
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They can't get Jake to stop convulsing.

163
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So they pick him up, they put him in a chair, and they tie him to the chair, which is kind of odd, right?

164
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Because you don't, I still at this point don't know if it's a medical emergency or not, but they're afraid he's going to injure himself.

165
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 His whole body is just having a fit. They tie him to the chair.

166
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 At the same time, they're still trying to figure out what's going on.

167
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now they ask Billy what's going on. Why is Jake acting like this? Why is Jake acting like this? And Billy is just sobbing, sobbing.

168
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now, as he's tied down, Jake is starting, his movements are restricted now, so he actually does seem to be calming down.

169
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Which must have an effect on Billy, because he's starting to able to say what happened.

170
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Billy tells this story. Billy says that him and Jake both walked into the house, talking about soccer, all of that stuff.

171
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 They walk into the kitchen, and their family dog is in the kitchen.

172
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 It's sitting on the kitchen chair. There's a bowl of cereal in front of the dog, on the kitchen table.

173
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 The dog has a spoon. He's holding it with his paw, and he scoops it into the cereal, takes a bite.

174
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 The two kids stand there for a second, stunned. The dog, holding the spoon, dips it back into the cereal, takes it to its mouth, takes a bite.

175
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 The adults are like, "Wait, what? That's it?" The dog was eating cereal with the spoon. Your dog was eating cereal with the spoon.

176
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 But before Billy can answer this, Jake begins to convulse again and begins screaming, even though his mouth is muffled. It's like he was seeing it all over again.

177
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So at this point, they call the ambulance, because now he's fully convulsed, even though he's tied down, they call the ambulance.

178
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 The ambulance comes out there, take him to the hospital. What they say is that he appears to have some sort of breakdown.

179
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Physically, he's fine. He's not having a heart attack, he's not having a seizure. But he must have seen something.

180
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 The adults at the hospital are like, "Well, I mean, Billy the youngest is saying that he saw a dog eating cereal with the spoon."

181
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Doctors are like, "Well, we're not going to say, we just know that this boy is having some sort of nervous breakdown.

182
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 We're going to treat him here, but if it doesn't get better, he's going to start needing therapy."

183
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And he does. Jake has to start going to therapy. Normally, a very healthy young man is now going to therapy.

184
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And the parents keep asking Billy, "What happened? What did you see?" And Billy goes, "We walked in and we saw our dog eating cereal with the spoon."

185
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And he just kept eating it. And then the next thing, I was crying and Jake was freaking out.

186
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 "Can you draw us a picture of what you saw?" "Yeah, I can." Billy sits down, draws a picture of the family dog with the spoon eating cereal.

187
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 After that night, the family dog was never seen again.

188
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And to this day, Jake is still going to see a therapist to try to get over what he saw in the kitchen that day.

189
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's an interesting story. What's interesting about it is, if I approached it like this, if I had said in my intro,

190
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 "Today on Dead Rabbit Radio, a man sees a dog eating cereal with the spoon and his mind."

191
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Depending on how the story is told, is how it affects you, I believe.

192
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Thomas said, "For whatever reason, Thomas goes, 'Listen, I'm a skeptic. I don't believe any of this stuff. I find it interesting. I love your show. Your show is awesome. Your show hands to me. I love you so much.'"

193
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Oh, thank you. Thank you. He didn't say that last stuff, but he meant to say that last stuff.

194
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He said, he goes, "I'm a skeptic about a lot of stuff, but for whatever reason, this story creeps me out."

195
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 It's funny because I read it. I read his version of it. He'd thankfully translated it for me and sent me a link where it's also being posted on Facebook.

196
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 The translation is a little rough there. So thank you, Thomas.

197
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Definitely when people send me stuff from other languages, it always helps to get a translation or your version of the story.

198
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 But as I read it, I read it a couple of times, it is something chilling about it. And I think it's chilling on a couple levels.

199
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 One, it's so mundane. We talk about Cthulhu and the Old Gods, people seeing things looking into the pit that drives them into madness.

200
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And that's fine on a literary level. H.P. Lovecraft can end the story with, and then he looked in the closet and all things were all...

201
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Oh, man, he went insane. He saw something so dark. Yeah, that's fine. And it's interesting.

202
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I'm not knocking the works of Lovecraft, but a dog eating cereal with a spoon would break your brain as well.

203
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Like, something that mundane to me is actually more terrifying.

204
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And again, it wasn't like the dog was moving it with his nose. The dog picked up a spoon, which is impossible, right?

205
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Right there, if you saw a dog holding a spoon. That's impossible.

206
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Without some sort of tape or some sort of gimmick or something like that.

207
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 A dog picking up a spoon and then putting it into the cereal and scooping it into their mouth and that would break your brain.

208
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Because you're seeing something that you know 100% isn't possible.

209
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Now, ghosts, you may not believe in ghosts, but we've been told since we were children that ghosts exist.

210
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 We have an entire holiday based around ghosts and goblins and ghouls and stuff like that.

211
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So if you woke up in the middle of the night and there was someone standing at the foot of your bed in a dark cloak with green glowing eyes,

212
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 you would go, "Oh my God, I saw a ghost!" or "I saw something!" or "I don't know what I saw. It was a trick of the light." Whatever.

213
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 But your brain can process that.

214
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Because you've been told that that is possible in somewhere or another.

215
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Or again, if you don't believe in it, you can be, you can, your brain will process it as it's a trick of the light.

216
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 But if you walked into your living room and it's broad daylight,

217
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 and you saw an armadillo smoking a pipe and putting a puzzle together,

218
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 no, you know what, even an armadillo is too exotic.

219
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 If you walked into your house, if you saw a dog smoking a pipe and doing a puzzle,

220
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 and then it just looked, it just looks at you and then goes back to putting the puzzle in the right pieces, it would break your brain.

221
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 It, what makes this story scary is it's the mundane aspect of it.

222
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It was their dog at their kitchen table, in their house.

223
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 The only thing that didn't make sense was the movements it was making and the instinct it had to lift the cereal to its mouth.

224
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It's an oddly disturbing story.

225
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It's an oddly disturbing story because it's so mundane.

226
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And I can see why it's catching fire. I can see why it's going viral.

227
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Because it's a well-told story.

228
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Even though we don't, I like, me, being me, I like to have names and places and stuff like that.

229
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So I can verify things.

230
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But that's not a necessity for everything, especially for campfire stories. It rarely is.

231
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 But, and I think that's what, this is more of like a viral creepypasta campfire story type of thing.

232
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But it's one of those stories that I don't necessarily think, I think that it could be true in this sense.

233
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Not that, there's a couple different things.

234
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 One, they could have walked in, the dog could have been eaten cereal.

235
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 But that's actually the least likely scenario, right?

236
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 You could have had a whole host of paranormal phenomena.

237
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 We're assuming the narrative's true, because again, most likely it's a creepypasta.

238
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Someone wrote a really cool short horror story in its catching fire.

239
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But let's assume that it's true for a second.

240
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Any host of paranormal phenomenon could have taken place.

241
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 We've talked about this before, where alien abductions will disguise themselves as roadwork.

242
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 So your car stops, and you're waiting for like, some signal that you can go.

243
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 There's just roadwork signs everywhere, and you're there for a couple minutes, and you turn around,

244
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 and then eight years later you get hypnotized, and you realize while you were there, alien showed up.

245
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 We've discussed stories like that before, so you could have any sort of paranormal phenomenon going on.

246
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And how their brain perceived it, their brain made sense of it the best way they could have.

247
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 They could have not walked in and seen a dog eating cereal.

248
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 They could have walked in and seen their dog being abducted by an alien.

249
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But their brains can't process that, so instead it creates an image of the dog eating cereal,

250
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 which is still a mind boggling, bizarre image. It's impossible.

251
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But see, it's funny because alien's abducting dogs.

252
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 That is possible, because we've seen that happen in movies.

253
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 We know what an alien looks like, we know what these things are.

254
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I've talked about this on shows before. Can you imagine something you could never imagine?

255
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 That's what this would be. And even then it was put in a way that a human could comprehend it.

256
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 We know what dogs are, we know what eating cereal is.

257
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They shouldn't be able to do it with a spoon, but our brain is combining those two things.

258
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It is creepy, and Thomas, thank you for the recommendation. It definitely is a creepy story.

259
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And it's creepy because it's plausible in one aspect.

260
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And it's so mundane. So mundane. Which I really, really enjoy about it.

261
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 If the story was they walked into their kitchen and they saw the ethereal portal and they saw horrors beyond horror

262
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 in the alternate realms when they opened their fridge, I'd be like, "Oh, that's kind of interesting."

263
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 But you would be expected to go insane if you saw the butthole of Cthulhu.

264
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Like, you would be shocked if someone didn't go insane.

265
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 But going insane because you saw the real-life equivalent of dog-playing poker, that's bizarre.

266
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 That's bizarre. It doesn't always have to be super extreme.

267
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And that's a lot of times where conspiracy theories and ghost stories and alien stories fail.

268
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 They try to go too broad, too dark, too deep.

269
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Sometimes it's the innocent things that creep us out.

270
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Creepy isn't bouncing around on your bed as there's a ghost underneath it lifting it up.

271
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Creepy is you being up late one night and you hear the creak of the floorboard above you.

272
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And you know there's no one up at this time of the night.

273
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Creepiness is the edge.

274
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Once your door gets kicked in, you're fight or flight at that point.

275
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 The game has been set and you can do something about it.

276
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 But when you're just hearing the footsteps walk up the porch and then utter silence for seconds, minutes,

277
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 but you're sure someone is standing outside your door, that is creepy.

278
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That's where the tension lies.

279
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 So the next time you're sitting at home and you hear something in another room,

280
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 maybe you should just stay where you're at.

281
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Maybe you should let that noise be.

282
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Maybe you should turn the TV up a little bit louder,

283
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 or just simply turn the page of the book you're reading.

284
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Because while that noise may be nothing,

285
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 that noise may be something.

286
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Something impossible.

287
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And unless you're willing to risk your sanity for the sake of your curiosity,

288
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 just leave the noise in the dark room alone.

289
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 You may be better off because of it.

290
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
