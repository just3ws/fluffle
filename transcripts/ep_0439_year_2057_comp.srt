1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Alex Jones comes out as a cannibal.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 There's a disease out there that's worse than the disease of vampirism.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we take a look at a bizarre conspiracy theory that's just starting to surface.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Is it possible that a series of reviews left on a Google review website

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 can actually lead us to a transmission from the year 2057, today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys had a great weekend, but still saying that.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 No time to talk. We got a lot of stuff to cover.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 First off, we're going to shout out to our newest Patreon, Alexandra Watts.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Alexandra, thank you so much for supporting the show. You will be our captain of our vehicles for today.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Really, really appreciate it. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Like I said, we got a lot of stuff to cover. Alexandra, you fire up that carbon helicopter.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 While you're doing that, pull on my laptop. While you're doing all the pre-engine check stuff, hands are all oily.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Do-do-do-do-do-do. Pulling up on my laptop. Let's take a look at this video here.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Recently, Alex Jones, Alex Jones to me is a character. I'm sure he's an actual biological human.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I'm not saying that he is a hologram, but I think the Alex Jones the human.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And Alex Jones at this point has become a flanderization of a conspiracy theorist.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 That's how I always see it. He's just a character, really.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 This recent clip that came out with Alex Jones really makes me think he's not a character.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 He's a performance artist.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Because what's the one thing you know about, what's the one thing, I shouldn't say you know,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 what's the one thing you would assume about Alex Jones, that he was very well prepared for anything that comes his way, right?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I'm sure that he has a nice legal assortment of weapons, and I'm sure he has a huge amount of food.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 One, I know he sells, or I used to watch the show back in the day.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 He sold like those MREs, those, you could buy a year's worth of food on a, on a like a pallet.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 The survivalist stuff. I'm sure the one thing that he is in, in this time of crisis where everyone's locked in their house,

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'm sure the one thing he's not hurting for is food. I'm sure he's been preparing for this for a long time.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Now, he shares joint custody of two daughters with his ex-wife, and of course, a parent's gonna want to watch out for their kids, right?

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But let me play you this clip. Let me play you, it's actually a series of clips.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Let me play you this series of clips of him talking about what may happen in the near future.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors. You think I like sizing up my neighbor, how I'm gonna haul him up by chain and chop his ass up? I'll do it.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going, I'm ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You know what? I'm ready. My daughters aren't starving to death. I'll eat my neighbors.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You know, my baby's coming to the equation. I will cook your ass up so fast and I'll tell him, oh, I killed a cow out back, baby.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Here it is, because my baby's ain't gonna die for your crap, your failure. I will eat your leftist ass like corn on the cob. I'm ready.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'll barbecue your ass flat. I will eat you. I'll drink your blood. You understand that?

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I will hang your ass up and cut you into cutlets like a filet mignon and grill your ass before I watch my daughters starve to death.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Let me tell you something right now. I swear to God, it's the last thing I do. I'm gonna get my hands around your throat.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That's an act. That's a joke, right? Like, that's not... He said those things. He really did say those things. That's not true.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 That's not true. You have years worth of food, at least a year worth of food. You're not gonna lie to your kid, oh, hey, I just slaughtered this cow as you realize the cow has five fingers and a wedding ring.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Also, who's he living next to if his neighbors are a bunch of leftists? And do I have to say this? Corn on the cob is one of the most delicious foods and it's great because it's like super messy and all that.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You get butter dripping off your chin, so a butt is not comparable to a corn on the cob. An arm? Oh, dude, I'll eat your arm like a corn on the cob. That would work.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Can you imagine taking a human butt? And dude, heaven help you if you're doing it like down the crack?

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Like, I was just imagining from cheek to cheek like corn on the cob, but if you're like spreading that, ugh, gross.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I don't care if my neighbor's butt is attached to someone who I'm not politically aligned with. I'm not eating it like corn on the cob.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 If I was starving, I'm still not eating like corn on the cob. Flaminion, maybe? A rump roast?

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I love it too because basically when he says, "I'll drink your blood," I was like, oh, he believes that Ellen DeGeneres is eating babies.

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Like, the whole clip is perfect. What I love about it, and again, it's a series of clips. He's saying other stuff in between this, but this is just cannibal-eating stuff.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It's almost like he made his point in the first-- that clip is about a minute, 10 seconds long. He made his point in the first five, six seconds, right?

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'll eat you. If I run out of food, I'll eat you and I'll feed my kids. He just goes on and on. It's just perfect. Perfect Alex Jones.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And I really do think, again, that it's character. His ex-wife doesn't, though. She's trying to use this as evidence that he wants to murder his neighbors, which, again, I don't think he's going.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You know, again, I'm pretty sure I'm right that Alex Jones-- in the early days, he really believed that he was a 9/11 true thrower. Nowadays, I think he's-- it's a character.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I don't think it'll work. However, and when I say I don't think it'll work, I don't mean you can't murder people and eat them. That can work. It's been proven to work.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I don't think this will work to help take away custody of the kids. The FDA, though, stepped in and apparently he was saying that his supplements-- he's known for two things, being a conspiracy theorist and selling supplements.

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He was marketing one of his collidal silver supplements. Why would you do this, Alex? I don't-- I mean, you're a reasonably smart dude.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And you've dug some holes and you've fallen into them. And again, that happens to everyone in the medium.

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 You knew when you said that your supplements could treat COVID-19 that the extra $10,000 worth of supplements you sold that month would not be worth having the federal government take a look at you.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I don't get it. I don't get it. But if his neighbors start disappearing, if we start finding human butts with those little corn cob holders poked on either side, we know who to look for.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But otherwise, I think it's just hyperbole. And a man-- you know, you have to wonder. A man who has a year's supply worth of food, even the thought of eating his neighbors crossing his mind, that is weird.

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And you're like, Jason, it doesn't matter how much food someone has. It's always weird. I don't know.

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Alexandra, you got the carbonicoptor ready. We are headed out to New York.

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 I found this website the other day. It blew my mind. I spent probably two hours on the website. I went to every single page I could find because it was gold.

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And we'll be covering it a couple more times during this week, or we might spread it out a little bit more, depending on how you guys receive it.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 But it's a website that-- oh, god, it's like gold to me. It is totally-- it's like a web 1.0 website. You got animated little gift banners. There's a visitor counter.

69
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Every time someone new visits the page, it goes up by one. Remember those, dude? I love those.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And the name of it is so generic, you can't help just be charmed by this. Black background, blue lettering, and it's updated to this day. This isn't some old thing.

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Vampire website.net. Vampire website.net. And you know the guy who started-- I believe his name is Steven-- goes, oh, I can't believe I got it. Vampire website.

72
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That was the generic title I really wanted to sell my vampire lifestyle. Steven. And I could be getting his wrong and his name wrong, but it doesn't matter.

73
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 What's important is he is a real life vampire. He's a 100% authentic vampire. He drinks human blood. And he has a lot of really good tips on this website.

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 One, hang out with Emoke. This is 100% a serious website, okay? This is not-- okay, let me say this. If this is a parody website, this guy needs to quit whatever job he has and go right for every comedy show possible.

75
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 At the same time, because it convinced me that I'm 100%-- okay, I'm 98% sure that this is a real legit website, because there is-- it has to be. It has to be. The amount of lunacy available in this-- however, he does say-- this is one of the things that I found way late in my research that made me think this might be suspicious.

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 He does say that vampires should hang out with emo people because they like to cut themselves anyways, so there's always blood hanging out.

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He goes-- this vampire lord, the Dark Vampire King Steven, believes that you shouldn't kill people, which is good. You should tell Alex Jones that before he starts eating people.

78
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 You should take the blood willingly, so he takes-- has hyper-nerving needles. He finds emo kids. They have to be over 18, though. He's very clear on that. He is not-- he may be a bloodthirsty creature of the night, but he's not a pervert.

79
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 He sticks the needles in people over the age of 18 and then pulls out their blood and then drinks it, right?

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Like, I-- but you feel like that wouldn't be super nutritious, or-- no human blood is nutritious, but, like, you put it in your-- like, you spray it in your mouth like it's that breath spray?

81
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Or do you get a bunch of vials and then, like, fill a tomato full of it and then, like, eat the tomato? I don't know. I'm not a vampire.

82
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But it's a good thing I'm not a vampire, because according to his web-- according to his website, vampires can grow old and die.

83
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So, what's the point of being a vampire if you're not immortal? You-- you just want a crippling addiction to he-- he mogulobin'? Oh, yeah, sign me up.

84
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 The whole point of being a vampire is being super strong, super fast, which he says that vampires can still be super strong and super fast.

85
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 However, they simply age slowly, can get diseases and die. Well, then that's not cool, man.

86
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 You have all the powers to Superman, and then, as you're stopping to crime and bullets are flying at you, the guy's like, "Except you're not below roof!"

87
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Like, if I'm gonna turn into a wretched spirit, I wanna be able to live forever. I guess maybe not. I guess you don't wanna be miserable forever.

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Anyways, so I learned-- hang out with emo kids. I learned that vampires get sick and old, they just age much slower.

89
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And I learned this most important lesson, 'cause I just went to the-- I was researching another story and clicked on a link and it brought me here.

90
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And at the top of the page in bright red blood red, I should say, blood red lettering, everything else is black background, blue writing.

91
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It says, "There is very important notice for us vampires out there, or vampire wannabes." Quote, "Vampires aren't immune to the coronavirus."

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Whoa! Oh my God, I didn't think-- when I was sitting there in full-blown mental delusion thinking I was actually a creature of darkness that drank human blood to survive,

93
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I did not think that an actual real disease could kill me, a made-up creature. But he lets us know. The master of midnight, Stephen, lets us know.

94
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Here's a quote, "Though vampires are more resilient to catching viruses and less affected by viruses if they do get sick, no one is immune to coronavirus.

95
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 If you know that you are sick with the coronavirus, you should quarantine yourself by remaining indoors and avoiding contact with other people as much as possible for two weeks."

96
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Though it's nice to know that the vampire lords do follow CDC guidelines, but you're a virus, bro. The whole point of vampires is that they drain life and turn you into a vampire.

97
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 You are-- you're worse than the coronavirus. You've plagued the globe for centuries.

98
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 You're gonna stay indoors? What? He goes on to then list death rates for the current wildly wrong death rates right now. And again, it's updated to the day.

99
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But when I checked this on April 29, 2020, it said it had a fatality rate of 7.09%. It's 100% not true. 100% not true.

100
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Not only is the king of chaos Stephen here wrong about whether or not vampires exist, it's like they say it's anywhere between .1 to .04.

101
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 But I don't even know why I'm looking at actual data, because I have a real-life vampire here who can tell me about this.

102
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 He then goes on to let us know how dangerous the coronavirus-- a vampire.

103
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 A vampire who wants to drink emo kids over 18? Emo adults blood? Are they're emo adults? I think at that point you just become goth.

104
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 The thing they're like Pokemon. They start off as emo, and then they evolve into goth, and then they just evolve into someone who works at a call center. That's their final form.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 You're a living virus, right? Vampires are a parasite. There's nothing symbiotic about it. No one wants you around.

106
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You're a creature of misery. You're the virus, bro. You're the ones that we quarantine ourselves from.

107
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 There is no-- this guy has no sense of irony to be wearing-- he has full fangs and a cape, and he's like, "Stay in your house."

108
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But after 14 days, feel free to visit the industrial club on Marcus Street. I will be there to drain your blood safely, however.

109
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 How would a-- if this is true-- it's not-- okay, wait. Let me take that back. This is not true in the sense that vampires don't have to worry about getting coronavirus, because vampires don't exist.

110
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But how would you go about being a monster like this in an age of something like coronavirus? I know there's always been that thing about, like, do vampires get AIDS,

111
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 and how AIDS have affected the vampire community, but because AIDS was an immune disease-- I think in the internal logic of vampires, AIDS is an immune disease system.

112
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It's an immune system disease, is what I mean. Vampires don't have an immune system, because they're dead.

113
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 But according to this guy, he is-- they're still alive. They're just normal people who like to drink the blood of emo kids.

114
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 That's his definition of vampire. That's his definition of vampire. Yes, you can get coronavirus. I just find it stupid.

115
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And how are they dealing with this? How are they dealing with the quarantine themselves? It's been a month and a half.

116
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Have they been stocking up blood?

117
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Whoa, I do not even think about this. What if Alex Jones is really one of these vampires, dude? He is aging quite slowly.

118
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He sells colloidal silver to cure COVID-19. That could be to trick all of the werewolf members of his audience, and finally the long war between the lichen and the vampires will be over, because they all listen to Alex Jones.

119
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Alex Jones, AJ, always juicy.

120
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Who's talking about you? Who wants to eat your cake? Corn cob on the ass.

121
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 That being aside, vampirewebsite.net. You should know if you're a vampire right now, if you're listening to this episode, and you didn't know about that amazing website, I might have just saved your life.

122
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 You might have been ready to break quarantine and being like, "What? Coronavirus can't get me? I'm an undead creature from hell."

123
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But remember, here are the symptoms. Pink eye?

124
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 How would you even have these symptoms as a vampire? A cough? Or maybe you're just coughing?

125
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Okay, with that joke, Alexandra fire up the carbonicopter. She's just looking at me. She's like, "Uh-uh."

126
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Everyone else takes off on the carbonicopter without me after that joke. Now I'm walking all alone.

127
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 We're actually headed back to America. So being we all teleport, I don't care if you guys flew away without me.

128
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We're all in America right now. This is a really weird one. We're at the Anza Borrego State Park in Borrego Springs, California.

129
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 This one I got to give a shout out to some Twitter followers, because we get to a piece of the story where I had to kind of reach out.

130
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So I want to give a shout out to Jay Hold, Jack Elpato, Sam, and Kaden. All of them helped me out on this.

131
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And I got to say this too, this is a story that may be a lark. And we kind of get to something at the ending where you may go, "Well, that's fake."

132
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But it could be a lark, 100%. What I think is weird is that it seems to be a very long lark that was one just discovered, two, kind of hard to discover in the first place.

133
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It could be, but it seems like a real long con on this one. This is weird. Okay, so, and this was Vinny. He's at Gruel Society.

134
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He was posting all this stuff, and all these are on the show notes.

135
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So, Andes of Borrego State Park is a state park in Borrego Springs, California. We actually did a story. I think we did two stories about that area.

136
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 One of them was the skeleton with the glowing light in his chest, and I know that one was one of those stories.

137
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Well, on April 3, 2020, Vinny starts talking about this weird thing that him and his friend Jason have found on a review website of the state park.

138
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So, right there, you think lark, right? These guys are trying to start some sort of ARG, but all of these things they find are years and years past, four or five years ago.

139
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 There was an earthquake in March 2020 in Andes of Borrego State Park. There was an earthquake, and Vinny says that his friend Jason sent him some reviews about the Andes of Borrego State Park.

140
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Now, that's not weird. People review all sorts of stuff, right? You go to a park, you're like, "What? There was no parking."

141
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Okay, I'm done with those. Like, oh, you know, it was too arid. I thought I was going to be able to, like, I don't know, like, see some deer, but it was a desert.

142
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I was one star, you know, stuff like that. But anyways, there's a series of reviews about the Andes of Borrego State Park from a couple years ago, three, four years ago.

143
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 They're written in Spanish, and Google automatically translates them. And this was the first one that was noted.

144
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 "In the future, there will be survivors of a VTR catastrophe for a transmission of the future."

145
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And that's all it says. I actually verified that that is in the Google reviews for Andes of Borrego State Park. That's all it says. What? What does that even mean?

146
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Vinny and Jason begin digging up these other reviews. So then you have these other reviews, other questionable reviews pop up.

147
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And all of them have a set of coordinates, and both of these came about in 2018. Both of these reviews are written by different people in 2018.

148
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 There are coordinates that point to a mountain in the Andes of Borrego State Park.

149
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 33.081, 116.300. So that's the Longitudinal Attitude.

150
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 One of the quotes says, "The coordinates is the help location and is about 1200 meters from the place in 42 years. Please attend. It is something we may not know in that year, but as long as we keep it in mind."

151
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Here's some other reviews. These are all written by different people. One review says, "VTR virus is here."

152
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 The other review says, "Ococo will know if you do not have an in-process evacuation there." Another review, "Black Hole NASA virus."

153
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 We have another review. Still, these are a few years ago.

154
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 To tell the truth, and this one was written in English. This one wasn't a Google translated one.

155
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 To tell the truth, I do not know very well the reality of the message received from NASA.

156
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But with the age that I will have, I hope I can keep following those coordinates to keep up with the information.

157
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It seems to be a current of beliefs in the beyond what happens at the moment, but well, we do not lose anything, I suppose.

158
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 When I said this was not Google translate, that does not mean that it was well written, but I'll continue here.

159
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But well, we do not lose anything, I suppose. We should do something so that NASA stops hiding things like this.

160
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Even though the rest of the world does not matter at all. There are many possibilities of these people are rescued, so not to end up that way.

161
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 We eventually get to review that seems to kind of start to make sense of this stuff.

162
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And this was a Google translate one. In the year 2057, there will be a virus called VTR. It is new to babies.

163
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It is close to the Mexico border. NASA captured an audio of this place and there will be only 250 survivors.

164
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So now the mystery is getting a little more concrete. First off, it could be a glitch, it could be bad at Google translate.

165
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But looking through these reviews, you think, "Why are we getting stuff like VTR virus? Where are they getting the coordinates from?"

166
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 In the first place, "Where is the year 2057 coming from?" But you keep seeing people mentioning this.

167
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Now, this is also where I have to reach out to Twitter for some information, because we start to see something called "Underground Base 101" which is from Fallout 3.

168
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So at this point I'm thinking, "Is this some sort of game gone wrong? Is it possible that Vinny and Jason, when they are looking through these reviews,

169
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 and stumbling down this rabbit hole, that they didn't recognize the reference "Underground Base 101?"

170
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So we'll get to that in a second, but that is something that they start talking about.

171
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Now, just because it's called "Underground Base 101" does that mean that everything else is to be dismissed? Not yet. Not yet.

172
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 But let's talk about how they're getting this information, how they're getting these quotes and everything like that.

173
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So in 2016, on June 24th, 2016, so predating even the earliest review. The earliest review was three years ago.

174
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 This video came out four years ago. There was a video put out on YouTube, and there may be an earlier version on YouTube of this video.

175
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 This was the earliest one I could find. It was titled "Help Message 2057".

176
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So this video, "Help Message 2057", was uploaded on June 24th, 2016. It has about 39,000 views, which is not a lot, as far as YouTube goes,

177
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 especially a video that's four years old. It's on a channel known as VictorG with only 169 subscribers.

178
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 There was one part... The first comment on this YouTube video, the guy says, "It was a Spanish translation. I had to translate it myself."

179
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But it basically said, "This is from Fallout 3. This is a code that you hear when you first walk into underground base 101. This is a total LARP, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

180
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And to be fair, I'm actually taking a big gamble, because it's possible that what I'm about to play you actually is from Fallout 3.

181
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And you're like, "Jason, this is a video game. This is 100% a LARP, and you fell for it." I don't know.

182
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I reached out, I played this audio clip, I posted this audio clip on Twitter and asked people, "Is this from Fallout 3?"

183
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And the people... I've never played the game. The people who I announced earlier, El Pato and Kayden and Jack and Joel and Sam said, "No."

184
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 No, that's not from Fallout 3.

185
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But the first comment on this YouTube thing was, "That's on Fallout 3." And the very first time you get to base 101, this recording starts playing.

186
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I could not verify that. I went to the Fallout 3 Wiki, I went to the underground base 101 Wiki, I could find nothing to verify that.

187
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And so again, I'm taking a big chance here. You guys could be like, "Jason, that's obviously video game."

188
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But the idea is this. This is the myth behind this sound clip I'm about... It's 10 minutes long. I'm not going to play the whole clip for you.

189
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But this is the myth.

190
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 A NASA satellite picked up a transmission from the year 2057.

191
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It clearly says towards the end of the video, and I would recommend you guys checking it out, the whole thing yourself. It's kind of interesting.

192
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I just can't play the whole 10 minutes. It says towards the end of the video.

193
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 The year is 2057. We're in danger. We need your help.

194
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And supposedly the backstory to this is... I feel dumb even talking about this actually, because again, it's probably a lark.

195
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 But anyway, so here we go. As much as I was joking about Alex Jones putting out crazy stuff earlier.

196
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 NASA intercepted a transmission from the future, and then somehow it escaped the NASA servers and got put on the dark web, and now it's back on the surface web.

197
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Okay, so let me play you some sound clip and then we'll talk a little bit about it.

198
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Oh, and if you're wearing headphones, you might want to turn the volume down. I can only correct it so much.

199
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 We're down here. We're down here. I repeat, we are down here.

200
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Alpha-3, Alpha-3, 1, 2, 1, click the bar.

201
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Alpha-3, 1, 2, 1, click the position. Over.

202
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 But whatever the mission looks like, we have no larger locations.

203
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 They just trapped in four waves. I repeat, they just trapped in four waves. All of our locations are down.

204
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 We need to book here. We need to book here. We are dying. I repeat, we are dying.

205
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 We have no more food, and we have no clean water. We just have clean water for two or three days. Stop.

206
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I repeat, we just have clean water for two or three days. Stop.

207
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 All the water in the song is contaminated. I repeat, all the water in the song is contaminated.

208
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 All the people is dying. All people are dying.

209
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 All the earth is on the ground. We are going to come back again.

210
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 We are going to get 450 survivors underground.

211
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 So what he is saying, so this is the story, again you can listen to the whole nine minutes.

212
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 They are in an underground bunker at the coordinates I gave you earlier. So this is being sent from the year 2057.

213
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 There is some virus called the VTR virus that has either wiped out most of humanity or wiped out anyone around them.

214
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 The guy keeps saying all the animals have been killed. We don't have enough food, but it is never listed as like a global catastrophe.

215
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He is walking outside the bunker, and that is why it sounds like he is walking outside.

216
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He is like, I am outside the bunker so I can get this transmission through.

217
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Of course there is some, it is an interesting thing. If it is a LARP, it is definitely a long con.

218
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 This was released back in 2016, and then you just had a couple reviews here and there.

219
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 They didn't really seem to come of anything.

220
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 But the most likely answer is obviously someone is having a laugh. That is the most likely answer.

221
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But that is not the funnest answer all the time. Sometimes it is the most satisfying because it is actually an end to a mystery.

222
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps and look at this thing.

223
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 I think it is an interesting conspiracy. I think it is a very well built conspiracy.

224
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Because one, you have to stumble across it.

225
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 There are a lot of conspiracy theories that I don't cover. They are so mainstream, right?

226
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 You just kind of can't even avoid them. Moon landings, fake, everything like that.

227
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I like the conspiracy theories that you stumble across. You kind of just have to find.

228
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Never be a news article written about this. You won't see the Daily Mail talking about this.

229
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Alex Jones isn't covering this as far as I know he might. He should. I think it is interesting.

230
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Let's pretend it is real though for a second. Let's pretend it is real. Let's think about how it could be real.

231
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Because what you would need, he apparently, the narrator of this video, seems to know that the fact that he is from the future is important.

232
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Because he ends the video saying, "I'm going to tell you what the date is. I'm going to tell you what the date is."

233
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 He likey. If I think about it, if I was talking to someone from May 2nd, 2020, when I'm recording this,

234
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I want to be like, "Hey, guess what? Guess what day it is?"

235
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Because they'll be like, "May 2nd, 2020?" I'm like, "Exactly."

236
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Like, obviously I wouldn't make a big deal about it, right? We live in the same time period.

237
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But if I was talking to someone from the past, you would have to kind of build them up to that.

238
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And he goes, "I'll tell you what date it is. I'll tell you what date it is."

239
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 It's February 17th, 2057.

240
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 So, it's specifically implied at the end of the transmission.

241
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And in the transmission, he does say, "These are my coordinates."

242
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Which again, looking up Fallout 3, that game takes place in DC, I believe. I had to do a bunch of research on that.

243
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So that didn't match up either.

244
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And Underground Base 101 does have a transmission, but it's nothing like that.

245
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 It's a little robot voice telling you about some mission you went on or something or something like that.

246
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But it's interesting because he keeps asking for help. He's saying they're running out of food, they're running out of water.

247
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 There's only 250 people left in this facility at these coordinates underneath the Anza Varego State Park.

248
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It's the mountain... The GPS points specifically to a mountain in that park.

249
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 First off, he's asking for assistance because they don't have a lot of food and water.

250
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 It ends with him asking for help and vehicles. Help and vehicles is what he keeps saying.

251
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Which in this context, when someone's saying, "I'm going to tell you what the date is,"

252
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 again, if he was trying to talk to people from the year 2057, they're like, "Yeah, get on with it. We know what date it is. We have a calendar."

253
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It makes me think that he knows he's speaking to the past.

254
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So could the vehicles he be asking for actually be time-machine?

255
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Now, obviously, the whole thing, the most rational answer is that it's all fake.

256
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 But again, it is an interesting mystery.

257
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 It's built in an area that most of us will never be able to visit.

258
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Not because, you know, like we're afraid of skeletons with giant glowing orbs in their chest,

259
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 but because you pretty much have to live in that area of California.

260
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 You're not going to, you know, go, "Hey, baby, let's break the quarantine and drive out to a desert.

261
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Let's drive out to a state park." And they were going to wander around the mountains for a while.

262
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 You would, one, pretty much have to live in the area.

263
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Two, have to be comfortable with hiking around the mountains, looking for underground entrances and things like that.

264
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 So it's in the perfect location. If it was, there's a house in Detroit,

265
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 and if you go through the door, you can help us from the year 2057. It would be much easier to expose.

266
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 But out in the middle of nowhere, literal nowhere, this is a perfect little mystery.

267
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 What I think is odd was the progression of it.

268
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 So that's now that we kind of know the order of things.

269
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 This video, the earliest example we see is in 2016.

270
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 People must have been plugging in these coordinates, finding out the coordinates point to Anza Borrego State Park,

271
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 and then leaving reviews at the state park.

272
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 So that's weird, right? They're not commenting on the YouTube video itself.

273
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 They're going to a Google review site and leaving the reviews there in Spanish,

274
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 which leads me to a very believable conspiracy theory, because this happens all the time.

275
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And if you have a keen eye, you can spot it. I've spotted it one time,

276
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 to the point where I actually contacted an FBI agent and got the FBI involved.

277
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I spotted it one time back in 2002. I came across the code, came across the code online,

278
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 and I was actually at my job at the time, was working for Gateway Computers,

279
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 and FBI agent was there, contacted the FBI, just kind of turned around and said, "Hey, Special Agent, what's up?"

280
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 He was there, investigating, we were having this massive theft problem at Gateway.

281
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 There was a guy at a Gateway store near us, the store manager was stealing plasma TVs.

282
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 They were $4,000 a long time ago. I can only think you can spend $4,000 on a television.

283
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Nowadays, plasma TVs were $4,900 to be specific, but he was stealing the TVs out of his own inventory,

284
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 selling them on eBay, and the feds got him.

285
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And the FBI agent was talking to my store manager, and I go, "Hey, can I ask you a question?"

286
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 And I told him the story, and I printed up the code, and he looks at it, and he's like,

287
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 "This is weird. This is really, really weird, because it was on a forum where everyone is having normal conversations,

288
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and every so often someone would start speaking in a bizarre code,

289
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 and then other people would respond in an equally bizarre code."

290
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And then mixed in with that was regular conversation.

291
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 It's a way for spies, it's a way for intelligence, gathering communities to communicate with each other.

292
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 What you do is you could have an agency wants to put out a message, they put out this video.

293
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I've talked about this before on the show. They put out the, let's say that I'm a spy in Istanbul.

294
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 I put a video out that no one will probably ever see.

295
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I'm not saying that Victor G is part of some sort of intelligence network,

296
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 but I could have released an audio file full of all of the details of my report, looking into Istanbul's politics or whatever.

297
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 I'm a CIA agent. So I record a goofy audio track, put it on the internet.

298
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Now, it's just going to float around there, and if anyone stumbles across it,

299
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 they will think nothing of it. They'll think it's gibberish, or they'll think it's fake,

300
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 or they'll think it's actually a time travel.

301
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Really, this agent in country A wants to get a message to country B.

302
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And how does the people in country B communicate using the internet?

303
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 You know the second part is all the agents who are assigned to this case go to Google reviews

304
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and leave reviews in coded messages as well.

305
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You go, "Jason, that is more far-fetched than time travelers from the future." It's not.

306
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 There's codes hidden in photographs, little gifts, and JPEGs all the time.

307
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 You've come across, I can guarantee you, on your time on the internet,

308
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 you have come across coded messages between intelligence agencies.

309
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 They use the surface web, because it's not suspicious.

310
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 You just post weird stuff no one's ever going to know.

311
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 If you don't know the code, you'll never know it's there.

312
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 So, to me, this smells more like a spook operation than an actual time traveler.

313
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And that's definitely more believable that you have human assets in the field using these communications.

314
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And again, I'm not implying Victor G's part of this, or Jason and Vinny, the Twitter people are.

315
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I'm just saying that that, it seems like that. It seems like that to me.

316
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Just because if it was just a video existing, I would just think somebody made a LARP video

317
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 and said, "Oh, this came on the deep web, and really it was him and his buddies in the basement."

318
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 The fact that you have people, unrelated people, the fact that you have other people

319
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 opening accounts to review a state park online and leaving stuff referring to a video

320
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 that only 40,000 people had seen over the course of five years is weird.

321
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I can understand a big blockbuster movie coming out, and it takes place there.

322
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And people leave reviews, I get that, but there's a little review, this little video that comes out.

323
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And then you have people posting reviews talking about it.

324
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 That seems like an odd combination.

325
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 But again, we're talking about time travel from the year 2057,

326
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 a VTR virus ravaging the planet, and 250 survivors trapped underground.

327
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 So I guess in that case, the whole story is weird.

328
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 But it's one of those interesting conspiracies that just gets lost in all of the moon landings

329
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and JFK and Adrena Chrome and all that stuff.

330
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 All this normy conspiracy theories just kind of dominate the sphere.

331
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And these little guys just kind of slide right through.

332
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Could be a cry for help from a probably now long dead time traveler.

333
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Or that slipping through motion, that sliding underneath all the other nonsense on the internet.

334
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Could be the perfect way to pass a message to your handler in Washington, DC,

335
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 that everything is going according to plan.
