1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 How much money would you pay to rent a fat person?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And then we take a look at a man who believes in the Bible.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 To the word, some may say.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Really, really likes the good book.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 He likes it so much.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 You don't want to share a room with him today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hope you guys are having lots of fun.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I don't. I hate doing stuff on my days off.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Like, I literally, I become a potato bug and just lay on the, lay on the couch

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 or lay on my recliner and watch YouTube or movies or whatever.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I don't want to do nothing.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 So, so those are your fun plans.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I totally agree with you.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But other people like hang gliding and like climbing stuff.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And that's fine for you.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's fine for you to do.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm not into that, but you know, I'm not going to judge if you like doing like floating around.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It's weird, right?

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Weird swimming is so bizarre.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Like we go to dangerous places to like hang out and like chill.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It doesn't make any sense.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 The water kills people all the time.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm like just for like an alien because I live by a river.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And I'm always standing, I'm always standing there like some big freak,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 this Jason shaped silhouette under a tree.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And I go, why would you go?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 You know what?

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 It's my day off.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Let me bring my family down to one of the deadliest places on earth.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Lakes, water, river.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 You don't drown on land.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Unless you're reading that Sherlock Holmes novel, The Man Drowned on Land.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You know what I mean?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 It's like super deadly.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And sure you got inner tubes and sea dues and boats and like scuba gear.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You put your toddler in some scuba gear.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Hold on kids.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But it's so dangerous.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I don't get it, but people like doing it.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 People do.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 People swim way more than they jump out of airplanes.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And I would say jumping out of an airplane probably has a better survival rate than swimming.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Don't look up the percentages.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You're like Jason, people swim literally every day since the beginning of time.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And it's not even close to the percentage.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Whatever.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I don't want to talk about percentages.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 You know who I do want to talk about is coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our newest Patreon supporter.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Walking in with little arm floaties.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He's like, oh, I really wanted to swim today.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It's Shoko Chattington.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Everyone give Shoko a big round of applause.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Shoko, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And let's take a look at this awesome fan art for Fan Art Friday.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I got this a while ago.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 The fan art's really been backing up and it's my fault and I love it.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I love having all of this art that's coming in.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Check this out.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I got it from the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 This is from Caffeine Roulette.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's a real kind of like throwback.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I remember my days of walking around with a big boom box walking when I was character in Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 You know, you have the boom box and you got a little Dead Rabbit Radio symbol.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I love it.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's great.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Thank you so much for providing this caffeine roulette.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Now, let's go ahead.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Shoko, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robot.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 We're going to now journey across the most dangerous place on the planet.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 We are headed, I bet you more people have died in the ocean than have died in the desert.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Right?

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 You're like, "Are you still on this?"

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I'm just statistically, right?

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I'm sure more people have died in drowning than in the desert.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And more people have died from starvation than Dreadless Shokos.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Can you just tell us where we're going?

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So at least I can start rowing there while you're going off in the desert.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 We're headed to Japan, Shoko.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Let's grab an oar.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Splishity Splash.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Splishity Splash as we're rowing all the way out to Japan.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Anyway, so, well actually that's a good segue.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Speaking of dying of hunger, we're walking around Japan and we're like, "Dude, we sure are hungry."

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And so we walk into this restaurant, we'll go to like a Pizza Hut or something.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And there's a bunch of pizza there and we're like eating it on them.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 We're like, "Jakals are fighting over the last piece."

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And then the people of Japan go, "Dude, you guys eat so much pizza, you have now won the mega pizza of Japan."

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 We're like, "Well, we didn't know this was a thing."

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And so they bring out this giant, it's like the biggest pizza we've ever seen.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And we're like looking across the vast expanse of the...

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I can't even see on the other end of the table.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I see the curve of the earth and then I see the top of your head.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 We're looking at this massive pizza and you go, "This is weird, how could we ever possibly eat this much pizza?"

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And in walks, the employees...

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Are they the employees? Some might call them heroes.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 They are the employees of Debukari.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They're walking in and they're all overweight. They're all big old fat people.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Now I'm not judging them, right? I'm overweight myself.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But it's a descriptor that even they are very well aware of.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Debukari means, literally, fat rent.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And they look at each other and they look at us and they go,

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 "Hey, you guys need help with the mega pizza of Japan?"

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And we're like, "Yeah." And then the fat people started eating all the pizza.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And soon the pizza has been devoured.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 That was a very, very long-winded way to build up this image that you can in Japan.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 This is totally real. The mega pizza isn't real, right?

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 If you're flying out there to order one of those right now, you're like, "Oh, I'm so hungry."

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 That's not real.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 But in Japan, there's a business called Debukari. They rent fat people.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And the idea is, is you pay $19 an hour to hang out with a fat person.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And you go, there's so many thoughts that pop in your head, right?

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Like, first off, why do I listen to this podcast?

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But after you've come to the conclusion that you're here forever,

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 you start to think, "Okay, why would I need a fat person to hang out with me?"

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And Debukari has kind of predicted this, so they give you a list of reasons.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You're a modeling agency and you need someone to model triple-X-sized clothes.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 You could be cheap and just get a regular model and then use the stretch tool and Photoshop,

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 or just hire a fat person to come and try on the clothes.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 That'll probably sell more, right?

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Instead of making it look like Daffy Duck got hit by an anvil and they're wearing the dress you really want.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 You get them. That's the one reason why you'd want to hire a fat person from them.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Now, aside from that, I could see that there are plus-size modeling agencies.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Aside from that, none of these other...this seems like a failed business on its face.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 None of these other ideas are going to make any sense at all.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 One of them is you want to buy clothes for a fat person, but you don't want to ask what size they wear.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 You can spend $19 to take another fat person shopping and then buy those clothes? What?

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 The fat person you rented is like, "Oh, I thought I was going to take all those clothes. Oh, I'm so sad."

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 You're giving them to your true friend. They're like, "Oh."

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Here's another one. Let's say that you're into cosplay.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And one of the characters in the show you watch is a fat dude, but you're not fat.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You want to be the sidekick or...I have no idea. This is in...this is part of their list.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I'm trying to picture this. Let's say that you want to go as full-metal alchemist.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 You want to be the skinny little dude in it? This show I saw once at 1 a.m.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 You're the skinny little dude and then you want the big guy in the armor next to you.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 You can hire a fat guy and then spend thousands of dollars to custom make this armor for him.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But one of them is I need help eating a large portion of the restaurant.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And I don't think I've ever come across that problem in my life.

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I've never been like sitting at a restaurant and finishing up my meal.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And I see a young maid sitting there like, "What's the matter?"

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And she's like, "I just can't eat all of these wontons."

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 By the time she's even finished that sentence, I've already eaten her wontons.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I'm like, "I don't see a problem here, lady. They're already gone."

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I've never come across that.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But here's a great one because it lists these on the website.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The Debukari listed this. One of the things they put on here was,

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 "I want to look thinner in a picture so I need a fat person to stay next to me."

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 That's cold. Imagine if you're getting the job.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They're like, "Hey, you've been rented out. I just imagine it's like Joker."

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 There's just a guy who's like chain smoking. He has a whole sweatshop full of fat people.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He's like, "Hey, you're going to go shopping this week.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 You're going to go to American Eagle Outfitters and try on ill-fitting clothes."

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 "Yeah, that guy goes out there."

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And the manager goes, "And you, Willie, you, you've got to go stay next to some people and make them look skinnier."

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Like, "Oh, man, I wouldn't want that job. Technically, I wouldn't want any of that."

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I might take the eating extra food portion of it.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And then the last one, this one's fun. I'd probably do this one.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 This is literally on their website. I want someone to play on a seesaw with me.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Which I don't know how many seesaws are in Japan.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I've not seen a seesaw in America in probably about 30 years.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But it would be fun if it's built to sustain some sort of human weight and not for like little kids.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And go, "Wee! I haven't been on a seesaw in so long. I think you could pay me $19 an hour to go on the seesaw with you."

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Very, very interesting thing.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 When I say interesting, I mean failed business idea that'll probably go nowhere.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And it's very clear it says this is not a sexual thing. There's no touching rule.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Devukari, you little devil. I don't believe that.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Like, if I get to the place and there's this girl there and she has all this delicious food,

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 and she's like, "Hey, I need you to help me eat this."

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 So I go in. It's like a date. There's like candles lit up.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And there's two places. And I'm like eating the food, and she's eating the food.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And then she's like, "I'm stuffed, and I'm still going ar-ar-ar-ar-ar."

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And she's like, "Oh, maybe we should retire to the bedroom. I'm still eating. I'm raiding her fridge.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I brought Ziploc bags."

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And then finally, at that point, I'm not going to say, "Listen, ma'am, sorry, there's a no touching rule.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 I'm going to be like, for another $19, I'll stay here for another hour.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 We can do a lot of stuff in an hour, ma'am."

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I probably should charge more than $19 because now I'm technically on break in the law.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 They say it's not sexual, but you can't deny that sexual attraction once it starts.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And sexual attraction comes at $19 an hour.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I will be physically and sexually attracted to you for at least $19 an hour.

187
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Shoko Chattington, that's actually a great segue.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Talking about the crime of prostitution.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Shoko's like, "Damn it! Why am I in this episode?"

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Shoko, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 We are leaving behind this very pleased woman.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 She's waving goodbye with her little handkerchief.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 We are headed all the way out to the main street.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 [imitates gunshot]

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Shoko is driving this Jason Jalopy through some pretty bad neighborhoods.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 It's a convertible. We can get shot at any moment.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But I came across this the other day. This is so fascinating to me.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 It's so fascinating to me.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Now, I've talked a lot about back when I was younger.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 You know, I got into some rough stuff.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Got into some rough stuff, right?

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 You're going to bad neighborhoods.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 You grow up in bad neighborhoods.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 You know what I mean? That type of stuff just happened.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So, I'm always so fascinated by the evolution of crime.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 The evolution of crime fighting.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Back in my day, I wasn't a bad dude or anything like that.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But, you know, I wouldn't want people to know where I was at at all times.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's just like, I'll leave it at that.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I wouldn't want people, for example, I wouldn't want people to have ring doorbell cameras.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 That boggles my mind.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I don't think back about like in the 90s and the early 2000s.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 For any detectives that are taking notes on solved crimes in Sacramento, North Island,

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 the whole area is full of unsolved crimes.

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 But nest doorbell cameras, like how do people do stuff nowadays?

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You got ring cameras everywhere. You got like, you're rolling.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And there's like two cars back. They got like a dash cam on.

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So, they see you like doing stuff.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 They see you shaking people's hands. Being nice. Being nice. I was a nice guy.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 But I don't want all my niceness captured on camera all the time, right?

221
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So, it's so weird.

222
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And I think like, how would I be the nice guy that I was back then with the technology today?

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But I, and I've always kind of had that thought like, dude, if I had Google Earth, if I had Google Earth,

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 back when I was being really cool and nice to everybody, like that'd be a game changer.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I had to use those maps. Remember they sold the, they sell some of those books of maps

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 that you would flip through and find an address.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I had to figure out the neighborhood. I got to spread that cheer.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 So, that's fascinating to me.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But I've been thinking small, because I'm an old man, see, and this is how technology advances.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I was thinking small. I was thinking, how would I be able to be as cool as I was to my community

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 and give back to the people in my community with all of this technology?

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I was thinking so small. The other day, this is a while back actually.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I've been thinking about this for a while. Me and Sabine, we went to this little gift shop here in town.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 They had a picture on their merchandise. It said, "No photos." No photos of the merchandise.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Now, I figured what was happening was people were pulling out their phones, looking up stuff on Amazon

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 and checking the price and then seeing that it's cheaper, because it's always going to be cheaper online,

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 for the most part, buying it on Amazon.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So, I asked her, I said, "Hey, is this to keep people...?"

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Because you want to know what they were doing. They were sitting on their phone in front of the merchandise

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 and you go, "Hey, what are you doing?" And they go, "Oh, I'm just taking a picture."

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 You couldn't say no surfing the web in my store unless the store was run by Joseph Stalin.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 But if it said no photos, they couldn't use that excuse. And she goes, "Oh, no, no, no. That's not why we say no photos."

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 She goes, "What's been going on? Is this?"

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It used to be back in my day that you would walk into a store, you would literally just walk and grab the first thing.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Usually it'd be a nice pair of jeans. But you walk in, you steal something, you take it out, and then you take it to a fence.

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And you say, "I have this television set. It's a thousand dollar television set. Can I get $700 for it?"

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 The fence will go, "I'll give you $300 for it." And you haggle on this, right?

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 What am I supposed to do with a thousand dollar television set? You know how hard it is to move one of these things?

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Literally, they're super heavy. It's the 1990s.

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So that's how it used to be.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Now what happens is, you can skip the fence pretty much altogether.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You can go straight to your drug dealer and say, "What do you want? What type of things are you looking for?"

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And then you can go to the store and take photos of the items and sending them to your drug dealer and being like, "Hey, do you want this? Do you want this? Do you want this?"

254
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And the drug dealer will go shopping while they're not in the store. And that's the stuff you steal.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 So you get a higher value. What am I going to do with a set of tools? I don't need tools. Don't steal tools and bring them to me.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It's the number one theft item. I got tons of tools.

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 What I don't have is some LOL dolls for my niece. So if you're able to get to Walmart and steal a bunch of LOL dolls, that's of more value to me right now than more tools.

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Because I already got a ton of those I got to sell.

259
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Fascinating evolution of technology and crime. And I just came across something the other day.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It was on, I think, the heroin subreddit. This was mind-boggling. I never would have thought about this before.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I'm not encouraging this behavior, by the way. But apparently there's a glitch in the Facebook marketplace system.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 This person goes, "I'm in a lot of trouble. I'm in a lot of trouble because I just got caught doing this.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 My bank account got shut down and they're most likely going to get investigated."

264
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 What they were doing is they were finding a hard drive online, a really nice hard drive.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And it was like, I don't know, let's just say a $300 hard drive.

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 They'd put it on the Facebook marketplace and they were selling, listed it for like 69 bucks.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 So it was selling immediately. And they'd get the money sent to them.

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And then they would immediately take it out of their bank and spend it on drugs.

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And then when they got paid, it's like a short-term loan, when they got paid, they would email the buyer and go,

270
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "Hey, I'm really sorry something fell through. So I will refund your money.

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Here's your $69, but it's like a short-term loan with no interest.

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Here's your money back."

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Well, apparently this person did this successfully for a while and then started doing it five times.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Had five different customers at a time and then had ten different customers at a time.

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So basically got $690 because they're a drug addict, right? They can't stop this behavior.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 They can't stop this behavior. They got $690.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And then the bank got shut down because the bank realized there was some fraud going on.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So this person now owes ten people $69. Facebook is looking for them.

279
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Mark Zuckerberg's literally going door to door. The bank shut the account down so even their paycheck has nowhere to go.

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 These people are complaining, "Hey, where's my hard drive? I want to refund."

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 So that, even though that enterprise went south, I think it's because she didn't know what she was doing in the end.

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Either she got too greedy or she didn't figure out the flaws.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But I find that absolutely fascinating. We can use technology.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 That crime would have been impossible to pull off when I was a kid.

285
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You had a garage sale. So not like you come to the garage sale and say, "Hey, I'll save this hard drive for $69."

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So they gave you $69 and you're like, "Oh, I'll bring the hard drive over two weeks from now."

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 You're just holding it right here. Yeah! That's a crime that only you can do on the internet.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And I know there's all way bigger crimes hacking and stuff like that.

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But I just like, "Here we go. This is the evolution."

290
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I don't know if this person thought of this or if they got it from somebody else.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 They're boned. They're boned. They're not going to get out of this. They're in a lot of trouble.

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It's so fascinating how crime marches on.

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Shoko, let's go ahead and wave goodbye to nice Jason. He's sitting there.

294
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 He has two dudes in a headlock. He's like, "Oh, these are my best buddies ever."

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 As he's walking them into like a shadowy shed off in the middle of a field.

296
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 We're waiting for that maniac.

297
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Shoko, here's the keys to the carbon helicopter. We are headed all the way out to Euless, Texas.

298
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 [imitates car noises]

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It's May 2021. And there's a man. He's just walking around his house.

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's like, "Man, what a beautiful house. Everything that God has blessed me with, I know, is special."

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Like this kitchen table. This is amazing. And look at this linoleum floor.

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 My name is Jason Allen Thornburg. And he's standing in front of his house and he goes, "And life is..."

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 [imitates car noises]

304
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 His house blows up mid-sentence. "Ahhhhh!" He jumps out of the way.

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 The breeze... It's like a 3D movie. The breeze flying right at it.

306
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 So, "Ahh!"

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Now, Jason Allen Thornburg was very lucky. God did bless him that day.

308
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 He wasn't in this house that blew up, but his roommate, Mark Jewel, was.

309
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 So, what's Jason going to do, right? He needs a place to live.

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 So, he starts staying at a local hotel.

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And the residents knew good old Jason. He'd always sit outside and he'd be reading the Bible, talking about the Bible, preaching the Bible, but in a polite way.

312
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Like, he'd hand you a flyer and say, "If you want to learn more about the Bible, if you want to know more about the works of Christ, visit me in my hotel room.

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 We'll just talk about the good old book."

314
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But the police warrant...

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Hip on this, right? They're much atheist down in Texas. They hate God.

316
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 You didn't know that the ULIS Police Department actually has a statue of Baphomet in their front yard.

317
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And have this devilish headquarters of the ULIS Police Department.

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 They actually were looking at Jason Thornburg and they go, "Well, sure, sure he worships the one true God and not the dark Lord."

319
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But also, it's very, very suspicious. He escaped that burning house.

320
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Now, they weren't... They understand that people can leave... People can and should leave places on fire.

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But the police department thought it was very... It was a very suspicious death.

322
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And it wasn't... They didn't have enough evidence to charge Jason with homicide. It was listed as an accident on the corner's paperwork.

323
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 He just died in an accident, but the police were suspicious about this.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Kind of keeping an eye on this guy.

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But, obviously, not too close of an eye.

326
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Because around September 17th, 2021, in ULIS, Texas, we're at the Mid-City Inn, this hotel.

327
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 David Louris, a 42-year-old man, is walking around Mid-City Inn.

328
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And there's Jason out there with his Bible talking about the good word.

329
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And he hands David a flyer. He goes, "Hey, you want to go back to my hotel room and chat about Jesus?"

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Now, I'm going to say this. I might be jaded, but I'm thinking that dude's trying to bang me, right?

331
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 If anyone is inviting me back to their hotel room, I'm going to assume that person wants to have sex with me.

332
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I would think that the Bible thing was just like a cover. I'd be like, "Uh, no, I'm good."

333
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I really want to read the Bible with someone I have my own little pocket Bible.

334
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I was like, "If only someone would do it with me in the park, in a public setting, I want to go to this dude's hotel room."

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But David takes him up on the offer. David goes, "Yeah, sure. I'll go to this hotel room with you, and we'll learn more about Jesus."

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 They're hanging out in the room for a while, and Jason's doing his thing.

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Put on a puppet show, put on a puppet show, the story of David and Goliath.

338
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And then Jason realizes something. This thought pops on his head, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. I got to sacrifice this dude to God."

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 That's really why he's here. The puppet show is just a bit of a distraction.

340
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So he gets up, takes his socks off. I don't actually know if he was doing a puppet show,

341
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 but the point is that they're having this conversation about the God, and then Jason pulls out a knife and slits the dude's throat.

342
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Kills him on the spot, chops up his body, throws the body parts in some plastic bins.

343
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So the police's suspicions are right. This guy's a maniac.

344
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Well, I guess allegedly a maniac. The trial's still going on.

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 This all just happened. I was surprised that this didn't make bigger news, because two days later, a female friend of Jason shows up.

346
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Just wanted to kick it with him. Want to see what he was up to?

347
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 She goes to the hotel. "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

348
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 She goes in the hotel. "Hey, hey, hey, come in." They haven't revealed this woman's name. We'll call her Tanya, though. "Hey, yeah, come on in, Tanya. Let's talk about Jesus." And he shuts the door and he goes, "Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. I got to sacrifice you."

349
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And he slits her throat, chops her up, throws her in a plastic bin. Two more days later, Jason's sitting there, he's hanging out.

350
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Another woman walks up. "Hey, Jason, how's it doing? How you doing, man? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Probably should change my blood-soaked clothes, but...

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Well, you want to come in my room and we'll talk about Jesus?" They go in the room and he's like, "Oh, you know what? I'd really like to talk about Jesus, but...

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 It's time for the sacrifice." Now, with her, what we can tell, was that he wasn't able to cut her throat. He tried.

353
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And there was a fight and he had to strangle her with his bare hands, cut her up, threw her in some plastic bins.

354
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 The reason why he was caught was because the neighbors started complaining about the smell. And they just complained to him, apparently.

355
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 They're like, "Pewwee! You should change your clothes and I don't know. Deep clean every cubic inch of your room."

356
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Because no one called the cops at this point. The reason how the cops got involved was 50 miles away.

357
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 On September 21st, there's a dumpster fire. The fire department comes to put that out. Shortly after the fire department gets there, they notify the police.

358
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Because in this dumpster are the dismembered remains of three people. They were able to trace David because of a tattoo and like a surgical pump that was in his body.

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 They had a serial number on it. They were able to find David and because they found David, they were able to find the area he was in, Mid City Inn.

360
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And they were able to connect him to Jason, who they knew that something was up with that explosion. So they asked him, "What's going on?"

361
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And that's when he started saying, "I had to sacrifice these people to God." The first David kind of just popped in my head.

362
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 We were talking about Jesus. I had to sacrifice him. They go, "What about the women?" And he goes, "Oh, that was just circumstance."

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I'm sure God loves those extra blessings, but I didn't plan on that. They just showed up randomly to see me. Both of them knew me.

364
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But they didn't know that it was time for them to be sacrificed. Had they not shown up, he never would have hunted them down.

365
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And they go, "So did you sacrifice your roommate?" And he goes, "Oh yeah, that was my sacrifice."

366
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And the cops are looking at each other and they go, "Have you sacrificed anyone else?" He's all, "No!" He's all looking sheepish there like, "Dude, are your fingers crossed?"

367
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 He's like, "Fine. I did sacrifice my girlfriend in Arizona."

368
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 The police are now looking at a bunch of unsolved murders in the areas he was at to see if they can connect them to anything else.

369
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Because this is truly random crime. I bet you anything if you asked Jason if he was a serial killer, he would probably deny it.

370
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 He's not a serial killer. He's making sacrifices to God. Serial killer kills because of sexual pleasure, or to get money out of an ATM machine, or all these other things.

371
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I was killing these people because God was telling me to. I mean, sure, I will work my way through the justice system because of that, but I'll probably be found innocent because God's mercy will shine upon me.

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Or, even if I do end up in prison, that's where God wanted me so I can spread the word of Jesus in the prison system.

373
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Like, he may be that deluded. He may be thinking that he did nothing wrong, which I find so fascinating.

374
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 But people were literally walking into his lair and he was killing them one after another. Very, very brutal killing.

375
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And I find it so interesting that 20 years ago this would have been a huge news story. But this happened in September. I didn't even know that it happened.

376
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I have true crime watch on my phone and it should be sending me alerts every time someone's murdered.

377
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 But, I mean, it's not that, but I just find it so weird that this is creepy and it's random.

378
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 It could happen to anybody. You're like Jason, wait, back up. It could only happen to people who go into weirdo's hotel rooms and you're right.

379
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 You're right, but I'm surprised it's not bigger news. A man sacrificing at least five people to God.

380
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Over the period of time it wasn't even like a mass killing or anything like that.

381
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps here and wrap up this episode.

382
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Sacrifices to God or gods is very common biblically.

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Right, we see that. We don't see really human sacrifices to God in the Bible, but we talk about that dude who was told to sacrifice his son and then God's like, "Ha, just kidding. Don't."

384
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 As the knife is about to plunge into his son's belly, there was a test.

385
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 That was a test I wanted to see if you could do it.

386
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Step two on fear factor, you have to eat this goat's balls.

387
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 But we see a lot about sacrifices in the Bible, in religion in general.

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Either it's like a personal sacrifice, like the Buddhists, or it's a physical sacrifice, animal sacrifice, and in other religions, human sacrifice.

389
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 But with our conspiracy caps fully on, imagine a world where the sacrifices work.

390
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Or more importantly, imagine a world where the sacrifices not only work, but are needed.

391
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 We look around the world and we go, "Man, so much strife and division, people are at each other's throats."

392
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 But what if it could be worse than it is?

393
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Like this is just, we're toeing the line as a people.

394
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Humanity is on that precipice.

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And the only reason it's not worse, the only reason we haven't taken the collective step into Armageddon, is because of the sacrifices.

396
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 What if there is a group of people out there that are sacrificing souls to maintain balance?

397
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 A dark God, an old God, who requires human blood directly sent to him in the form of a sacrifice.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 This organization works diligently around the clock, taking lives.

399
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 The lives that this God demands.

400
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 It seems random to us.

401
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Maybe it's a shooting in Omaha, or a bludgeoning in Maine.

402
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Maybe it's a chainsaw attack in Russia, or someone throws a box of spiders at someone in El Salvador.

403
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 The point is, is that these people are taken out as sacrifices.

404
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 What if the sacrifices work?

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And they know, this organization knows that every show often one of their members is going to get caught.

406
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You lose some people along the way, but the order remains the same.

407
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.

408
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 The rest of the world just moves on while they steer the ship.

409
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 The only thing creepier than a serial killer would be a serial killer with a mission.

410
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And the only thing creepier than a serial killer with a mission is an organization dedicated to taking innocent life day after day after day.

411
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 If you truly believe what you're doing is right, you'll never stop.

412
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And if you truly believe you serve the old God, the horrific crimes and bludgy spill in this reality

413
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 will only lead to greater rewards when you stand next to his dark throne.
