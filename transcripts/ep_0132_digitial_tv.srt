1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 A man, a sandwich, and the ultimate murder plot.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,220
 Then we take a look at the bizarre disease known as visual release hallucinations.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,280
 What are they, how do you get them?

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,920
 And did people in the past see cartoons?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,200
 It works, don't worry.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,280
 And then we take a look at a personal conspiracy theory of mine.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,660
 Why did the government pay for us to switch to digital television?

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,320
 Was it really to give people a better viewing experience?

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,400
 Was it a way to free up the airwaves for emergency personnel?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:46,520
 Or was it something to protect us from something dark, sinister, and headed this way?

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:57,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
 I hope you're having a great day too.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,200
 We're going to kind of jump into this because we got a lot to cover.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,640
 I did want to say this real quick though.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,040
 On a previous episode I told people to go see Bumblebee.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,160
 I think most of you guys know as most of you guys are reaching for the skip button.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 Give me a second.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,400
 I think most of my listeners know I'm a big Transformers fan.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,560
 I did go see Bumblebee this weekend.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,560
 Check it out.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
 I enjoyed it.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,960
 It was actually quite different from the other Transformers movies if you weren't a

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
 fan of those.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,760
 You know I described it to my little brother and I said it felt more like an early 2000

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,800
 superhero film on the level of like the original Spider-Man or the X-Men movies.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,760
 The whole movie took place in one location.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,240
 Which you know what, and I have to say this.

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,880
 I did enjoy the movie, but I have a personal bone to pick with the director.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,840
 The director of it, Travis Knight, is from Oregon and the movie is set in California.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,880
 But the whole movie I thought it was set in the Pacific Northwest because it kind of looked

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 like it.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
 It's just set in Hood River, bro.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,080
 If you're going to make a movie with Bumblebee and Optimus Prime, spoiler alert.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,840
 If you're going to make a movie with Transformers walking around on Earth, set it in Hood River.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
 Set it in a plate.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
 You grew up in the Pacific Northwest, man.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
 Set it in San Francisco.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 No.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,420
 And you don't even know what San Francisco until like maybe the last 10 or 15 minutes

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
 of it.

44
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,840
 They make kind of an offhand remark and then they show the Golden Gate Bridge at the ending.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,640
 Set it in Hood River.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
 Set it at least somewhere that I can visit.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,360
 But I would have given my left arm to simply see a film set and see the Volkswagen bug

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
 and all this stuff.

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
 I'm like, "Transform, transform, the directors like these aren't real Transformers.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
 They're just cars, dude."

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,560
 And I'm like, "Come on, you can do it, Bumblebee.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
 Transform."

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,360
 But anyways, I was really, I mean, it was basically on the level of like Herbie or E.T. was more

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 that kind of story.

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,240
 There weren't any of these huge war zones that are pretty typical for the other five

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,040
 Transformer films, but there are some robot on robot fistfights, which was cool.

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,800
 Definitely had a different feel, but I would definitely recommend going to see Bumblebee.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,080
 If you've already abandoned the franchise, but you still have a love for Transformers,

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
 I think this movie will reignite it.

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,120
 If you're not a fan of Transformers, but you're a fan of like, Bumbling Alien on Earth stories,

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 you may like it.

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,720
 But I definitely liked it.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
 But I'm a fan of the source material as well.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
 And again, it really gave a new flavor to the story, to the whole thing.

65
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
 It was weird.

66
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,280
 I don't know if they, it was kind of a reboot, kind of a prequel.

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,800
 I kind of feel they did some rewrites, because this movie was being prepped when Transformers

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,680
 5 was being released.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,840
 And Transformers 5 totally bombed.

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,980
 Well, it didn't totally bombed, but it didn't make as much money as they thought it was

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,980
 going to.

72
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,480
 So I'm wondering if they did some rewrites to kind of make it more of a reboot, because

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,400
 it kind of had a toe in each set of water.

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,320
 But in Transformers 5, it explained that Bumblebee actually helped fight the Nazis, and in this

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,600
 movie, Bumblebee leaves Cybertron for the first time.

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,520
 So, and, and I did a previous episode about the theory that Optimus Prime is a murderous

77
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,480
 psychopath, and that's Michael Bay's subversive take on American politics.

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,640
 And this one, Optimus Prime is not a total lunatic killing machine.

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,440
 So, interesting take on the source material, Travis.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
 But I did enjoy it.

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,360
 So, I wanted to go ahead and talk about that, though.

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,920
 I do recommend saying it's a good Christmas movie, especially if you have kids as well.

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 Or you're a kid at heart.

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
 And no, I'm not being sponsored by Bumblebee.

85
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,840
 The, or who made it, Paramount?

86
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
 I'm not being sponsored by them either.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,640
 I'm not being sponsored by anybody.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,880
 So if you want to sponsor me, hit me up, DeadRapRadiogmail.com.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
 We're going to go ahead and jump into our first story, though.

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
 Our first story, this happened back in June of 2018, so very, very recent.

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
 We don't have a lot of details as far as like what's going to happen with this.

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,320
 But if you work in an office or you work anywhere that has a break room, we've all experienced

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 this.

94
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 Food bandits.

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,200
 Human raccoons is what we call them.

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,960
 Those of us who don't indulge in this.

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,440
 You bring your lunch, you bring your food to work, you put it in the fridge, and then you

98
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,500
 go later to open it up and get your ham sandwich or whatever you bring in.

99
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
 And there's a bite taken out of it, or it's all gone.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,100
 I actually think finding it with a bite taken out of it is more insulting, because then someone

101
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,200
 took a bite out of your food and is so callous they could put it back in the bag.

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,720
 If you just go and it's missing, they're both idiotic, but if you go and it's missing,

103
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 then you think, "Oh man, someone ate my sandwich."

104
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,440
 But if someone took a bite out of it and put it back, it's kind of like you're spitting

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
 in your face.

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,120
 I have been the victim of human raccoons maybe twice in my life.

107
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
 It doesn't happen very often to me, but it has happened.

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,360
 And I know a lot of people it's happened to constantly.

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,120
 And the one, both times it happened to me, I was so furious, so mad.

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
 I was thinking of ways to booby trap food.

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,760
 I was like, "Oh, maybe I could not wash my hands."

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
 And I was like, "Well, Jason, you don't do that anyway.

113
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
 That's not a booby trap.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
 That's just normally you."

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,040
 But you think of ways to dirty the food, and then you realize that you could actually get

116
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,200
 in trouble for that if they get really sick, and you're like, "Ha ha!

117
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 I didn't wash my hands."

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,760
 And they're like, "Jason, you never wash your hands."

119
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,960
 I'm like, "But this day I was particularly messy."

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,080
 This story doesn't involve a human raccoon.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
 It involves something far more dangerous.

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,920
 So it's June, it's 2018.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,880
 We're in Germany.

124
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
 So you know I'm gonna butcher this name.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,680
 We're in the town of Schlossholt Stukenbrock.

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
 Actually, I think I got that right.

127
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,600
 Anyways, so we're in Germany.

128
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,960
 We're in this town.

129
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,760
 And this dude goes to eat his lunch, and he's like, looking around.

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,920
 He's like, "Good, no human raccoons have been here."

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,520
 But for whatever reason, before he eats a sandwich, he looks at it.

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
 Now I've never done that.

133
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,600
 I've never been like, "Mmm, time for a good meal.

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,120
 Time for me to turn this sandwich inside out and make sure no one's done anything to

135
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
 it."

136
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
 But for whatever reason, he gets a sandwich and he goes, "Hmm."

137
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,880
 And he lifts the top piece of bread off, and he notices there's something smeared, some

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,640
 sort of weird powdery substance smeared on his meat.

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
 And I'm gonna, no sex joke there.

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,920
 He notices there's something smeared on his meat, and he goes, "This is weird.

141
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,600
 I didn't put this on.

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,600
 I did not add any powder to any, any smellless, tasteless powder to my food.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 What is this?"

144
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,280
 So he goes to his boss, and he's like, "Hey man, there's this weird powder on my food,

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,720
 and I don't want to get too like crazy about it, but I didn't put this stuff on here."

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 I don't know what it is.

147
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,000
 And the boss goes, "Well, you know, we have video cameras in the break room, oddly enough,

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and the employee's like, 'What?

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 You're spying on us?'"

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
 And the boss is like, "No, no, no, no, no, just forget I said that.

151
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,320
 But I won't go into this room that has all these security monitors that aren't recording

152
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,880
 the break room, and I will then walk out with an answer of what happened in the break room.

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
 And as the employee stood there scratching his head, I don't know if that exchange actually

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
 happened.

155
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,480
 I don't know why my boss's video tape in the break room, but they watch the video footage,

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,200
 and they see another employee walk in, pull the dude's sandwich out, and start to sprinkle

157
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,240
 a powdery substance on the sandwich.

158
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,920
 And at that point, they're like, "What the hell is this?

159
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 What is this?

160
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,360
 We should figure out what he did."

161
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,320
 I guess there's a shorter way to say that, but...

162
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,360
 And the two guys are looking at each other, and they go, "What did he do?

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 What did he put on the sandwich?"

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,880
 So they must have been suspicious for some point, because at that point, if I had video

165
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,560
 of someone spreading stuff on my sandwich, I would go directly talk to the person and

166
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
 be like, "Yo, bro, what'd you do?"

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 But they actually had a toxicology report run on the sandwich.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
 And it came back.

169
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,800
 It was something called toxic acetate, acetate.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 Toxic acetate?

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 Acetate?

172
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 Anyways, the word toxic should be enough for you.

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,600
 Acetate is a tasteless, smellless, highly dangerous chemical that damages your organs.

174
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,000
 Now when I said they must have their suspicions about this, and that's why they had it tested,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,040
 there was a reason to be suspicious.

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,840
 At this place of business, 21 people died before they were supposed to retire.

177
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
 This wasn't a...

178
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,160
 They weren't police officers.

179
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,640
 This wasn't retire any.

180
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,920
 This was people just dying in this office building, dying before they were supposed to retire.

181
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
 They were older, but they were dying.

182
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,440
 Two employees in a coma, one awake, survived, but on dialysis for the rest of his life.

183
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
 So these people were suffering organ damage, and nobody could really figure it out.

184
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,640
 They figured, "Oh, maybe they just hold.

185
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,800
 That's what happens when you get old, your organs get damaged."

186
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,080
 This guy is currently being suspected of killing 21 people, of poisoning their food.

187
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,040
 And this one dude just happened... when's the last time you've ever opened up a sandwich

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 to check?

189
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
 I don't even do that in Subway.

190
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,600
 I don't even do that when strangers make my food.

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,400
 I guess you get to see them make your food, but they could always put something in the

192
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,880
 Chipotle Southwest salsa.

193
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 But you know what I mean?

194
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,080
 I don't even check food that strangers give me, let alone food I prepare myself.

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,160
 Bizarre story, but again, this just happened in June of 2018, so he hasn't been convicted

196
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 or anything like that.

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,200
 Hasn't even gone to trial, but we'll learn more.

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,960
 The next story we're going to talk about is another kind of short one.

199
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,520
 And this one is a very, very limited, bizarre disease.

200
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,400
 It's called visual release hallucinations.

201
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
 It affects two types of people.

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,120
 It affects people who have degeneration of their eyesight, so either it's called by diabetes

203
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
 or old age, or, I don't know, getting poked in the eye multiple times, but not going blind

204
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,600
 from the first time, it's just every single day a twig hits you in the eye.

205
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,480
 The other one is very specific.

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,160
 It's from something called methanol poisoning, which I never heard of, and it most likely

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,840
 happens from drinking windshield wiper fluid.

208
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:29,240
 Now I saw that, I go, "How many people are like, "Mmm, blue Gatorade glug glug?"

209
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
 No, that's Windex!

210
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,960
 But apparently, that's, it's not like in the top 10, but it's a more common than you

211
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,840
 would think way of killing yourself, drinking windshield wiper fluid.

212
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,800
 That's so specific that's not like drinking bleach or drinking ammonia or whatever.

213
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,440
 I mean, you kind of have to go out of your way to say, "Oh man, I just can't do it anymore.

214
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
 Where's the keys to the car?"

215
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,960
 And they're like, "No, no, no, don't breathe in carbon monoxide."

216
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
 No, what are you talking about?

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
 I'm not gonna do that.

218
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
 And then you're like drilling a hole.

219
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,160
 I hate to be making light of it, but that's such a specific thing.

220
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,480
 Like why would that be your go-to thing?

221
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,840
 But it happens, surprisingly, a lot.

222
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
 Drinking windshield wiper fluid.

223
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,920
 I didn't even know that stuff was toxic.

224
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
 I want to drink it, but I didn't know it could kill you.

225
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,960
 Anyways, so if you drink too much of this windshield wiper fluid or you just get poked

226
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,600
 in the eye multiple times or you just have diabetes, you can develop visual release hallucinations,

227
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,760
 or it's also known as the Charles Bonnet Syndrome.

228
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
 And this is what you do.

229
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,280
 It's basically, it's a set of hallucinations, but they're increasingly bizarre.

230
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,040
 The first thing is, is that you'll be sitting there and you'll see an inanimate object.

231
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,480
 So you'll just see like a stool in the corner.

232
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,280
 And you go, "That's weird.

233
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
 I don't own a stool."

234
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 And then it's like, "Meow."

235
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
 Disappears.

236
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,840
 And you're like, "Charles Bonnet, sometimes you'll see people."

237
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,640
 And I'm assuming they're not inanimate.

238
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,400
 I'm sure they're like walking by and they're like, "Hey guys, what's up?"

239
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 "Meow."

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 Disappearing.

241
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,720
 And you're like, "Ah, I guess I was hallucinating again."

242
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,320
 Animals, again, you see animals.

243
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,240
 Now what's weird is, those might, you might be really seeing real people and real animals.

244
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,560
 I don't know how you would differentiate those from hallucinations unless they evaporated

245
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,000
 or they're walking upside down or something like that.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,840
 But usually, I guess I should have read a little more of my notes because this explains

247
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,640
 why you know it's hallucination.

248
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,520
 Generally, you'll see them and they'll be tiny, tiny people.

249
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,960
 So, you know, like, go over, I'm not going to talk about go over, travel again, but like

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,800
 lily-pooshens, like little tiny people walking around, little tiny animals.

251
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,000
 Actually, okay, so if you took a six-foot person, my height, I'm a six-foot-five, but

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,160
 if you took a six-foot person and you made him tiny and now he's this tiny guy walking

253
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,080
 on your floor, if you took a cat, that's what, how tall are cats, half a foot, and you shrunk

254
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,960
 him down, would he be the scale work?

255
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,480
 So if you saw a tiny person who used to be six feet and now he's, I don't know, 10 inches,

256
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,080
 and then you took a half-foot cat, would he be also a 10-inch cat?

257
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,720
 Because it's all hallucinations.

258
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
 Or would he shrink down so he's the same tiny cat next to the person?

259
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 If there was no person there, would you just see, like, how cats are tiny anyways?

260
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,960
 But also, another weird thing is that in 1760, they were talking about this disease, they

261
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,040
 said, sometimes they were talking about the tiny people and then they said, quote, "physically

262
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,560
 impossible circumstances," unquote.

263
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,800
 Now in modern times, what people will see with Charles Bonnet syndrome is they will

264
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
 see cartoons.

265
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:43,080
 So like Mickey Mouse dancing in front of them, whistling, you know, on the steamboat, whatever.

266
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,440
 In 1760, would they have seen a cartoon?

267
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,840
 Do you have to see something for your hallucination to be based on?

268
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,880
 Would they see, like, wood carvings?

269
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,680
 Would they see, like, just a still image of a, that's kind of creepy.

270
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,960
 You're sitting in a room and you wake up and there's just, like, a still image of a wood

271
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,720
 carving man staring at you.

272
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,760
 But that's actually more creepy than the cartoon.

273
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,000
 But would they see, is it possible to hallucinate something that's based on nothing that you've

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,520
 ever seen?

275
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 Could somebody, if I was hallucinating, if I had this disease, I may see Optimus Prime

276
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 and Bumblebee run by in animated form.

277
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,360
 In 1760, I'm not saying they would see Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, but would they see a

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,560
 cartoon run by them even though they had no concept of what a cartoon was?

279
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,060
 How does that work?

280
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,200
 Are all of our hallucinations, I mean, I know you can hallucinate fractals and stuff like

281
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,120
 that, but that's more of like a mathematical scientific thing?

282
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
 And you could say, well, I've never seen a fractal before, but once I started hallucinating

283
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
 I started tripping out and seeing all this crazy stuff.

284
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,480
 But could you hallucinate something that you had never, ever seen before?

285
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,960
 Not like an eight-headed dragon, but I mean like the style, could someone in 1760 hallucinate

286
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:06,880
 a Rob Liefield type drawing, even though they had no idea of what that would look like?

287
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,880
 They had no idea of cartoon or comic books or animation or anything like that.

288
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,400
 Could they hallucinate that?

289
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,720
 I don't know.

290
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,520
 Because if humans can create animation, then the animation is something...

291
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,920
 If humans can create something, then that means the human mind is capable of expressing

292
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
 it?

293
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
 I don't know.

294
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,800
 I mean, does a baby...

295
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
 Would a baby know what a cartoon...

296
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,440
 Could a baby hallucinate a cartoon without ever seeing a cartoon?

297
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,520
 Because when it sees a cartoon, it understands what it is.

298
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,600
 Therefore, the brain is capable of processing it.

299
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,440
 Therefore, the brain should be able to create it itself without having ever seen it in the

300
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
 first place.

301
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,080
 Does that make sense?

302
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 I just...

303
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,800
 When I read that, I thought, "That would be crazy."

304
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 I mean, think about it.

305
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,200
 You already think you're going crazy.

306
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,520
 You see your uncle and your dog, they're like ten inches tall, they're walking through the

307
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,040
 grass and you're like, "Oh, I must be going crazy."

308
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,160
 And then you turn around the corner and you see Donald Duck playing a xylophone and you

309
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,840
 be like, "I have no frame of reference for that whatsoever.

310
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,880
 I've never seen 2D animation before and here's this guy dancing around."

311
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,080
 So it's super bizarre.

312
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
 I don't know, but it would fit.

313
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,880
 That would be physically impossible circumstances if someone was like, "No, there was a duck

314
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,200
 and a mouse and a dog, but it didn't look like a dog.

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,720
 It was tall, but then there was an actual dog there and the guy's doctor's like, "Dude,

316
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,040
 dude, dude, just here.

317
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,320
 I'm going to size you for a straight jacket and just move on from here."

318
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,640
 So I don't know.

319
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,320
 Sometimes it's just a flash of an image.

320
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,880
 Sometimes it lasts all day long.

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,960
 And watching a Mickey Mouse cartoon for 24 hours sounds...

322
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,000
 I would just put my eyes out at that point.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,160
 That sounds like the worst torture possible.

324
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
 Sorry, Mickey.

325
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,600
 You were the boringest cartoon.

326
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,640
 I'd rather watch Huckleberry Hound or something like that and that was...

327
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
 Ugh, that was terrible too.

328
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,280
 Okay, so our last story.

329
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,960
 Now this one I'm putting out there with a caveat.

330
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,440
 I have absolutely no proof of any of this at all.

331
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,120
 This is something that has been like a half conspiracy theory, half really cool story

332
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,320
 idea that's been cooking in my mind for a long time.

333
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,880
 I'm always a little more nervous when I put out episodes where I'm like, "There's no

334
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,280
 proof of this conspiracy theory, not because I just think it's gibberish, but because I

335
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,480
 always worry that it's actually true and the reason why there's no proof of it, because

336
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,160
 everyone who tries to talk about it ends up getting shot."

337
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,040
 But I remember when this happened, I thought, "This is really bizarre that they're really

338
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,920
 concerned about this."

339
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:46,720
 So back in 2009, the governments of the world, the United Nations was involved in this, said,

340
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,360
 "We're going to move away from analog television and we're going to move to digital television.

341
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,200
 We're going to do everything digital."

342
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,640
 And the US government had a program where they actually gave people money to buy a digital

343
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
 converter.

344
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,360
 I remember when it was going on and everyone was getting their vouchers and stuff like that

345
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,480
 and I thought, "Why does the government care how good our broadcast signal is?

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,000
 Why is the government actually giving its citizens money to buy a digital converter box?"

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,080
 Now the reason why we switched from analog to digital, the official reason is twofold.

348
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,600
 One, it's for better picture quality and sound and channels could broadcast more programming

349
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
 on a single channel.

350
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,120
 So you can have channel three and then channel 3.1 and 3.2 and all that.

351
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,240
 And the other thing is they wanted to free up the analog airwaves for emergency personnel

352
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,000
 and nobody questioned that.

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,280
 And again, this was a worldwide shift.

354
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,360
 The United Nations said, "We need to have everyone over to digital by this date and

355
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,680
 countries all over the world switch to it."

356
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,920
 Not all of them, some of them it was a phase in, but why did the United Nations care about

357
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,800
 the analog signal?

358
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,480
 Because the jamming up too much so a cop couldn't pick up their radio and say, "I need backup,

359
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,240
 I need backup," and instead like reruns of "Welcome back, Cota!" are playing on it, it

360
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
 didn't make sense to me.

361
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,640
 It still doesn't make sense to me.

362
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,240
 But here is my conspiracy theory.

363
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,720
 Again, no proof to back this up, but it's just a hunch.

364
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,760
 It's a fanciful hunch.

365
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,360
 Whenever it shows a broadcast in analog form, they leave, they're basically bounced, they're

366
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,240
 basically broadcast as like a circle and they spread out.

367
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,080
 Now low power broadcasts cannot penetrate the ionosphere of the Earth and they just stay

368
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,160
 trapped here.

369
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,960
 But high powered broadcasts can leave the ionosphere of Earth and then they move through

370
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,080
 space at the speed of light.

371
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,800
 There's actually a really cool website, I'll link in the show notes, where you can see

372
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,560
 like on this day what star system would be, what show this particular star system would

373
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,840
 be receiving today.

374
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,480
 And it's kind of guesswork.

375
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,080
 But they're saying a star 44 light years out right now would be watching something that

376
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,600
 happened 44 years ago and they'll show you a little YouTube clip.

377
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,800
 It's just kind of a neat novelty website.

378
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,680
 Because once it leaves the atmosphere, it's moving at the speed of light.

379
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,080
 The first most powerful broadcast to leave Earth would have been, well according to Carl

380
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,920
 Sagan, it was the Nuremberg rallies, Hitler's Nuremberg rallies, but that's actually not

381
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,200
 true.

382
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,720
 It was Hitler, it was still Hitler, but it was at the 1939 Olympic Games.

383
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,360
 I think it was 1939, it doesn't matter.

384
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
 It was at the Olympic Games.

385
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,560
 Do they have Olympic Games in odd years?

386
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,960
 I think they're, so whatever, 1938.

387
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,800
 The point is, Hitler was the first thing to be broadcast that escaped the atmosphere

388
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,200
 and went into space.

389
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,160
 But right now, let's see, if we went 50 years back, that would put us around, you're like

390
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,040
 Jason, don't do math right now, that put us somewhere around 1968, somewhere around there.

391
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,680
 So they'd be watching footage of American Vietnam and stuff like that if they were 50

392
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
 light years out.

393
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,480
 The question is, really they say the thing is, the way that our transmissions are based

394
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,360
 is because they're that circle, that "wum, wum, wum" and not a direct beam.

395
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,400
 Even if they do get 50 light years out and picked up by something, it'll be very diffuse.

396
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,600
 It'll be very hard to separate from background information.

397
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:30,360
 Now we've tried to make a beam of information, the SETI, the search for extraterrestrial,

398
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 whatever.

399
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,680
 They look for aliens.

400
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:40,800
 They wanted to make a beam, a super powerful beam and they shot it up out of the atmosphere.

401
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,680
 And they said this way it won't diffuse over the light years.

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,120
 But if they want to watch the video footage of it, the aliens are going to need an array

403
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,520
 that's 7 miles wide.

404
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,120
 And if they just wanted the audio, because audio tends to lose itself more, or if they

405
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,520
 want to watch the video with the audio, they would need an array that was 500 miles wide.

406
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,400
 So even with this super concise beam, it would be really hard to pick up.

407
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,880
 So our "I love Lucy" episodes, really they don't have a chance of being picked up.

408
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,360
 So the first theory that I had was that the reason why I switched to analog and digital

409
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,560
 was basically to go black, to go dark.

410
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,680
 Cable doesn't send out the signals, streaming doesn't send out the signals, internet doesn't

411
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
 send out the signals.

412
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,560
 It's just these big, high powerful broadcasting analog towers that would.

413
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,120
 And so if the government said, "Listen, we're letting everyone know where we're at.

414
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,280
 And we're just sending out wave after wave after wave of information of where we're at."

415
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:52,280
 And it would be equivalent of you're basically hiding in a forest from a bunch of predators.

416
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,640
 You're lost in a dark forest surrounded by wolves.

417
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,160
 And you don't know where the wolves are, and they don't know where you are.

418
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,840
 And then you break out your boombox and start playing Steve Winwood top volume.

419
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
 And now they know where you're at.

420
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,600
 And you still don't know where they are.

421
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,640
 Until it's too late.

422
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,320
 They're too close.

423
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,080
 So the first idea was they hid that.

424
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
 That we're going to go dark.

425
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,840
 And then you would have to roll into that, that all of this SETI building the beam and

426
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 stuff like that.

427
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 That's all fake.

428
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,320
 They didn't really do that.

429
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,680
 The reason why that theory didn't necessarily wash with me is because we have, I mean, assuming

430
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,760
 that NAS is not totally lying to us and all that stuff, we've sent out satellites, we've

431
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
 sent out voyagers, SETIs doing their thing and stuff like that.

432
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,000
 But what if the reason why we switched to digital television is to not hide ourselves

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,360
 from some other race out there, but to hide them from us?

434
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,400
 Because it would work both ways.

435
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,480
 If a broadcast signal was headed towards Earth, the analog stations could pick it up now.

436
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,560
 And I did earlier say you would need a concentrated beam and a receiving array that's, you know,

437
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,120
 5 to 500 miles long, 7 to 500 miles long, whatever it was.

438
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,480
 But and that's based on our technology.

439
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,640
 But what if their technology that's broadcasting is far more powerful and it could be picked

440
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,040
 up by your local neighborhood antenna?

441
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,860
 They're broadcasting an analog signal.

442
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,800
 They haven't moved to digital and we've detected it coming towards this planet.

443
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,360
 And the step was, was the United Nations saying, listen, there's one or two things that are

444
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,800
 going to happen.

445
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,560
 One day people around the world are going to turn on their televisions and they're

446
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:39,440
 going to begin receiving these transmissions from an alien race or we just take all of

447
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,600
 our analog towers offline and everyone has to do digital.

448
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,240
 So those waves just pass right through the planet and we never know that they came.

449
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,280
 Now there are still low power analog antennas in some countries.

450
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,840
 There are still things like ham radio operators, CB radios and things like that.

451
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:07,480
 But there's a big difference between having say 5 billion people watching a signal and

452
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,640
 1% of them actually getting enough clarity of what the image looks like to be able to

453
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,800
 make a determination like something's really wrong here versus 500 million people on their

454
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,520
 ham radios, low power antennas, CB radios, what have you and 1% of them picking up that

455
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 signal.

456
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
 It's a lot easier to hide if you just say, oh no, no, no, that was just some glitch.

457
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,360
 But if some guy's just working on his ham radio and one day he picks up blah, blah,

458
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,920
 blah, blah, blah, blah, he may log into something weird, he may record it, but that's a lot easier

459
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,680
 to dispute than the population of the world picking that up.

460
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
 Because here's the thing.

461
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,080
 When we talk about aliens, we imagine them to be, you know, you have the fictional aliens

462
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,920
 where they have their ships, they fly around, they blow stuff up.

463
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,560
 And then you have the aliens that people say exist like gray aliens or reptilians or the

464
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,080
 blonde white people, what are they called?

465
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,840
 Illuminarians or something?

466
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,340
 The Pleidians.

467
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,360
 And they seem to be, like the reptilians are supposedly evil, but it's a very like antiseptic

468
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
 evil.

469
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,240
 It's a very like human evil.

470
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,480
 But imagine getting a broadcast from an alien planet.

471
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,320
 We think, imagine if an alien planet saw the Nuremberg rallies or an alien planet saw

472
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,120
 news footage of the Vietnam War.

473
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:34,440
 Could you even imagine the horrors that could come from an alien planet of their broadcast?

474
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,120
 We always see the grays as kind of like just walking around the ship kind of tooling around

475
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 with instruments or the reptilians kind of like V where they're kind of like this regal

476
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
 enemy that eat people, but then they also like walk on two legs and stuff like that

477
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,080
 and they shape shifts and all that type of stuff.

478
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,280
 But what if we saw a television broadcast, a true television broadcast from an alien

479
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,520
 planet?

480
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:05,720
 What type of evil and filth and truly like it's alien, our brains, even a reptilian is

481
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,080
 familiar to us.

482
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,800
 But something from another planet that is evolved along a completely different path

483
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,760
 that shares none of our DNA, just like I was talking about on the previous segment, can

484
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,680
 you imagine something that you can't imagine, that you have no concept for?

485
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,800
 That's what it would be like to see an alien broadcast.

486
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:35,200
 Would we even be able to recognize things like individuals in a crowd, some sort of

487
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,280
 narrative, some sort of character?

488
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 We wouldn't.

489
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,880
 You would see an alien broadcast and it would just fill you with revulsion because it is

490
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,240
 something that is so unnatural for a human to see.

491
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,740
 You can show me a video of grays dissecting a human being.

492
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,600
 You can show me a video of a reptilian eating somebody.

493
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,840
 Those are still familiar things because I've seen things being devoured and I've seen

494
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,040
 dissections in the science class.

495
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:12,600
 But imagine seeing something alien, doing something alien to another alien thing.

496
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,400
 It would be the definition of HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu level horror.

497
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:27,880
 Even if on their planet it was something completely mundane, to us it would be so disturbing.

498
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,040
 On their planet it could be the equivalent of a sitcom, but to us we would see nothing

499
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,800
 but pure horror in it.

500
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,680
 Because what we're experiencing, what we're seeing and hearing is truly incomprehensible

501
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 to us.

502
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:49,120
 It is on another planet with another life form, another culture, another language, another

503
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,280
 I mean you could go there's you couldn't you could you even see that they were talking

504
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:04,840
 to each other or would it just be horror upon horror upon horror imagery and sound

505
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,600
 that was coming from this alien planet.

506
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,240
 Whether or not they would ever reach us wouldn't matter.

507
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,120
 But if we got this alien broadcast and we saw these incomprehensible inhuman things

508
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,040
 it would fill us with such dread we would never want to go out.

509
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,360
 We would never want to see what's out there.

510
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,080
 Because we would know that the universe isn't full of life like us with two arms and two

511
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,960
 legs and brains and eyes and they have power struggles and they're fighting for control

512
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,800
 of earth and the reptilians are over here and the greys are here and the conformers are

513
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,280
 here and the pleiadians are here and they have these structures you have the Starship

514
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,480
 Athena you have all this stuff 2012 Antarctica ice bases all these things are human concepts.

515
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,560
 We see the universe in a very Star Trek Star Wars type of way where you could go to a bar

516
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,960
 and sit next to an alien and not throw up because he's so gross and the smell of him

517
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,400
 is so toxic because he has a different evolutionary path on a different planet that you've never

518
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,660
 been to.

519
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,200
 We see it I'll be like hey Spock Spock would stink like a mofo Spock would be the most

520
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,600
 disgusting person you could well maybe not Spock because he's half human but you know

521
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,400
 what I mean like you would have these well you wouldn't be able to bang another alien

522
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,960
 but you would have these huge differences it's just like we do it here when we build

523
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,480
 a robot that looks too human or we make CGI that looks too human it's called the uncanny

524
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:43,680
 valley it makes us sick times that by a thousand and you have what it would be like to look

525
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,240
 at an alien broadcast.

526
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,400
 So is that why we went dark not to hide us from them but to hide them from us because

527
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:59,280
 if we knew what was truly out there in the darkness of space forget the probes forget

528
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,160
 SETI forget sending these messages of recordings of Beethoven and pictures of a man and a woman

529
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:13,460
 that would all be done in an instant and humanity would be that kid in a forest surrounded by

530
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:21,040
 wolves and just trying to close their eyes and hope that they are never found.

531
