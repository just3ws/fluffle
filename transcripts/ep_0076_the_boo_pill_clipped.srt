1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 In the country of Chile, a small Bavarian village hides dark secrets.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:18,000
 And can you use technology to prove the existence of ghosts today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,280
 I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,280
 It's October 2nd.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,080
 We're moving along with Spooky October Month.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,760
 And you know, I got a little heated during yesterday's episode.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,120
 I was listening back to it and God man, I got mad.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,840
 I was like, I need to recalibrate.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 I need to pick some funner stories for the next one because yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,760
 I just kind of started to get really upset.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 So I'm happy with that.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,920
 Oh, and I have to say that yes, I've talked a lot about my music.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
 That was one of the songs.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,920
 That song, Dead World, is about 10 years old.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,760
 I recorded that probably back in 2009.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,760
 The audio samples are from Dawn of the Dead.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,000
 But I really liked that song and I figured it was a good way to start off Halloween month.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,920
 I hope you guys enjoyed it as well.

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,880
 I do want to start this episode off with an actual email.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,040
 This is an Alicenor mail segment.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,200
 This is an actual email I got from someone named Josh and it was in reference to meth

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
 immortality.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,920
 He had another theory on the whole idea of, you know, I said the conspiracy theory of

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,840
 meth immortality is if you charge the crystals, it can give you healing power or whatever

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
 it was.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,160
 It was, you know, I don't, again, I have to keep saying this.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,800
 I don't believe you can actually charge your meth crystals with healing energy.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
 But this is what this young man wrote.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,440
 As a final note, I enjoyed your podcast on meth immortality, but I wanted to tell you

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,720
 about another variation of that myth that I heard, except it was about heroin and not

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
 meth.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,960
 I'm paraphrasing from memory here, but the general idea is this.

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,920
 When people get old and die of natural causes, they die because they don't really have a

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,840
 strong motivation or reason to live anymore.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
 There's nothing that's requiring them to stay alive.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
 They're generally at peace or so taken by dementia that they're not really even aware

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
 of what's going on anymore.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,480
 Heroin, as the rumor goes, gives the body a strong reason to keep going because the

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
 need to satiate itself on the drug is that strong.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,600
 I understand that Philip Seymour Hoffman, before he died, may have bought into this myth.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Apparently, quite a few heroin addicts think that heroin actually makes them live longer.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,200
 They believe that the need for it is so strong that it can actually ward off death, maybe

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,320
 not forever, but at least for a while.

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,120
 I think it's a variation of another myth where some men, when they stop working, die

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
 shortly after.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,960
 Again, the theme here is that the people who don't have anything to live for don't live

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,360
 much longer than their purpose.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
 So I wanted to share that with you guys.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,480
 I think that actually is a very valid alternative theory to meth immortality, where that conspiracy

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,520
 could have come from.

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,440
 That, like he said, the need for the drug keeps the body alive to get more of the drug.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 So thanks, Josh.

56
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,800
 Thanks for that email and for that alternative theory.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,240
 Now, I want to start the episode off with the story of Colonia Dignidad.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:29,360
 Now, quite possible that I'm mispronouncing that, but it's basically like Dignity Colony.

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,000
 It is in Chile, in the South American country of Chile, there is a Bavarian town with all

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,560
 of the trappings, like the little roofs and I don't know the gingerbread walls and the

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,080
 women wear the traditional dresses, the men wear the traditional garb and it almost looked

62
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,880
 like you were walking through the jungle and then you stumbled upon this German town.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
 And it's a real place.

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,480
 This isn't like the Invisible City or Dublin, Wisconsin.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 It's still there.

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,920
 You can actually visit it today.

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
 What makes it interesting, other than the fact that it seems like an entire town was

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,160
 teleported from one part of the globe to the other, is why it was founded and who founded

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
 it.

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,400
 Back in the 1960s, it was founded and it was founded by a guy named Peter Schaefer.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,200
 He was a German citizen who fought during World War II.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,560
 Well, he didn't really fight during World War II.

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,460
 He wanted to fight during World War II for the German government.

74
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,320
 He wanted to become a member of the SS with the Nazis.

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
 One problem though, he was missing one of his eyeballs.

76
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,880
 Now, after the war, he told people, "I lost my eye because I did serve.

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,400
 I lost my eye in battle."

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,320
 What really happened was when he was a kid, his shoelaces were tied so tight that he got

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,480
 a fork to like wedge into the shoelace to force it out.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,120
 And he pulled on it so hard it slipped and he stuck himself in his own eyeball, lost

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
 the eye.

82
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,840
 I would tell people I lost it in the war too.

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,960
 When you tell them I lost it for the Allies rather than the Axis, but you have to deal

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,760
 the cards you're dealt.

85
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,680
 So after the war that he didn't fight in, he began kind of like getting into ministry

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,160
 youth group stuff.

87
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
 And that didn't go so well.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,280
 There were some complications there.

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
 And then he decided, "You know what?

90
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,160
 I'm going to just be like a traveling minister."

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,560
 And he started to gather up this following.

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
 He's a very charismatic person even though he's missing an eye.

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,160
 He had a glass eye.

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,960
 I don't know why this thing and I would make you less charismatic, but he had a glass eye.

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,360
 He was, I'm really fixated on the eye just because the way he lost it.

96
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
 But so anyways, he's going around.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
 He's kind of walking from town to town.

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,160
 He gets this gathering of people and he says, "You know what, followers?

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,600
 We need to go to a country and start our own town."

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,480
 It has nothing to do with the allegations that happened at my previous church or the

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,880
 allegations that are happening now.

102
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
 Let's go to Chile and form a new town.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,320
 Now his people were enthralled with him.

104
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,520
 They said like, he basically like when he spoke, he just gave you such light and such

105
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
 hope.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,120
 So he packs up his followers.

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,920
 I think there's like 250 of them.

108
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,840
 They go to Chile and they form this town, colonial dignidad.

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,360
 Let's jump ahead a little bit a couple of years here.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,520
 And I want you to get a view of what Paul Schaefer was like.

111
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,960
 And also wasn't Paul Schaefer, I must have been pronouncing his name wrong because I'm

112
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,280
 pretty sure Paul Schaefer was the band leader from the David Letterman show.

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,000
 But no, his name actually is Paul Schaefer.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So hey, so this is a, I'm just jumping in real quick.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,280
 His name is not Paul Schaefer.

116
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,920
 It's Peter Schaefer.

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,000
 I said some point in the episode, started calling him Paul Schaefer.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,600
 It's not Paul, it's Peter, but it's just way too much trouble to re-hear the episode.

119
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,080
 So you're just going to have to imagine the band leader from the David Letterman show

120
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,040
 committing the atrocities that are going to unfold the rest of this episode.

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
 Enjoy.

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,880
 Okay, actually, I just looked it up.

123
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
 His name is Paul Schaefer.

124
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,440
 I referred to him earlier erroneously as Peter Schaefer.

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,040
 Peter Schaefer is a Jewish scholar who I've now labeled as a man who not only fought for

126
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,480
 the Nazis, but poked his own eyeball out with a fork.

127
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,720
 I had notes for this episode.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,440
 I had highly detailed notes for this episode.

129
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,960
 Sorry, Peter.

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
 The episode will continue.

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,600
 Paul Schaefer takes everyone over to Chile.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,040
 Now we're going to jump ahead a couple of years, because I think this story kind of

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,200
 sums it up.

134
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,040
 The kids of the little village love two things.

135
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,240
 Their spiritual leader, Paul Schaefer, and Santa Claus, because what kid doesn't love

136
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,320
 Santa Claus?

137
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,280
 So one day, like a day or two before Christmas, Paul Schaefer gathers up all the kids from

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,240
 the colony and says, "We are going to go see Santa Claus."

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
 So they're like, "Oh, right.

140
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 We're going to go see Santa Claus."

141
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,920
 And they walk with their spiritual leader, like the leader of their town.

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,160
 He's the everything to them.

143
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,920
 The only person more important in the world than Santa Claus, and they walk down to the

144
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,120
 river.

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,280
 And Paul Schaefer goes, "Look.

146
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,360
 Look, look, kids.

147
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
 There he is."

148
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,880
 I'm assuming he's saying it in German, but there's like a raft coming down the river,

149
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 and it's Santa Claus.

150
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,920
 Santa full red suit, white beard, hat is coming in a raft down the river, and the kids are

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
 like, "Oh my God."

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,880
 They start cheering.

153
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,160
 Paul Schaefer then pulls a gun out of his pocket and shoots Santa Claus, who then tumbles

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,720
 into the raging rapids and disappears.

155
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,520
 From then on, only Paul Schaefer's birthday was celebrated in the town.

156
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
 It was the only holiday.

157
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,960
 Now, just I got to let you guys know, Santa Claus didn't actually die.

158
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,400
 He had another member of his group, another adult, say, "Hey, I'm going to shoot at you.

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,920
 I just want you to jump into the river and pretend that their childhood hero is dying."

160
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 And the guys are like, "Yeah, sure.

161
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
 No problem."

162
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,520
 But basically they saw their spiritual leader kill Santa Claus.

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,400
 He had, Paul Schaefer was basically a control freak.

164
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,320
 He had, it was this religious cult that he had founded.

165
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
 And again, people never really think it's a cult when they start it.

166
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 But he encouraged people to spy on each other, which is a sign of a cult.

167
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,720
 He limited their sexual activities, which is a big sign of a cult.

168
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,040
 If you wanted to get married, you had to get his permission.

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
 And the guy would come up and say, "You know, I'm really in love with Sally down at the

170
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,000
 mill.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,840
 Can you do I have permission to marry her?"

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
 And Paul Schaefer would go, "You have permission to marry Debbie."

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,800
 And Debbie is 80 years old.

174
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,880
 So if you want to get married, that's the only woman you can marry.

175
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
 And so the guy would be like, "Ugh."

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,560
 He would choose who you could end up with and he would be a dick about it.

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,360
 He would not give you the person that you wanted.

178
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
 Now they supported themselves because they had like mills and they made like traditional

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,440
 Bavarian foods and they sold it to local towns.

180
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,800
 They also had a world class or I should say a first class hospital in their town.

181
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,560
 And they got state subsidies from the government of Chile because they treated the people,

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
 the poor people who lived around the colony.

183
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
 The poor people loved the place.

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,160
 They're like, "Oh, these super nice Germans are here."

185
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,400
 And Chile and Germany actually had really close ties throughout the war and beyond.

186
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,180
 But rumors started to leak out.

187
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,480
 People started to escape.

188
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,080
 And as his name was getting linked to this group, the allegations that drove him from

189
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,120
 the church that drove him from Germany spring back up.

190
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,880
 He's a child molester.

191
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,120
 So when he first, after the war, when he started, when he got with the church and was like a

192
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,380
 youth minister type of thing, he was molesting boys.

193
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,800
 So they kicked him out.

194
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
 And then he went from town to town and built up his own congregation.

195
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,280
 And during that time, allegations of him molesting boys were popping up and he's like, "I got

196
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
 to get out of the country."

197
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
 So he goes to Chile.

198
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,240
 Now he doesn't change his ways over there.

199
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,320
 He's in his own compound and local boys as well would come there because the boys would

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,480
 come there to learn this great education from the Germans.

201
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,840
 They'd come there to go to the hospital.

202
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 He would molest them.

203
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,200
 He had his own team of young men.

204
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
 He called sprinters.

205
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,200
 Their job was to run from one end of the...

206
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,800
 It was like 4,000 acres or something, or maybe 400 acres.

207
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,760
 I know that's a big difference, but it was this massive area, miles and miles and miles

208
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560
 of land they had bought.

209
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,600
 Oh, let me say, those kids, those sprinters that he was having run from one end of the

210
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,160
 compound to one other, he said, "You guys are the most important part of this.

211
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,640
 You guys are my communication network.

212
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 Why don't you sleep in my bedroom?"

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,320
 They would be like, "Yes, that's totally awesome."

214
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
 And then he'd molest them.

215
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
 He's just a monster overall.

216
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,760
 So you go with all these allegations, how come he wasn't shut down?

217
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,080
 Well, this is where things get dark.

218
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,480
 So despite everything that's happened before, the reason why he didn't get shut down was

219
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,200
 because he became fast allies with the new leader of the country, Augusta Pinochet.

220
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,400
 So in 1973, there was this junta, this military takeover of the country, and Pinochet, who's

221
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,480
 a world class, basically, like he's named synonymous with war crimes and disappearances

222
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,820
 and things like that, a brutal police state.

223
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,360
 He all of a sudden, Pinochet takes over and he's completely paranoid that he's going to

224
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
 be overthrown himself.

225
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,840
 They start mass disappearances, mass cases of torture.

226
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,480
 We still don't really know the full extent of it.

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,760
 And when he takes over, Schaefer basically says, "Hey, you me, me you.

228
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,200
 You need people to disappear and be tortured.

229
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,080
 I have a place in the middle of nowhere we can do that."

230
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 So people just started getting shipped out to colonial Dignidad.

231
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,120
 And to this day, we don't know how many people were tortured and murdered there.

232
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,760
 We have accounts of people who were taking there and tortured, and then they were said,

233
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,520
 "Oh, you're innocent or whatever."

234
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,880
 And they let them go.

235
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,000
 To this day, they're still looking for mass graves or really any graves.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,480
 This all went on for years and years and years.

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,800
 And the people at the colony were, it's a cult, so they really didn't care.

238
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,720
 They'd see trucks of people come out and go into these underground, because the whole

239
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,040
 place had like a web of underground tunnels.

240
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,680
 Sometimes they'd come out, sometimes they wouldn't.

241
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
 What do you care?

242
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
 Your spiritual leader is telling you it's okay.

243
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,720
 So this started in 1961.

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,040
 The revolution took place in 1973.

245
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,000
 In 1996, finally, you had the changeover.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,960
 Pinochet's gone.

247
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,800
 The allegations of the child molestation are finally reaching the right people, because

248
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,200
 they saw this guy, Schaefer, was an ally of Pinochet.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,760
 Now Pinochet's gone.

250
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
 Now the people are going to retaliate.

251
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
 They find out about Paul Schaefer.

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
 They find out about the allegations.

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,040
 They find out about the torture.

254
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,160
 The head police chief of the country was Luis Henriquez.

255
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,480
 He says, "I'm going to take down Paul Schaefer."

256
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
 They show up.

257
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 He's not there.

258
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,440
 Everyone's like, "Oh, he left a while ago."

259
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,680
 They do that 30 more times.

260
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,880
 Daytime raids, nighttime raids.

261
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,040
 Henriquez said, "I think at some point we missed him by a matter of seconds."

262
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,720
 He goes, "I think he was disappearing into the tunnel network, but they can never find

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 him."

264
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,360
 They would just show up out of the blue, search the whole place.

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,760
 At one point, Henriquez said, "We knew that he had left the country, but we kept doing

266
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,840
 raids because we wanted to gather more evidence to when we caught him to finally prosecute

267
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
 him."

268
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,880
 They would go in and they'd be like, "He's not here."

269
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,200
 The cops would know he wasn't there, but they still wanted to go through the tunnels

270
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,560
 and find bones and do some forensic stuff.

271
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,280
 Finally in the end, Paul Schaefer is an old man, old, old man.

272
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,640
 I believe they caught him in Brazil, him and some of his top lieutenants.

273
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,280
 They'd make down his door where he was sleeping and they arrested him.

274
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,240
 He was just this frail old man, could barely comprehend what was going on.

275
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,480
 Then he died in prison, which is fitting considering all the people that he tortured.

276
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,720
 Now, the colony is still there.

277
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,800
 The people who founded it still live there.

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,520
 It's a tourist attraction.

279
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,680
 They're actually trying to build a main road from, because it used to just be like a private

280
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
 road that led up to it.

281
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,440
 They're trying to build a main road that you can take to come visit this beautiful, peaceful,

282
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,920
 Bavarian city that may or may not have mass graves everywhere.

283
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,560
 You could show up and have this German pie and go to Oktoberfest as forensic detectives

284
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,800
 are like, "Excuse me, sir."

285
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,000
 They're like, "Have cadaver seeking dogs."

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
 It's bizarre.

287
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,720
 So yeah, colonial dignidad.

288
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
 There's a great article I'm linking in here.

289
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,440
 I got most of my info from one article.

290
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
 It's a great read.

291
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
 There's a bunch of stuff I left out.

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,080
 I really highly recommend reading it.

293
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,200
 The next story we're going to talk about here is one of particular interests of mine.

294
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,480
 So we talk about ghosts, talk about paranormal activity.

295
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,240
 And there are some people who are just like, "I saw a ghost walking down the street."

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,920
 Or I opened my closet and there was a ghost there.

297
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,360
 And people go, "Oh, I believe that."

298
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,160
 And then there are people who are like, "I'm a medium and I can sense the spirits."

299
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,720
 And I feel cold all of a sudden.

300
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,960
 There's an evil spirit near me.

301
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,400
 And people go, "Oh, I believe that."

302
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,960
 And then there are people who go, "Oh, listen, I have this electronic device called a spirit

303
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,760
 box and it randomly chooses radio stations and it allows ghosts to talk to us."

304
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,720
 And people go, "I believe that."

305
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,440
 Now generally the person who will believe in the spirit box is the person who will believe

306
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,160
 in any of it.

307
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 Same thing with the medium.

308
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,880
 If you believe that mediums can talk to ghosts, you automatically assume ghosts exist.

309
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,320
 So in that spectrum of people who enjoy paranormal, who believe that it exists, it doesn't matter

310
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,820
 what sort of...

311
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,480
 If someone's telling you a story that they saw a ghost, you will believe it.

312
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,080
 If someone's telling you, "I have rigorously built this scientific device to detect ghosts,"

313
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,720
 you'll believe it anyways.

314
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,080
 What I think is weird is that the scientific detection part is almost trying to be set up

315
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
 to convince skeptics.

316
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,240
 Like, "Look at this device I built.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
 This has wires and batteries and a little display.

318
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,840
 Ergo, you should believe this, skeptic.

319
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,480
 How can I fake this EMF reading?

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,840
 How can I fake this connect video display thing?

321
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 I can't.

322
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,800
 Therefore, you should believe it."

323
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,120
 I'm intrigued by the idea of EVPs.

324
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,000
 I've never heard one that I have felt was convincing in any way, shape, or form, ever.

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,520
 I've never heard an EVP where I haven't thought, "I'm only hearing it because I know what it's

326
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,400
 supposed to say," or that is very, very clearly not someone in the room.

327
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,960
 I think a lot of EVPs are faked, but the ones that aren't faked are just, you know,

328
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
 they walk into a room and they're like, "Who are you?

329
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
 Who are you?"

330
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
 And they'll be like, "Down here.

331
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
 Down here."

332
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,480
 And they'll be like, "Brown hair?"

333
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,440
 She says she had brown hair.

334
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,800
 And I'm like, "No, I was saying down here."

335
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,880
 But it doesn't matter because if anyone gives you the answer to what it's supposed to be,

336
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,120
 that's all you're here after it.

337
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,920
 I don't understand the point of EVPs.

338
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,280
 It almost feels to me like it's two things.

339
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,560
 One, people who—okay, let me back up here a second.

340
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,040
 Let's say that you do believe in the paranormal and you do believe there's mediums, but you

341
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,400
 know for sure you're not a medium, so you want to be part of the action.

342
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,200
 So you invent a device or you reconfigure an existing device, so you have the same abilities

343
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,520
 of a medium.

344
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,400
 I personally think mediums are frauds.

345
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,280
 I think it's a total fraud.

346
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,200
 So if somebody is saying, "I can speak to ghosts when I put my hands to my head and

347
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,960
 I roll my eyes back and all that stuff," I can talk to a ghost.

348
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,040
 I'm going to think right off the bat.

349
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,520
 If you're taking money for it in any way, shape, or form, you're a fraud.

350
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 Absolutely.

351
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,960
 So I don't have a reason to say I want to build a box for me to also commit fraud.

352
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
 Does that make sense?

353
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,440
 Like, because I don't believe in that particular superpower, I don't feel left out.

354
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,960
 But let's say you did believe that that was an actual superpower, that they're Spider-Man.

355
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,000
 You want to be Iron Man.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,160
 You want to build your suit.

357
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,640
 You want to use your technology to copy their skill.

358
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,800
 But I also, so that's part of it, but again, I think that the reason why people are so

359
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,520
 intent on proving that ghosts exist, because see, someone telling you a ghost story is

360
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
 not proof that ghosts exist.

361
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,040
 That's proof that somebody experienced something that they can't explain or they made it up.

362
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,160
 A medium saying, "I feel cold.

363
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,240
 I feel soft fingertips against my neck."

364
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,280
 Again, that's either you are having some sort of sensation that I can't explain or you're

365
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,520
 making it up.

366
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,600
 But when you have an EVP device, when you have a recording of a voice, they hit play

367
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,160
 and they go, "I didn't make...

368
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,360
 It was only me in the room that doesn't sound like me.

369
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
 There's no way I could ever make that up.

370
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
 This is proof that ghosts exist.

371
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 Believe me."

372
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,880
 And again, a skeptic's going to say, "No, it's easy to make that up.

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,480
 You could have made it up in post."

374
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,680
 And he's not saying that.

375
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,960
 He's saying, "Oh, sure."

376
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,440
 And there's a car driving by.

377
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,160
 But you hear, "Ghost man.

378
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,680
 Ghost man."

379
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,240
 But people really push this EVP meme.

380
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,600
 It's evolved past the put radio in the room and hit record and walk away or ask questions.

381
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:54,080
 What are you doing here?

382
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,440
 "Making macaroni and cheese."

383
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,440
 You hit this button and it randomly takes...

384
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,280
 It randomly tests out radio stations and picks out individual words.

385
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
 That's the way a ghost can talk to you now.

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
 They used to be able to write on mirrors.

387
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,440
 You remember in the old times when none of this existed, you'd walk into your house and

388
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,160
 you'd see "Help me on a mirror."

389
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,440
 During the 1900s in America, it was spiritualism.

390
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
 It was knocking, rapping.

391
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,440
 You walk into a house, one knock for yes, two knocks for no.

392
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 What are you making?

393
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,160
 Macaroni and cheese.

394
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,360
 But in knock form.

395
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,560
 I had macaroni and cheese for lunch.

396
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,000
 I was trying to figure out why I kept using that.

397
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,360
 But now, those have fallen out of vogue, writing in a foggy...

398
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,960
 What's the difference between a Ouija board and a spirit box?

399
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,680
 The answer is, Ouija boards have been...

400
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,440
 The scientists can go, "Well, that's an automatic response, a muscle response."

401
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,760
 They go, "Well, you can't fake this.

402
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,280
 You can't fake me hitting this button in its random radio station."

403
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,600
 First off, this is the use of a spirit box on the suicide bridge.

404
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,840
 You have two paranormal researchers and they're playing with a spirit box.

405
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,520
 You can get an idea for it.

406
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,560
 It'll be interesting because the video itself has subtitles of what they're saying.

407
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,840
 Because I read the subtitles, it's stuff like, "I'm a demon.

408
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
 Satan.

409
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
 Jump off the bridge."

410
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,320
 And it is like on a visceral level, it is creepy.

411
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,440
 But again, what's the audience they're marketing to?

412
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,360
 If you just had someone on the bridge going, "I hear a demon and he's telling me to jump.

413
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,520
 I don't want to jump.

414
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,320
 Oh no, I hear Satan's name."

415
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,760
 A person who believes in that stuff anyways is going to go, "Oh my God, suicide bridge.

416
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,560
 I once saw a video where a medium was on the bridge.

417
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,520
 This is trying to be marketed towards people who are skeptical or people who need quote

418
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,320
 unquote proof, but it's the most ridiculous proof because it's just random radio stations."

419
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,360
 The video is edited as well, which again, kind of throws it out that for all I know,

420
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,960
 they're waiting for five minutes for something to come across.

421
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,040
 So I would love, I would love to find, and if you guys know of really any like convincing,

422
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,480
 I'm not so much worried about the creepy aspects, convincing, non-faked EVPs, I'd love to hear

423
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,680
 them.

424
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,160
 I can't find any and I've been looking for a long time and I don't necessarily want

425
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,880
 them for proof because I do believe in ghosts.

426
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,560
 I have my questions and doubts about a lot of aspects of them, but I believe in them

427
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,080
 as a general thing.

428
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,520
 And I believe that some people may be more like, see ghosts more likely.

429
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,960
 We actually have an episode coming up on that in a couple days about gray spacing, TGA gray

430
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,760
 spacing, and it kind of plays into that.

431
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,560
 But I believe people may be more sensitive, but people who are actual mediums where they

432
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,000
 can like straight on telepathically commute and talk to the dead, I don't believe that.

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,720
 I don't believe that they can actually just like turn it on and off and talk to the dead

434
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
 like it's some sort of superpower.

435
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,240
 I think that they're, they're frauds in their line.

436
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,480
 And the same thing with this spirit box, it's simply a high tech fraud, a high tech lie

437
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,720
 or just random words that you're stringing together.

438
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,560
 So you're going, Jason, why did you wish my time telling me that story and making me

439
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,320
 listen to that EVP?

440
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,960
 Because I have a very important in segment here for you.

441
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,760
 Now the video I showed you, the woman in that video is smoking hot.

442
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,080
 I mean the care and listen, whoever made the EVP video on suicide bridge, they knew exactly

443
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,240
 what they were doing.

444
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,440
 The EVP device is sitting down on like a table or like a bench or whatever.

445
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,320
 The camera is sitting next to it to get a good view quote unquote of the EVP device.

446
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,680
 And it's also exactly chest level with this amazing, amazingly hot chick.

447
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
 So she's standing there.

448
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,720
 She's like, why did you jump off?

449
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
 She's talking into the microphone.

450
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,960
 Why did you jump off the bridge?

451
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,800
 And you're just like, I'm not paying attention to anything, but your amazing chest.

452
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
 That's complete.

453
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,440
 I mean, whoever, I don't think I would have even remembered the video because I watched

454
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,800
 so many EVP videos over the past couple of days.

455
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 She's gorgeous.

456
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,720
 And you're like, Jason, that's objectifying.

457
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
 And that's true.

458
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,760
 But the reason why I'm talking about this is young men out there, old men, whatever,

459
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,980
 you guys have heard of the red pill and the blue pill.

460
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,000
 So the blue pill, just a brief overview is like, you're basically like a beta male and

461
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
 you'll do whatever a girl does.

462
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,960
 You buy into the lies and the red pill is you finally awoken.

463
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,640
 The red pill is basically the dating equivalent of anti-cosmic Satanism, where it's this completely

464
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,320
 overblown like, I know all women are terrible and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

465
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,880
 I'm free of the game.

466
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 I am here to introduce to you guys the boo pill.

467
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,120
 What's the boo pill?

468
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,000
 The boo pill is that women love paranormal stuff.

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
 They love ghosts.

470
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,440
 They love tarot readings.

471
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,840
 They love magic.

472
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,360
 They love all that stuff.

473
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,280
 And psychologically, I don't know why.

474
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,040
 They absolutely love it.

475
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
 Take the boo pill.

476
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,400
 The boo pill is, is that if you start a paranormal group like this guy did, he found the hottest

477
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,080
 woman in whatever state he's in to go with him on a bridge in the middle of the night

478
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,640
 and talk into a broken radio.

479
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,960
 And she was having the time of her life.

480
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,080
 You want to take the boo pill?

481
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,520
 Take all of your skepticism, buy a decadterro card, but keep a couple of sparkly rocks

482
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
 in your pocket.

483
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,760
 Believe this stuff, dude.

484
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
 You start a paranormal group.

485
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,040
 You will be drowning in hot chicks, dude.

486
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,840
 Take the boo pill.

487
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,120
 Depending on...

488
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,440
 Obviously results may vary.

489
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,240
 However, I have gone out on many, many, many dates and I say, "Hey, you want to go to the

490
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 haunted forest?

491
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
 Hey, you want to go to this haunted house?

492
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,360
 Hey, you want to walk through the cemetery?"

493
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,520
 Oh yeah, totally.

494
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,480
 It's completely unusual and chicks love it.

495
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
 They love it.

496
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 It's adventurous.

497
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
 It's spooky.

498
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,200
 Girls love scary things.

499
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,560
 When you look at the opening results of big horror movies, the audience is almost always

500
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,040
 50% girls.

501
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,520
 The slasher films tend to be more male audience, especially like Hatchet or the direct-to-video

502
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
 stuff.

503
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,160
 But when you look at horror movies released at the theater, it's almost always 50% women.

504
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,680
 People don't realize that.

505
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,840
 They're like, "Oh, those movies are just for corny adolescent guys.

506
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 That's why there's always chicks in them."

507
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,600
 No, there's chicks in them because girls go to the movie and they want someone to relate

508
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,680
 to.

509
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,440
 Take the boo pill and you will...

510
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,440
 I don't want to say I guarantee it.

511
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,680
 But I guarantee it.

512
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,320
 You will meet some awesome, crazy hot chicks.

513
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
 If you just say, "You know what?

514
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,680
 I'm going to put all my skepticism aside.

515
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,400
 Maybe you don't have skepticism.

516
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,960
 You've just never taken the boo pill before."

517
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,280
 Start a paranormal club at your school.

518
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,600
 Put some flyers up around town.

519
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,960
 Now, of course, you're going to get some dudes and that's okay because you're also going

520
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,920
 to make some good friends out of it.

521
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,640
 But you're going to meet some smoking hot girls.

522
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
 Smoking hot.

523
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,200
 I've now officially lost all of my female listeners, but hopefully they will be back

524
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
 tomorrow.

525
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,320

 Twitter is @JasonOKarpenter.

528
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,800
 I think I want to get bombarded with either sexist comments or dude.

529
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 I took the boo pill.

530
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 You're right.

531
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,360
 I expect both of those, actually.

532
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,560
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

533
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

534
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,760
 Have a great one, guys.

535
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
 Bye.

536
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,760
 Bye.

537
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,760
 Bye.
