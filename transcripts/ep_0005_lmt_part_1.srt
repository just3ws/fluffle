1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 It was a cold wintery night, December 8th, 1980.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,700
 John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning from a recording studio and headed home.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,200
 Out of the darkness, a man appeared.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,480
 He raised his gun and fired, ending the life of one of music's greatest legends.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 The killer's name, Stephen King.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 How's that for an intro?

7
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 If I sounded a little more lively when I was doing that intro, it's because I recorded it weeks ago when I was planning on doing another podcast, which actually now, I've had to change the name of this podcast.

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 If you listen to the last four episodes, it's The Fourteenth Family.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,480
 I had that name. I started getting some really weird emails.

10
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:33,480
 There wasn't the only reason I changed it. There were issues with web domains and things like that.

11
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 The emails will stop. Whatever weirdo is doing that can be done with that.

12
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 Now we're Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 Dead Rabbit Radio. You can find us at DeadRabbit.com.

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
 My name is Jason Carpenter.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 It's 11.30 at night. Sorry. It's 11.44. I'm dead tired. I've been at it all day long.

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 But I wanted to get an episode out for you guys. And to me, I think it's one of the seminal episodes.

17
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,480
 It's one of the seminal episodes.

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 Because it is one of the topics that inspired me to do a podcast in the first place.

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,480
 This is the biggest conspiracy that has ever...

20
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 Well, let me back up.

21
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,480
 So you heard the intro.

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 Did Stephen King kill John Lennon? It seems...

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,480
 Obviously. It seems obvious that no, he didn't.

24
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,480
 But as you go further and further down the rabbit hole that Stephen Lightfoot,

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 Intrepid journalist and fighter for truth has created, as you crawl down the rabbit hole with him,

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 you will see that maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, he's onto something. Do I think so?

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
 I can't say I wasn't there.

28
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,480
 For the past, what would it be now 30 years?

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 Stephen Lightfoot has been a lone crusader on this journey.

30
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 He believes that Stephen King killed John Lennon, and he believes that this is the biggest conspiracy

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
 since the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. That is on the level he puts it on.

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:44,480
 His website, LennonMurderTruth.com, is a goldmine of manifestos, of diatribes, of rants,

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 of exploring the clues over who did what and how it affects us now.

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 You will get lost in this website, trust me.

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,480
 Because when I first found out about this website, it was on a lark, I was listening,

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,480
 and I think too, there is a good podcast called "Those Conspiracy Guys."

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,480
 It's good, they just have really thick accents from Ireland.

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,480
 That's a fun podcast, and the episodes are super long.

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 But anyways, I think they're the ones who first brought this to my attention, that Stephen King killed John Lennon.

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 So it is out there in the conspiracy world.

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 But I went to this website and I thought,

42
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 if I could just listen to this website, I was at work, and I was like,

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,480
 all I want to do is listen to this website, I want to go deeper and deeper into this man's psyche.

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 So what I've decided to do, is I'm going to go ahead and read you his introduction.

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 As a dramatic reading, talk a little bit about it after the fact, after it's done, if I'm still awake.

46
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,480
 But we're going to go ahead and we're going to word for word go over his introduction,

47
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 go over his main chunk of evidence that Stephen King killed John Lennon.

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:04,480
 So please, sit back, put your tinfoil hat on, grab a nice soda soaked with a Spartmatae and BMO,

49
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 and get ready to enter the mind of Stephen Lightfoot, the crusader who will expose the true murderer of John Lennon.

50
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 [Music]

51
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,480
 Contrary to all reports about a lone drifter named Mark David Chapman,

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
 who allegedly shot John Lennon in the back December 8, 1980,

53
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 you'll find ample evidence in the back issues of Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report magazines to suggest otherwise.

54
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 Namely that John Lennon was not only politically assassinated, but that Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and you'd better sit down.

55
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,480
 Horror novelist Stephen King are the three people who can be proven guilty of the crime.

56
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 King being the real murderer and Chapman but a lookalike paid actor misleading you with an absolute hoax, the media in tow.

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 The evidence is specifically government codes in the bold print headlines of Time, Newsweek, and US News and World Report magazines that were printed shortly before, during, and after the night of December 8, 1980.

58
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:42,480
 Hints in the headlines that you won't find anywhere else that plug into John Lennon's assassination with up to 70% frequency at times.

59
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,480
 These government codes which read like gallows humor?

60
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,480
 Thinking about John Lennon, Johnny comes marching home, kiss kiss bang bang ouch ouch.

61
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
 The job Richard Nixon really wanted, blasting the opposition.

62
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 America needs a poet laureate, maybe, heeding those subtle signs, magazine maze, all the president's magazines.

63
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 These codes include the killer's face and true identity printed three and two months before the crime, replete with headlines describing the then yet to come crime scene.

64
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,480
 One great big zippo-lider perils of pyrokinesis.

65
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 Pyrokinesis means fire and movement, and the man at night with a gun ablaze, crouched in a raincoat looks like a great big cigarette lighter.

66
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,480
 Subtle but dramatic codes.

67
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:57,480
 These crypto codes include Mark David Chapman, the alleged name of the killer printed three weeks before the murder, where Chapman writes that he is "armed upon waiting to be moved into a hostile square by the giant hand of Ronald Reagan."

68
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 These government codes include dramatic photos of just elected Ronald Reagan sitting next to Richard Nixon's book, The Real War in Time and Newsweek Issues, released the day of the murder.

69
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:24,480
 In Time, the bold headline above Reagan reads "who's in, who's out" and below "fitting together the pieces of a complicated jigsaw puzzle."

70
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 That Richard Nixon tried to deport John Lennon in the 70s is a known fact.

71
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,480
 John's peace activism and lyrical barbs at Tricky Dickie and his perhaps unparalleled worldview made John a target.

72
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 Well, inside The Real War, several pages explain "the prancing of the trendies, rock stars, beautiful people of New York who say war is bad and peace is good must be removed from the stage of public debate by whatever means."

73
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 "A flyswatter are needed."

74
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 He even titles this philosophy the Nixon Doctrine Translation.

75
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
 Reagan's Inn, Lennon's Out.

76
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,480
 In fact, The Real John Lennon and The Real Richard Nixon are two codes that precede the crime.

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 Last, but certainly not least, according to identical matching photos of Stephen King attached to book reviews about Firestarter months before the assassination, the man photographed getting Lennon's autograph hours before he killed him is not Mark Chapman like we were all told.

78
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,480
 Chapman's glasses are the wrong prescription.

79
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,480
 His features are more centrally boxed in the middle of his face and his hair is the wrong texture.

80
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 As well as the fact that the killer has dimples that Chapman does not, only Stephen King's features exactly trace the proportions of the autographed town.

81
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 Chapman is a look-alike actor.

82
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 This was the last coded evidence puzzle piece that I found.

83
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 Not knowing then who Stephen King was.

84
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 This was back in 1982, my first clues being the "who's in, who's out" headlines above Reagan months earlier.

85
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:27,480
 I turned to my library then, utterly convinced that the government had killed John Lennon based on the news clippings that appeared in June of 1982, a year and a half after the crime, where Chapman pleaded guilty two days before his trial and was sentenced 20 years to life.

86
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 Buried in a tiny corner of the back section, I knew a cover-up was at work.

87
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:42,480
 It was several weeks later while trying to find magazines that carried the murder report that I literally stumbled onto these codes.

88
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 Now I was confronted months later with who actually pulled the trigger.

89
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 Famous author Stephen King?

90
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
 Too much to believe.

91
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 Beyond comprehension, overall our heads is Nixon that tricky?

92
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 Well, buckle up good readers.

93
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:15,480
 Stephen King writes all about it in the beginning of Salem's lot, five years before the crime, where he writes about shooting a man in the shoulder blades, talking to a politician with a gun in the dead zone, Johnny being the main character.

94
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,480
 He even writes about "the fellow who killed John Lennon" in, I believe, three books.

95
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 He practically confesses in his 1983 Playboy interview he has even admitted to me in his own handwriting that "I" haven't got the whole story yet, and in a subsequent letter, signed Stephen King, he throws an availed bribe if I'd quit exposing this.

96
00:11:41,480 --> 00:12:10,480
 In summary, the story about Mark Chapman is a cover of bold, print, government, cryptograph codes that include the killer's face, and true identity, the killer's alleged name and letter to the editor printed before the murder and Richard Nixon's book, The Real War, in back issues of time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report magazines printed before, during and after the night of December 8, 1980, prove that Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan arranged for the author Stephen King then barely found the killer.

97
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:24,480
 Stephen King then barely famous to assassinate John Lennon, that King's writings draw dramatically from the crime and that he taunts us all in his interviews and comments only make this the story of a lifetime.

98
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 My 24 page booklet contains everything you've seen here and much more, please order your copy. I guarantee is the absolute truth of what really happened to John Lennon.

99
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 Happy Code Cracky.

100
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 This is like a whirlwind of words. You know, in all seriousness, generally a sign of mental disorder, disorganized thinking, is finding patterns in things that have no patterns.

101
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 I don't know what disorder could be part of, but generally when people make patterns where there aren't patterns, we all do in a sense, we look up at the clouds, we go, "Hey, that looks like America, that looks like a boat."

102
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 But somebody else can flip randomly through the television or hear a radio, like five songs in a row and they think it's some sort of sign there, they can put these connections together in their head and it makes totally logical sense.

103
00:13:44,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 When we hear him rattle off those, well, I rattled it off, but when he wrote off all of those headlines, you could go, "Well, yeah, some of those headlines do, he could kind of be something."

104
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 But remember, he's reading them off of multiple magazines and they're published in a short amount of time and he's picking out this pattern that's giving him this idea.

105
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:26,480
 Really, honestly, how he got the Stephen King thing is still beyond me, other than the beginning of Salem's lot, like he said, apparently has that and then the hair, he goes into the way that they look.

106
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 I mean, I guess it kind of looks like Stephen King and, you know, so his website is hundreds of pages long and actually got according to him and I believe him, I don't think he's necessarily a liar, but he said he got hacked and he lost a lot of his pages.

107
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 When I was in the works to do this podcast a while back, I wanted to do a podcast about Stephen Lifehood or at least some episodes in Stephen Lifehood.

108
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 I actually archived a lot of his website and saved it because I was afraid, you know, what if something happens to him, he doesn't pay his internet bill, I mean, he doesn't pay his hosting bill and all of this just ingenious insanity could be both disappeared.

109
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 So I actually archived it and I thought about contacting him and saying, hey, I know a lot of your pages are gone because you can look through there, but I don't know how he's going to take it, honestly.

110
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 I'll say this, I think everyone should go visit lennonmurdertruth.com and I could say it facetiously and say to learn the truth yourself, but it's just fascinating.

111
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,480
 I'm sure I'm going to cover it because he updates his stuff every day, not every day, but he's constantly updating it.

112
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,480
 So website that I can keep going back to and trust me that introduction.

113
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
 That's just the tip of the iceberg.

114
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 Now, depending on how like if people like that that I'm going over his stuff, I'll continue to do it.

115
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
 People are like, oh, it's so boring.

116
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
 Just kind of reading the stuff off.

117
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,480
 I was trying to give it a little bit of zing, but yeah, I just find the whole thing fascinating.

118
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 What's funny is that, well, it's not funny, but if you go deeper into his, oh, you know what?

119
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,480
 I probably should have started with that episode.

120
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 He has another one that's a little more zingy.

121
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 You know what?

122
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 We'll throw that in tomorrow.

123
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
 I'll do that tomorrow.

124
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 So today we had the introduction to Stephen Lightfoot.

125
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:28,480
 Tomorrow I will do a little bit more of an overview because this episode is already recorded, but I think it does give you an interview.

126
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
 So part one.

127
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
 I hope you guys are excited.

128
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:39,480
 Tomorrow is going to be part two of the Stephen Lightfoot did Stephen King kill John Lennon murder mystery.

129
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 So I hope you had fun.

130
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,480
 Welcome to the Dead Rabbit Radio.

131
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
 Welcome to Dead Rabbit Radio.

132
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 This is going to be the new name of the podcast.

133
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 We are the fastest growing podcast in the city of Hood River.

134
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
 Everyone have a great night.

135
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 It is now 1217.

136
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 I'm going to finish this diet Pepsi and I'm going to go to bed.

137
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,480
 And then tomorrow we will get you part two of who shot John Lennon.

138
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
 Have a great night guys.

139
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:29,480
