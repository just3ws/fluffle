1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Can your boss force you to get an exorcism?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,840
 A little girl goes missing and the culprit may be a character from one of our previous

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,640
 episodes.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,400
 And then finally we take a look at the story of the Loveland Frogman, or Frogmonster cut.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
 And then we take a look at the Loveland Frog.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,760
 A cryptid who has friends, a magic wand, and quite the adventure until the police open fire

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,080
 on him today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,760
 [Music]

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,600
 We're coming up to episode 200.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,400
 Episode 200 of Dead Rabbit Radio might be some surprises in the store.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 You don't know.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
 You don't know.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,360
 I don't even know.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,240
 That's how much of a surprise it may be.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,840
 Or simple lack of being prepared.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,520
 I think when the 100th episode came around I just was like, "Oh here's a normal episode."

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,920
 And then afterwards I was like, "Oh man I should have done something cool for that."

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
 Or the way my memory works.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,480
 We may have done something totally awesome for episode 100 and I've just forgotten right

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
 now.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,960
 But we're on episode, I think this is episode 193, 194.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
 But we're close to 200, so that's awesome.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,760
 We're also close to the end of season 4.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,120
 We're going to be going into season 5.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,320
 I don't know if I'm going to take a week off.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
 Normally I do.

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,640
 I think I've kind of found a bit of peace with certain things for the show I can't control.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,440
 Or I'm like, "I just want to take a little bit longer for me to go into the YouTube system

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,080
 and add the tags."

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,720
 I used to be really religious about going in there and putting the tags up the first

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,600
 night and hitting all these buttons and da da da da da.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,160
 And it was totally wearing me out.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,920
 And it was taking like an hour and a half a night to do all this back in stuff that

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,480
 you guys don't even see.

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,520
 It helps other people find the videos, but I was totally freaking out about it and now

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,360
 I'm just like, "I've made my peace with that."

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,200
 Because the show is fun to do and that stuff sucks.

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,480
 I know it's important to do, but it was just taking up way too much of my time.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,120
 Responding to the comments, I love doing that.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,640
 I love responding to comments.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,080
 Sometimes that takes me a while too.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,320
 But you got all the back in stuff I don't like.

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,200
 But anyways, I guess I should say I really appreciate it when you guys do market the

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
 show for me.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,760
 Because that's great.

50
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,400
 Telling your friends and you're like, "Jason, you won't even do it yourself."

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 I do.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
 I actually put up flyers and I do a lot of word of mouth stuff.

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,960
 YouTube algorithm sucks.

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,080
 Anyways, I love it that you guys get the word out, wink wink, and I have flyers that you

55
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,240
 can print out just like I do.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,680
 Wherever you frequent, you can get those images in the show notes in the links below.

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
 I really appreciate that.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
 We have a merch store too, but there's just something real punk rock about walking around

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
 with flyers.

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
 Oh yeah, and you can wear a dead rabbit shirt while you're doing it.

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,800
 But yeah, just walking around with flyers passing them out to people.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
 I love doing that stuff.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
 Okay, that's enough of the back in stuff.

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,720
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

65
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,840
 Now, the first story we're going to talk about actually just happened.

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,040
 Well, I should, let me clarify that.

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,680
 I just found out about it, which there's probably a difference between those two things.

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,120
 We're going, I didn't know this place was real by the way.

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,080
 We're going to Kentucky, I knew that place was real.

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,960
 We're going to Kentucky, we're going to the city of hazard, Kentucky.

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,320
 Now is that where the Dukes of Hazard took place?

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,440
 I'm pretty sure, but I thought the Dukes of Hazard was spelt with two Zs.

73
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
 Apparently this one's just one Z like the real, but the Dukes of Hazard town, we're

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
 going, Dead Rabbit Radio is going to the town of Dukes of Hazard.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,080
 If you don't know what the Dukes of Hazard is, then I hold my head for the childhood

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,240
 memories that you didn't share with me.

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,760
 Dukes of Hazard was, it was a story about basically vigilantes in a race car.

78
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Were they vigilantes?

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
 They basically just didn't do what the cops said.

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,800
 It was a small town with like this corrupt sheriff.

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,760
 It was super bizarre because it was like this corrupt Southern sheriff who was basically

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,120
 just like bullying people around and then the Dukes brothers, the Dukes brothers, Bo

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,960
 and Luke, Duke was it?

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
 Bo and I don't know.

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 But anyways, the Dukes brothers, you're like Jason just gets into the stupid story, but

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,240
 the Dukes brothers basically were like Robin Hood type characters and then Daisy Duke walked

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,400
 around that was their cousin I believe and she wore Daisy Dukes.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,680
 She wore the shorts that just came up right to her butt cheeks.

89
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,600
 So anyways, that's the story of the Dukes of Hazard.

90
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,240
 Oh, I also should mention they had a Confederate flag on the top of their car and when they

91
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,800
 honked their horn it played Dixie.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,440
 So yeah, I guess I should throw that in there too, but they weren't racist.

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
 They weren't.

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,240
 They just really liked the Confederate flag in the song Dixie.

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,760
 So anyways, anyways, we're in Hazard County.

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,040
 Sorry, no, that's the show.

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,480
 Well damn Duke boys, don't know what's going.

98
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 Okay, okay.

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 So we're in Kentucky.

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,080
 We're in the city of Hazard.

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,480
 Now there's a dude there named Jason Fields and let me say too, this is all alleged.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,560
 This is all alleged.

103
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,080
 This is going through court right now.

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,720
 So Jason Fields works at a hotel and he's talking to his boss, his boss's name Sharon

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 Linden.

106
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,280
 Jason goes, Hey, it's on her and you know, I'm going through some marital trouble right

107
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
 now.

108
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,160
 I'm getting a divorce and Sharon's like, really?

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,540
 And he's like, yeah, yeah, I just, I don't think things are going to work out between

110
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,360
 me and my wife and that damn Roscoe Peacow train stole my girl.

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
 And so Sharon go, okay, okay, that's the lab.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,200
 Trust me, that's the last hazard joke because I don't know how many of you guys get the

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
 references.

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,520
 Anyway, so Sharon Linden says, you know, I've had trouble in my life as well.

115
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,280
 I had trouble with them Duke boys.

116
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,960
 So she goes, I had trouble in my life as well.

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,040
 What you need is a cleansing.

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
 Jason's like, huh, that's kind of weird.

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,740
 Now Sharon is Jason's boss and he kind of is like, no, no, I'm fine.

120
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,780
 You know, he has his own religious beliefs.

121
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,460
 He doesn't really know what the cleansing is.

122
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,620
 He doesn't really want to know what the cleansing is, but Sharon goes, well, it's kind of like

123
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,740
 an exorcism and you get this cleansing.

124
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,540
 You basically, your marital problems are being caused by demons.

125
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,620
 We got to cleanse the demons from you, Jason.

126
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,100
 We got to get them out of you.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,700
 Now he says that that made him feel uncomfortable, but whatever.

128
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,840
 So he'd simply politely declined the offer and went about his business and she kept saying,

129
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,080
 Jason, you need to get the demons out of you.

130
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
 You need to get cleansed.

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
 I've had four cleansings myself.

132
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
 Look at me.

133
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,640
 I'm fine, which I would have to wonder why you would need four of them.

134
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
 Not just the first one doesn't work.

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,640
 There's there is it like washing clothes like you got to keep working the stand out.

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,760
 There are like a couple of demons still clanging on to you or does she keep doing bad stuff

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
 and the demons keep finding her again?

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 I don't know.

139
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,300
 But anyways, at one point, Jason Fields, this was kind of the straw that broke the camel's

140
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
 back.

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
 There was two straws.

142
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,820
 One, one day he walked into work.

143
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
 Imagine the scenario.

144
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,220
 You walk into work and you see your super weirdo religious boss standing there in the corner

145
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,780
 with her back to you like the Blair Witch.

146
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,460
 No, she's standing there and she's like, I'm so glad you've come to work.

147
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,180
 And then you see like 15 people who are members of her church.

148
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,540
 You've never met him before, but you can just tell their members of her church because

149
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,840
 they get in front of you and start praying in front of you.

150
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,080
 And she's like, we are cleansing you.

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,760
 We are cleansing you.

152
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,920
 I don't know if she actually said that, but they were cleansing him and he got really

153
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
 uncomfortable.

154
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
 It'd be super bizarre.

155
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,080
 I mean, I get it.

156
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,840
 Like sometimes people at work will be like, you know, I'm praying for you.

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
 And I'm like, okay, no, I appreciate that.

158
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 That's cool.

159
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,880
 But it's totally different if someone like bows down and actually it'd be kind of cool.

160
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,840
 Someone bow down in front of you and started praying.

161
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,980
 But 15 of them, especially if I wasn't down with their religious practice would be a little

162
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
 weird.

163
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,580
 But really what ended his employment there?

164
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,140
 What finally made him quit?

165
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,020
 Was one day his boss came in with a questionnaire and says, you need to fill this out.

166
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,340
 He's like, oh, okay, it must be like for benefits or something.

167
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
 Am I getting life insurance?

168
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,780
 And she's just like, fill it out.

169
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,460
 Oh, you're getting life insurance.

170
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
 Eternal life insurance.

171
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,700
 And then she just walked away and he's like, oh, great.

172
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,120
 This is what some of the questions were on the survey.

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,880
 His boss gave him, were you a planned child?

174
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,360
 Were you conceived out of wedlock?

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,760
 Those kind of go together.

176
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,160
 Have you ever visited heathen temples?

177
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,200
 He's like, yes, stone temple pilot saw him in like 95.

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,680
 Were they even around back then?

179
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
 Do you have any witches?

180
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 Here's another question.

181
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,320
 Do you have any witches such as good luck kitchen witches in your home?

182
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,800
 What is that?

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,580
 Is that a thing, a good luck kitchen witch?

184
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,660
 Is it like an elf on a shelf, but it's all year round and it's just like this crone who

185
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,540
 hangs out in your kitchen other than your ex-wife?

186
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,040
 Duh-duh-ch.

187
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,020
 To your knowledge, was there, here's the other question.

188
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,780
 To your, I'm not asking you this directly.

189
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,300
 To your knowledge, was there evidence of lust in your family line?

190
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,220
 That's kind of vague and probably because they've had kids.

191
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,980
 They may be using the biblical term lust, but if you just ask, has anyone in your family

192
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,680
 ever been lusty ever since they've had sex multiple times?

193
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,360
 That's why I exist.

194
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,800
 She asked also, do you have lustful thoughts?

195
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,840
 Do you frequently masturbate?

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,360
 Check check for me.

197
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,400
 And have you ever sexually fantasized about an animal?

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
 Weird.

199
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,680
 That one seems probably the weirdest one there.

200
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,240
 Because it just kind of popped up.

201
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,920
 Everything else you're like, yeah, I can understand someone.

202
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 But why that?

203
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
 That's super specific.

204
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,280
 But anyways, so those are just some of the questions.

205
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
 He didn't turn it in.

206
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,660
 He actually quit, suitor, and they're now facing a lawsuit.

207
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,820
 But this is in America, and I'm sure it's true in most countries, there's a thing called

208
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,780
 hostile work environment.

209
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:06,020
 When your boss is forcing you to get exercised, that is pretty much the definition of a hostile

210
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,100
 work environment.

211
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,260
 You can't talk about, you can't really make religion part of your job unless your job

212
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,660
 is the pope or priest.

213
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
 But you can't really.

214
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,400
 And so no, she's going to lose this lawsuit.

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,880
 She'll probably lose the lawsuit if he kept that form, which is what he should have done.

216
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
 Weird story.

217
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 Weird, weird story.

218
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
 Okay, so our next story actually is a real short one.

219
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,560
 Now I don't know, I announced it at the beginning of the week and then I cut it out for time,

220
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,240
 but this was supposed to be Missing Persons Week.

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
 And now we're like three episodes in.

222
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,880
 And I was like, oh yeah, I edited that out.

223
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,400
 Because that first episode was like an hour long, and the second episode was like an hour

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
 long.

225
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,780
 And I was like, I'm going to go on and remove whole chunks of the show.

226
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,700
 So some of it got lost.

227
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,580
 On yesterday's episode during the Pombero, I talked about this little guy named the Yisi

228
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,080
 Yacera.

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,860
 He's also a little troll man who lives in South America.

230
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,060
 I'm just saying it now because I cut it out yesterday.

231
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,460
 He's a little troll man who lives in South America.

232
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,340
 What he does is he kidnaps kids and plays with them and then he licks them on the face

233
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,540
 and gives them epilepsy and makes them mentally disabled.

234
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,380
 Or drowns them.

235
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,380
 Pick your poison.

236
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,260
 You're like, Jason, that's incredibly out of place for this episode, but I just wanted

237
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,480
 to fit that fact in somewhere because it's actually in the show notes for yesterday's

238
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,680
 episode totally got cut for time.

239
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,660
 But this story here is part of Missing Persons Week, which you're now just being made aware

240
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
 of.

241
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,740
 Very short story, tragic, but it's a call back to a cryptid or a ghost that we have

242
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,040
 covered in previous episodes.

243
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,660
 We're going to Chisholm, Minnesota.

244
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,100
 And there we see the grieving family.

245
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,900
 You're like, great Jason, another one of these ones.

246
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,860
 And there we meet the grieving family of the Warners.

247
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,100
 It's June 14th, 2003.

248
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,660
 Liana Warner has just gone missing.

249
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
 They can't find her.

250
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,820
 Little five-year-old girl.

251
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,180
 She goes missing.

252
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,900
 She went to walk to her friend's house a couple streets away, which she had made this walk

253
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,020
 multiple times before.

254
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,180
 But she gets to her friend's house, there's no one home, and then she starts walking back

255
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,980
 home and that's the last time anyone sees her in the neighborhood.

256
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,980
 Totally gone.

257
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,780
 And I know you think, in five years old, who's walking through the town by themselves, and

258
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,060
 it's weird.

259
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,460
 But it was normal when I was growing up, and it was normal every single time she did this

260
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,180
 journey this time she just happened to go missing.

261
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
 Huge search party, they can't find her at all.

262
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,060
 Now the cops said, listen, after they keep searching and searching and searching, they

263
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,140
 go, we think it's foul play.

264
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,940
 We think if a five-year-old set out on her own, we would have found her by now.

265
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,500
 There's only so many places you can go into town.

266
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,540
 We've got this massive party looking for her.

267
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,860
 We think she was kidnapped.

268
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,700
 So that was the path of investigation they were taking.

269
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,820
 They do find a child's footprint near a lake.

270
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,340
 They drained the lake.

271
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
 Nothing.

272
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,140
 And they're like, okay, well, back to square one.

273
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,740
 But we will keep looking for this kid.

274
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,180
 But what's weird about this is that you have, generally when children go missing, you have

275
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,740
 the usual suspects.

276
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,980
 All of a sudden you find out your town is full of perverts because the cops immediately

277
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,660
 start going through their logs and they go, this guy was arrested for this.

278
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,900
 This guy was arrested for this.

279
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,100
 So they talk to one guy.

280
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,140
 He had been caught with child pornography.

281
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,860
 They go and investigate him.

282
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,380
 He kills himself.

283
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,060
 But the cops go, we don't think he had anything to do with her disappearance.

284
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,540
 We think he killed himself because he was about to go to prison for child porn.

285
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,420
 So other people in town think he was murdered.

286
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,020
 But a weirdo suspect.

287
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,100
 Another weirdo suspect, a guy who kidnapped two girls a couple years earlier.

288
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
 He was writing in his journal.

289
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,660
 Who keeps journals?

290
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,260
 He was writing in his journal saying, I'm afraid I'm going to get blamed for the kidnapping

291
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,940
 of Leanne.

292
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,380
 But you know, he was, they investigated him and he wasn't real suspect.

293
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,140
 She's never been found.

294
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,460
 But that's not what made me want to cover this story.

295
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,020
 This is the weird part.

296
00:13:53,020 --> 00:14:01,460
 Before her disappearance, Leanne comes home with a case full of Barbies and clothing.

297
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,380
 She puts it on the table.

298
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
 Opens it up.

299
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,780
 Her mom's like, where'd you get those?

300
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,060
 Where'd you get those Barbies?

301
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
 Those aren't yours.

302
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
 Did you get this from a friend?

303
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,500
 And she's like, no.

304
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,700
 The old lady gave them to me.

305
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,020
 That's weird.

306
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,100
 And then about a week before she goes missing, her parents see her packing a suitcase.

307
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,660
 They go, Leanne, what are you doing?

308
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,500
 She's like, oh, I'm getting ready to go live with my new family.

309
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,140
 Shuts the suitcase.

310
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,580
 Now the police have said that they don't think that that has anything to do with their disappearance.

311
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,340
 But when I read that, I immediately, my mind went back to the candy lady of Texas.

312
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,540
 The woman who was supposedly leaving candy on kids' window sills, enticing them to come

313
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
 out.

314
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,740
 And she didn't hide outside your window, and once you reach for candy, her clawed hands

315
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,260
 grab you and pull you up.

316
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,580
 She heard, the goal was to get you out of the house to come with her willingly.

317
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,180
 She wasn't a monster underneath your bed.

318
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,780
 She was like a monster in society, again, if she existed at all.

319
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,340
 But I think it's interesting that you have that same parallel hair.

320
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,900
 You have this old lady who this girl met, and she gave her these toys.

321
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,260
 Here, you can have these toys.

322
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,980
 Could have been totally innocent, but could have also been a total creep weirdo.

323
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,780
 Given her these toys.

324
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,220
 And then being like, you should come stay with me.

325
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,100
 I'll be your grandma, and you'll have a new grandpa and a new mama.

326
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 It would be so fun.

327
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,460
 And the girl's like, that does sound like fun.

328
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,460
 We don't know how many times this little girl, Leanna, interacted with this old lady, whether

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,180
 it was a one-off thing, where some old lady was throwing away a bunch of stuff, and she

330
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,620
 goes, hey kid, come here.

331
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
 Come here.

332
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
 You want some Barbies?

333
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,700
 Or if it was a grooming process.

334
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,780
 But what I know is this girl got these Barbie dolls from someone the family didn't know.

335
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,380
 A week before she disappears, packing a suitcase to go visit a family the family doesn't know.

336
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
 And then she disappears.

337
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,460
 I just think it's creepy, because it's almost like, what if the candy lady of Texas isn't

338
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,700
 so much like a serial killer or a ghost or an urban legend or whatever.

339
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,100
 What if it's just like an archetype?

340
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,420
 What if it's a blueprint for how old, creepy women can kidnap kids?

341
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,140
 Like they can't overpower them.

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,960
 That's not in their, they don't have the ability to do that, because their bones are already

343
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,380
 made of like dust.

344
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,940
 Their skin is this thick as paper.

345
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,580
 But I, okay, that's, I'm talking about mummies at that point.

346
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
 But you know what I mean?

347
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,820
 Like, an adult, a healthy adult can overpower a kid.

348
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,540
 This is getting grim, but an old, the older and weaker you are, the more you have to use

349
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,180
 guile to get them.

350
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,540
 There may be candy ladies all over the world who aren't trying to be like, come check out

351
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,620
 this puppy or jump out of the bushes.

352
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:04,860
 They could just be leaving a trail of toys or sweets or just words of encouragement to

353
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,940
 finally get that kid out of the safety of their own home.

354
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,500
 But let's go ahead and move on to a fun story.

355
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 A fun story.

356
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,060
 It does involve a couple things getting blown away, but it's a lot more fun than that last

357
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,340
 story.

358
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:27,780
 This story was actually in a roundabout way a request on Twitter, because I asked if we

359
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,580
 had a cryptid Olympics who should be involved in it.

360
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,300
 And the first people to respond were on Twitter, the cafe in diner, which is cafe underscore

361
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,140
 and underscore diner.

362
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,260
 I really, really recommend checking them out.

363
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,700
 It's a really cool Twitter account.

364
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,540
 And then also Jester, who also is a follower of cafe and diner.

365
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
 Yeah, check it out.

366
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
 I've recommended that Twitter account a couple times.

367
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,580
 They got some really cool things going on there that I think is just right for the fans

368
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
 of the show.

369
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,220
 But they said, "Lovelyn Frog."

370
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,020
 That was the fur, they're like, "Lovelyn Frog, Cryptid Olympics, he has to go."

371
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,580
 And I have, I was familiar with the name, Lovelyn Frog, but never looked into it.

372
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,260
 This guy's pretty dope.

373
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,100
 I don't know if he'd win the Cryptid Olympics, but let's take a look at his resume here.

374
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,660
 So we're going to Lovelyn Ohio.

375
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,340
 Did you guys ever see that old show from the 70s, the Dukes of Lovelyn?

376
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,620
 This is where it took place.

377
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,140
 Lovelyn Ohio, the year is 1955.

378
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,340
 Now I can do my doo-wop music that I didn't get to do yesterday.

379
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,300
 This guy's driving down the road.

380
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,100
 This businessman is driving down a road late at night in Lovelyn Ohio, turning up a little

381
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,220
 bit of his doo-wop music.

382
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,780
 And he sees on the side of the road three humanoid figures just kind of standing up.

383
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
 And he's like, "What?

384
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
 What is this?

385
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
 They look weird.

386
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,020
 They're on two feet, but they just look kind of lumpy and their eyes are in the...

387
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,300
 They're frogs."

388
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:12,780
 And what he's seeing is three, four feet tall frogs standing up, having a conversation on

389
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,220
 the side of the road.

390
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,420
 He starts slowing his car down and then at one point one of the frogs turn, one of the

391
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,220
 frogs sees him, sees the human now watching them, and he turns, he looks at the human,

392
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,900
 he pulls a wand out, not the human.

393
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,420
 The frog man pulls out a wand, a big metal wand, like a magic wand, and then sparks shoot

394
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,500
 out at the top of it and the businessman drives away totally scared.

395
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,180
 So that was really the origin of the Lovelyn frog.

396
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,100
 It should really be Lovelyn frogs, but became a local phenomenon.

397
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,180
 It basically became their big foot.

398
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,820
 Everyone at Lovelyn was like, "They hear this story?

399
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,780
 They're like, 'Oh my God, they're frog people out there.'

400
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,500
 Now it was passed down from generation to generation.

401
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 Dads would tell their kids and kids would tell each other in the schoolyard and all this

402
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 sort of stuff.

403
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 Better be careful.

404
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,700
 There's a frog man in the woods."

405
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,700
 Now what's interesting is this, the first sighting, there's multiple variations of it,

406
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
 which tends to make you think it's an urban legend.

407
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,740
 Sometimes it's a businessman, sometimes it's a vacuum cleaner salesman, sometimes I think

408
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,660
 he's walking, sometimes he's driving.

409
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,260
 There's different variations, but they're slight.

410
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,940
 They all involve three frogs, a magic wand, and sparks.

411
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,660
 So the fact that those variations as small as they are do lend it a little more weight

412
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,380
 than the typical urban legend.

413
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,580
 Like Bloody Mary, say you have a baby, sometimes you say Bloody Mary three times, sometimes

414
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,940
 you say it ten times.

415
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,620
 Sometimes the urban legend's a little more concrete, gives it a little more weight, which

416
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,860
 is what concrete tends to do.

417
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,980
 But everyone's talking about this thing.

418
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
 It's their big foot.

419
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,860
 So in 1972, when a police officer is driving down the roads of Loveland late one night

420
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,380
 and he sees it, everything changes.

421
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,060
 It's March 3rd, 1972, and officer Ray Shockey is driving down the road.

422
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,780
 He sees a four foot tall creature, reptile, standing up by the side of the road.

423
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,140
 And it's fully illuminated by his headlights.

424
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,380
 He can see it perfectly.

425
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,020
 It's this giant reptilian creature that's four feet tall, standing up, and it climbs

426
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,700
 over a guardrail and kind of jumps down into the river.

427
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,780
 And he it scares him to death.

428
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
 Absolutely.

429
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,900
 And he reports it.

430
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,420
 And everyone makes fun of him.

431
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,900
 They're like, "Oh, Shockey saw the frog, man.

432
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,340
 Shockey saw the frog, man."

433
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,940
 They're like giving him squirrelies and wedges.

434
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,620
 He's like, "Nah, I'm an officer of the law.

435
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
 Don't do this."

436
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,620
 But he got teased.

437
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,940
 It would be the same thing.

438
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,100
 That's why Air Force pilots don't report that they've seen UFOs or regular pilots or whatever.

439
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,500
 You're gonna get ridiculed.

440
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,060
 And he was ridiculed.

441
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,700
 But he had a good buddy on the force, Mark Matthews.

442
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
 Mark Matthews.

443
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,340
 Now, he was also an officer.

444
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,020
 And he was like, "You know what?

445
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,940
 I believe Shockey."

446
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,860
 He had a button that says, "I believe Shockey."

447
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,140
 He's like, "Do you want to wear this?"

448
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,300
 He's handing them out around town.

449
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
 People are like, "No."

450
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,940
 I don't know who that guy is.

451
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,460
 But anyways, so Mark Matthews was on a mission.

452
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,900
 He wanted to prove his friend right.

453
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,260
 But then, you know, he was also a cop.

454
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,620
 He also had to arrest people and do traffic stops and stuff like that.

455
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,580
 He wasn't like, he wasn't a one-man mission of like, proof.

456
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,980
 He also had other stuff to do.

457
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,660
 But he's like, "You know, I'm gonna run into this creature.

458
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,860
 I just know it."

459
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,900
 And I'll prove that Shockey was right.

460
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,620
 And then I'll win his heart.

461
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,820
 So one night, about two weeks later, very short amount of time, Mark Matthews is on patrol

462
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,500
 and he sees something in the bushes.

463
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,100
 A big reptile.

464
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,620
 And he blows it to pieces.

465
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,500
 Doesn't investigate it at all.

466
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,900
 He just shoots it to death.

467
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,500
 Could have been an alien visitor.

468
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,620
 Could have been a last of its species.

469
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,980
 Could have used that magical wand technology to create sparks that would help in the Cold

470
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
 War.

471
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,500
 But he didn't even worry about that.

472
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:03,180
 Those are all the birds flying away from the gunshot.

473
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,300
 Not the sound of this creature dying.

474
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,700
 Now when he shoots it, dead, he walks up to it and he goes, "That's not a frog."

475
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,260
 But I don't know what it is.

476
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,180
 It's four feet tall.

477
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,180
 It's a big dead reptile with arms and legs and a little reptilian head.

478
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 And that was it.

479
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
 No tail.

480
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,860
 And he's like, "What is this thing?"

481
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,940
 So he picks it up, throws it in the back of a squad car in the trunk, takes it to Shaki.

482
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,100
 Now Shaki's at home.

483
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,980
 He's drinking some single malt.

484
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,380
 He's like, "They'll believe me someday.

485
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,900
 I know they'll believe me."

486
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,020
 Or, "I'll show them.

487
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,420
 I'll show them all."

488
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,700
 And before he can enact his plan of vengeance on his bullies, Matthews shows up and says,

489
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,540
 "Hey Shaki, you want to come check out my trunk?"

490
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,700
 Got some junk in it.

491
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,540
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, let's go."

492
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,780
 Opens it up and Shaki looks and he goes, "That is exactly what I saw."

493
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,060
 That stands up on both legs and Matthew goes, "I didn't see it stand up on both legs necessarily,

494
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,420
 but I did blow it away before I'd have the chance to like, you know, Carl Owens out of

495
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
 there."

496
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,620
 So, at this point they're looking at a giant reptile.

497
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
 It's not an alligator.

498
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,860
 It's not a crocodile.

499
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,300
 It's not a frog.

500
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,820
 But it's definitely some sort of unknown creature to them.

501
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,540
 So they have to go take it to get it tested by like a scientist.

502
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,420
 So I imagine in real life they took it to like a college or a vet.

503
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,420
 But I would have loved to see them roll it down into the autopsy room of the police station.

504
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,340
 He's like, "Hey Clark, you ever seen one of these before?"

505
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,140
 And Clark's like, "Oh dude, yeah, I can't wait to dissect this thing and find out what

506
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
 it is."

507
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,900
 Looks like straight-up alien autopsy.

508
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,060
 But anyways, for whatever the reason, whether they took it to the autopsy dude, the coroner

509
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,180
 is the word I'm looking for, or they took it to a veterinarian, what it was, what

510
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:56,220
 Shockey saw and Matthew saw was a giant iguana that's tail had come off.

511
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,380
 So to be fair, it didn't look like an iguana.

512
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,580
 It just looked like a monster.

513
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,740
 And when it was standing up by the side of the road, it was actually preparing to climb

514
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,400
 over the guardrail.

515
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,020
 So it wouldn't be able to walk like that.

516
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,900
 It wouldn't be able to jog down the street like that.

517
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,660
 But it was holding itself up and then fell over.

518
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,780
 And it looked like it was standing on both legs.

519
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,620
 So at that point, the thing is, is like, if you ran in, if this series of events happened

520
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,180
 in any other location, a man says, "Oh dude, I saw like a 4 foot tall lizard walking around

521
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,420
 and fell on the river."

522
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,940
 And then two weeks later, someone blew it away with a shotgun and then said, "Oh, it's an

523
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,500
 iguana with no tail."

524
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,420
 That would kind of be it.

525
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,660
 But this, because it took place in Loveland where the beloved frogman lived, it was this

526
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:47,700
 crazy chain of events. And what's really weird is that outside of that first story, and then

527
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,140
 the story of the officers, there's no other real proof of the frogman.

528
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,500
 There's a few blurry photos of it.

529
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,300
 Really, the best photo that's come out was when some nerds were playing Pokemon Go, running

530
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:07,340
 around in Loveland, and they clipped a picture of a creature standing in the water, looking

531
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,860
 at them with glowing eyes.

532
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:14,540
 Probably most likely fake, because what Pokemon Go player is going to stop playing Pokemon

533
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,020
 Go long enough to open their camera up, none.

534
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,420
 Also, technically they should have caught them, but they didn't.

535
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,620
 So I think it was fake.

536
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,380
 If the Loveland Frog monster, I keep wanting to add that qualifier on the end of it, if

537
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,860
 the Loveland Frog is real, I think the most likely thing is they were simply passing through.

538
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,460
 I find it interesting that they seemed to be monsters, but they were talking to each

539
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,460
 other.

540
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,820
 Oh dude, I just remembered something.

541
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,860
 I did an episode, probably about three episodes back.

542
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,100
 I can't believe that I totally forgot about this.

543
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,100
 I did an episode three, about three or four episodes back, called "The Man Who Was Addicted"

544
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,820
 or "Addicted to Abduction" or "Addicted to UFO Abduction" or something like that.

545
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,740
 And it started this guy, it was featured this guy named Peerzan Fredov, who talked about

546
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,740
 being abducted multiple times and I said the whole story was made up.

547
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,220
 But an interesting thing is when he was abducted on that ship, and that story took place in,

548
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:19,180
 if I remember correctly, in the 70s, he was taken aboard the ship and the aliens were like

549
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,940
 here, look in this vat, this is our most hated enemy.

550
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,620
 And it was a giant frog.

551
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,200
 Now it's possible that Peerzan Fredov still made the whole story up, and he just read

552
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,180
 about the 19th story, the story that took place in the 1950s with the businessman.

553
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,460
 That's actually, it's possible, but I know it's possible, I can't necessarily say unlikely,

554
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,580
 but I would say my instinct tells me that if the loveland frog sighting is real, they

555
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,460
 were aliens.

556
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,680
 They were from not this planet.

557
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:55,820
 Because three four foot tall frogs with magical wands would be really hard to not see until

558
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
 1955.

559
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,240
 There's like stories of like old legends in the areas of frog people, but people think

560
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,640
 that's been retconned.

561
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,940
 It's really hard for three giant frogs to hide with a magic wand, get sighted and then go

562
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,960
 completely off the grid again.

563
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,640
 Unless they were simply passing through, or passing through our planet or dimension.

564
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,240
 I think it's for, and that would be why there would be no more frogmen sightings, because

565
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,640
 they were just there for that night.

566
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,500
 They were partying in the level in Ohio, then they had to get to somewhere else.

567
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,180
 I wonder what, it's funny because when I think of the story, I'm not so curious about the

568
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,260
 frogs because I deal with cryptids all the time.

569
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,420
 I'm curious about that wand.

570
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,820
 Very rarely do we see cryptids wield technology, which again makes me think it's more likely

571
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,580
 that they're alien than some sort of monster.

572
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,900
 You gotta wonder though, we hear these stories of businessmen driving around at night, seeing

573
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,520
 something out of the blue, or out of the black, because it's night.

574
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,440
 They see a bigfoot across the road, they see a man bat in Chicago, they see a loveline

575
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,720
 frog and his buddies on the side of the road.

576
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,240
 But how many of those people don't make it to their destination?

577
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,560
 And all that's ever found is an abandoned car, or a rowboat in the middle of a lake,

578
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,760
 or a house where the tenant just seemed to up and leave, or a little girl goes missing.

579
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,140
 We never hear the start of those urban legends, those cryptid stories, those alien encounters.

580
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,620
 Because the only witness was a victim.
