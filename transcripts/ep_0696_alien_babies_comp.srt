1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 What would you do if you saw someone being attacked on the side of the road?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 He would travel to Colorado to take a look at the story of a young couple sleeping in their bed.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Everything was going fine until the husband woke up and saw an alien making love to his wife, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I'm a walk big gal.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carbender. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys got some cool plans for this weekend. We got a lot of stuff to cover.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 First off, let's take a look at our fanart Friday for today. This actually was one of the pieces of art we used to run in regular rotation way back in the day.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Long time listeners of the show will remember that. This is from Robert Paulson, a really cool, remember his name?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's a really cool Ouija board Dead Rabbit Radio flyer image. Really, really enjoy it Robert. Thank you so much for making this.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Then let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter. Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now. He's not just solid. He's a gas.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It's Mr. Argon. Everyone give a round of applause to Mr. Argon. Argon's a gas, right? I'm pretty sure. I never excelled.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You guys, this might seem like a shocker to you guys, but I never excelled in science in school. Argon might actually be his last name when I mispronounce it.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But anyways, Mr. Argon, I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Mount Laurel, New Jersey.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Mr. Argon is driving this car all the way out to New Jersey. It's June 6th, 2020. And we're in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. It's 2.45pm. It's the middle of the afternoon. We're taking this nice drive down the freeway.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 John Bishop, 54-year-old man, is driving down Interstate 295. Middle of the afternoon. He's just one of many cars traveling down this road.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And he sees off in the distance. Like, he's driving down the Interstate. And he sees off in the distance. He sees a woman, like, struggling on the side of the road.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 "Get off of me! Get off of me!" He can't hear her. He can't hear her. But he's imagining what she's saying. "Get off of me!"

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And he sees a man dragging her. And he drags her over the guardrail and begins to lead her off into the wooded area of the Interstate.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And John... John's kind of like, "Did I just see that? Like, what is going on?" So he starts to slow his truck down, and other vehicles must have seen this as well. But they're continuing to drive on by.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 John pulls his truck over, jumps out, and sure enough, sees this man on top of a woman in the bushes right off of the roadway.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And she just begins scratching this dude's face. John jumps over the guardrail and attacks the dude. So now it's two on one.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Which is the only time when it's okay for two people to beat up one person when the one person's a total pervert.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 John keeps picking this guy up and throwing him to the ground, and the dude's scrambling to his feet.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And John's trying to really not just clobber this dude. He doesn't want to cripple him.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 The fight is on, and they're on this steep hill. And this other guy, the pervert, we're gonna name him, we're gonna name and shame this guy, Donald Kramer Jr.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 To be fair, this is all alleged, right? This is all alleged. I don't want him to be like, "Sir, I am not a creep. I wasn't doing anything creepy to that woman. I was simply kidnapping her.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I don't know why you're thinking I was gonna do anything gross."

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Donald Kramer Jr. 53 years old. We have a clash of the oldies here. 54 versus 53. Punching it, that's actually only 10 years older than me.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 That's not too old, but we have a 54-year-old and a 53-year-old boxing in the woods.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 But our boy, John Bishop, he's not putting up with it. He throws down Donald.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Donald is actually not really good combatant. He keeps falling because the hill's so steep.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And John Bishop picks up a big stick and just pins old Donnie to the ground.

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 At this point, some firefighters are also driving down the road.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There's a house on fire. They're like, "Ah, we've done that. Putting out fires is so lame."

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 They pull over. They see all of this commotion. They get out. They also help hold down Donald Kramer Jr.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 He is arrested and charged with kidnapping and attempted sexual assault.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And when they asked about this, when the police were trying to put this story together, they showed up eventually.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 They're the ones who went out and put out the fire at the house. They're like, "Ah, we always got to do your jobs, firefighters."

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 They showed up and they said, "So what happened? This is creepy."

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 This woman said, "I was just walking down the street. I didn't approach him. I didn't know the guy. I was just walking down the road."

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And he pulled over and grabbed me and threw me into the woods.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And that is when John Bishop happened to see that happen. It was a completely random attack.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Now, I love stories like that. Sometimes I'll get in a groove and I'll just watch YouTube videos of people saving other people.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Find that fascinating. I've done stuff like that in the past, too. I've never jumped out of a car and beat a dude up.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Wait, I'm walking in. Let me back up. I've never jumped out of a car and beat somebody up in a situation like this to like save somebody.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 But I've saved people's lives and stuff like that. I think we all have. I'm talking about converting them to a religion.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I was like, "Oh, I've saved your life, your eternal soul." Just when you live through life, I fought a dog once.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I think I talked about that on the podcast or on a live episode.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Anyways, that's too long of a story to share right here, but I love reading stories like that.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I love seeing stuff like that when people kind of group up to save other people's lives.

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And stories like this always beg the question, what would you do?

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 What would you do if you saw that going on?

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Mr. Argonne, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We are leaving behind New Jersey.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We are headed out to Gresham, Oregon.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 [Burps]

56
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It's January 15th, 1980, 7 p.m.

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Same setup. People are driving down the road, cane drive.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 This woman runs out into the middle of traffic.

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Cars are swerving out of the way. She's screaming. She's panicking.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 People are just driving by her.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 She's waving. Cars are having a break so they don't hit her.

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 She's almost causing an accident and people who get close enough to see her, it is 7 p.m. It's a lot darker.

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But when they're close enough to see her, they see that she's caked in mud.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It kind of looks like she's bloodied.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Suddenly a man runs out of the bushes on the side of the road, grabs her arm and pulls her into the bushes.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Not a single person stops to investigate what just happened.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Let me reiterate. Let me reiterate if you're watching the dishes in the past 30 seconds.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Woman covered in blood, covered in mud, runs into the middle of the street frantically waving her arms.

69
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Cars are swerving out of the way, almost hitting her. She's still freaking out.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 A man runs out of the bushes, grabs her, pulls her back on the bushes. Not a single person stops.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Not a single person calls the police.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 January 16th, the next day, the body of Barbara Tucker, a 19-year-old woman, is found in the shrubs.

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 She's been raped and then she was bludgeoned to death.

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 She was walking to her night classes at Mountain Hood Community College when she was attacked.

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 What's interesting, a long time ago I started doing a promo read for a movie called The Vanished, Starring Anne Haish and The Punisher.

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 It wasn't actually The Punisher, it was the guy who played what's his name, Thomas Jane.

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I did a promo read for it and I came up with a bunch of stories that week about people who had vanished.

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And I had planned on doing these two stories.

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 One where a woman almost vanished but because someone was aware and paying attention, they saved her life.

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And the other one, this woman, was assaulted in plain view, killed the next day and her killer vanished.

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Her killer was never identified.

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It was 7pm, they saw her in the middle of the road, they saw the man who grabbed her dragging her off into the road.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 They never could find who murdered this woman.

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And they saw this man grab her in front of dozens of witnesses.

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I planned on covering it during Vanished Week, but I didn't.

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And it just kind of sat in my folder of stories.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 These two stories, I think they're really interesting, but they just sat there for months and months and months.

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 So why am I covering them today?

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 June 8th, 2021.

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 41 years after Barbara Tucker was raped and murdered.

91
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Robert Plimpton, 58 years old on June 8th, 2021, was just arrested for the murder of Barbara Tucker.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It's so weird, I almost covered the story a long time ago and I definitely would have done an update,

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 but we get the whole story now because the story I was going to tell was they never caught the guy.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Her boyfriend was a suspect for a long time, people thought was it someone she knew, was it a classmate?

95
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Did she accept a ride from somebody and it goes south and then she tried running out of the car?

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 They didn't know, they had no idea who did this.

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Killer simply vanished.

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 June 8th, 2021, Robert Plimpton, 58 years old, was arrested for the murder.

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 How'd they catch him?

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 DNA profile.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 How they're catching all of these really, really old cold cases.

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 They have DNA on the victim and every day more and more people are sending their DNA off to these 23 inmes, his ancestry.coms.

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 This guy's third cousin probably wanted to find out if he was half Cherokee.

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And I'm luckily, like I'm making it sound like the cousin's guilty.

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Luckily, they were able to match this DNA profile and they were able to verify it by getting Robert Plimpton's DNA from him and they were able to verify.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 This is alleged still, but he would have been 16 at the time of the murder.

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So he was a young teenager and he's denying that he did it, so we still don't know.

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But this person did not appear on anyone's radar. Apparently it was a random crime.

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 His wife, he's married now. He has a wife, he has a son.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And the family's like, listen, he's a good guy. Like he could not have done this.

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 He couldn't have done this. Robert Plimpton would not have just randomly attacked this woman.

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Except, except for the fact that Robert Plimpton was actually arrested in 1997 for attempted sodomy and assault.

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 He attacked a woman at random, but a grand jury refused to indict him.

114
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 So that's a legend, right? That is a legend.

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 However, he might be a good guy. That was alleged. He could be falsely accused of these two crimes.

116
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 However, he was convicted three times for fourth degree assault, which is a misdemeanor, kind of a criminal negligence.

117
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 A lot of times it's domestic violence.

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Multiple DUIs and shocker of shocker, Robert Plimpton, who's denying this, has actually been convicted twice of kidnapping.

119
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So how he was out on the street to begin with is bizarre.

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I mean, one kidnapping conviction, that should be your limit, right?

121
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But two kidnapping convictions, multiple DUIs, and he evaded the attempted sodomy and assault thing.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But apparently, allegedly, they caught the man who randomly murdered a young woman and, I'm sorry, no, I'm not sorry.

123
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 The blood of her is also in the hands of everyone who is driving down that road.

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I don't expect you to get out and fight this dude, but call the cops.

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Shine a flashlight in his face. Do something. Do something.

126
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 They assumed it was just a college prank.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You know that good old hazing activity where people run around covered in blood screaming in the middle of traffic?

128
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But it is good that they caught this guy. It's alleged still.

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Legally, it's still a legend, but we will see if they caught the right man.

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Mr. Oregon, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

131
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We are leaving behind Gresham, Oregon. We are headed out to Colorado.

132
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 [imitates car engine]

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 This story is one of those stories that we don't have a lot to go off of.

134
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But I think the implications of it are wide and terrifying.

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 The year is 1972. It's somewhere in Colorado. It's late at night.

136
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And there's a young married couple in bed. We'll call them Johnny is the guy and Maria is his wife.

137
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Things are going okay for this couple, but what they really want to have is a little tiny baby.

138
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 They want to have a little baby person. This is the big struggle in their relationship right now.

139
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 They want a baby. They're trying. They're trying as much as they can.

140
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Johnny's at work and Maria's like, "Hey, you mind if I stop on by?"

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 We try to have that kid. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, sure."

142
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 They're banging constantly, but no baby.

143
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You go to the doctor. The doctor's just shrugging his shoulder. You're banging.

144
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 You're banging each other in front of the doctor. The doctor's like, "That's not going to help."

145
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 You're having sex in the doctor's office. That's not going to mean a baby.

146
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 They're trying really hard. They're doing all the medical stuff, but they can't have a child.

147
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 One night, they're just sleeping in bed.

148
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Johnny wakes up, and he sees two large humanoids standing in the bedroom.

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 His wife's not one of them. His wife is a normal sized human.

150
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 It doesn't describe these guys as grays. It doesn't really explain anything outside of large humanoids.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So it makes me think they're just human looking.

152
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 They don't say they have big bug eyes or eight arms or anything like that.

153
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 They're just human looking people. They're just standing in his room.

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Now, obviously, he's disturbed by this. He only expected one large humanoid tonight.

155
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 He's very unnerved by this, and he's especially unnerved when he realizes he can't move.

156
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He's paralyzed.

157
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Now, some people may go, "He's obviously dreaming, and this is sleep paralysis."

158
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And yes, that would be the skeptical answer.

159
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But if I've addressed that, let's just say that this happened.

160
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Because we don't know either way, right? That's how we do it on the show.

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It's an interesting story we're going to tell it.

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 He's paralyzed. He has all the symptoms of someone who's having a waking dream,

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 but we're just going to ignore that that's a real thing that happens.

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He's paralyzed. There are these two large humanoids standing in his room,

165
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 and one of them is looking at his wife and then crawls on top of his wife.

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And he's laying there. He's like, "Maria! Maria, wake up! Wake up, Maria!"

167
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 But she is dead asleep.

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And the alien begins to bang his wife.

169
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Now, I know what you're thinking. You guys actually probably aren't thinking this.

170
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 But what I'm thinking is, was the alien naked when they appeared in the room?

171
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Because it seems there's a couple steps missing.

172
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 This is how my, you know, Jason, this dude's wife is getting banged next to him while he's paralyzed.

173
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Think about it this way.

174
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 This happened to me. If I was sleeping in bed with my wife, I'm not married, but if I was married,

175
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Britney Spears is dead asleep. I wake up and I'm paralyzed.

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And I see these two dudes standing in my room, these two giant humanoids.

177
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I would describe it like this.

178
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I was about to tell you my erotic slash fiction of me watching Britney Spears getting banged by an alien.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 But no, either I would say, "Yeah, I woke up and I was paralyzed."

180
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And these two giant naked dudes were in my bedroom.

181
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And then one of them climbed on top of the bed and started banging Britney Spears.

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I would make that clear. I would say, "When I woke up, the aliens were naked."

183
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So it obviously, you would assume they're here to do the dirty.

184
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 But no, I imagine they were wearing uniforms of some sort.

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And so they would take it off. They would take off their uniform, right?

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And you would describe that. You would go into great detail.

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 You know what I mean? What I don't understand is how are you paralyzed in this dude's being in your wife?

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Did he take off his clothes?

189
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 For some reason, I'm hung up on that detail.

190
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Because it's totally different if a dude appears in your room and he's naked and he's being in your wife.

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I mean, they're both distressing. They're both distressing.

192
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 But the other one, if he showed up in some like Ash Star Universal Command outfit,

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 and he's taking his medals off, he has to undo all these ornate buttons and stuff like that,

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 he has this holographic belt, he undoes it, and then he's standing there in like eighth dimensional underwear

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and he takes those off too, and then he's being in my wife.

196
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Like, I kind of want to know... I don't know if that detail, I don't know why I'm hung up on that.

197
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Because I think that way it's just kind of creepier, because then you think maybe they just showed up

198
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 to like run some tests and the dude sees how hot Britney Spears is and is like,

199
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 "Hey man, what galactic man does it know?"

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 "It starts banging her wife." Or if they showed up naked, you're like, "Jason, Jason, just finish the story."

201
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Okay, so somehow this alien starts banging this dude's wife. This alien is banging Maria.

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And the other alien is just standing there watching, which that is just a creepy detail

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 that does not need to be added. He's just watching his fellow alien space soldier rail this sleeping woman

204
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and poor Johnny is laying there. He's paralyzed, he can't do anything about it,

205
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 and he hears his wife having an orgasm. She's deeply, deeply pleasured by this alien's love-making.

206
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Johnny just can't do anything, and he's hearing his wife orgasm.

207
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He's like, "Oh, so that's what it sounds like." That's what it sounds like. She really has been faking.

208
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 This alien is just giving it to her good, and then the aliens leave. Again, we don't have any detail of whether or not

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 he put his clothes back on or the alien cuddled with her for a while. We don't really know how he treated her afterwards.

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 But they leave. They just get up and leave. And Johnny can't believe what just happened.

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 But after that, after that encounter, his wife was able to have children.

212
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Johnny and Maria were finally able to conceive children. They ended up having two little baby people to join the family.

213
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 This story was originally presented in Preston Dennett's book, UFO Healing. I got it from thinkabout@docs.com.

214
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 There's a lot of interesting stuff in the story. I'm not going to go back on to the aliens taking their clothes off.

215
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 There's a lot of interesting stuff in the story. But I think there's a very dark element to this.

216
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 This is a book called UFO Healing, and I think there's two ways you can look at it in a positive aspect.

217
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 One is that the aliens were sent down to help relieve her reproductive woes.

218
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 The only way to do that, luckily for the aliens and really, luckily for Maria as well, is for these aliens to have sex with her that gave her tremendous pleasure.

219
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And then she could have babies. You could take it from a sci-fi angle like that.

220
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You could see that maybe these weren't aliens. Maybe they were angels coming down.

221
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Which in that case, you might want to watch your children make sure they don't become giant Nephilim soldiers that cause another great flood.

222
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 It could also be the idea that Johnny really did have this dream.

223
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And what he was really seeing wasn't a physical representation of his wife having sex with these aliens or angels or spirits or whatever they were,

224
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 but some sort of psychic healing going on within her.

225
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Like that was the only way he could kind of see it, but what was really happening was these forces were healing her so she was able to have children.

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps to wrap this week up and take a look at this thing.

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 If you saw your wife getting banged by a space alien, and then you're like, "Jason, let me digest that real quick before you move on to the next thing."

228
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You saw your wife getting banged by a space alien, and then she got pregnant.

229
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Would you think that that child was yours?

230
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Would you go, "Oh man, that alien must have rearranged her womb or something like that by having sex with her, made it so she could have babies."

231
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Or would you think that's a space alien baby?

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It doesn't say how long it took for them to conceive a child.

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 It doesn't say the next day she woke up nine months pregnant with twins.

234
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They just said that later on they could have kids.

235
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So it's not like she immediately got pregnant from this alien, but wouldn't you be a little suspicious of that?

236
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Wouldn't you be a little suspicious of that?

237
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And then I started thinking, conspiracy cap fully on.

238
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Let's take in what we know of the lore.

239
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Aliens do breed with humans.

240
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 We have covered tons of stories on this show of aliens breeding with humans.

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So you have the hybrid program.

242
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Now sometimes these kids are really weird looking, right?

243
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 They look like gray alien.

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They look like hybrid between a gray alien and a human.

245
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 That's exactly what they look like.

246
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And they're floating around in space because they would just be too obvious to have here on Earth.

247
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But then every so often you see a human.

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I'm not being mean to this person.

249
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I think she's one of the most beautiful women ever.

250
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Anya Taylor Joy, she doesn't look human in a good way.

251
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 She looks like a space alien, doesn't she?

252
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So in a good way.

253
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Jason, there's no good way to say you're not from this planet.

254
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 She, I mean, listen, my heart belongs to Britney Spears.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 She's absolutely gorgeous.

256
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But I also love Britney Spears personality.

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I love the fact that I'm afraid she might stab me in the neck while I'm sleeping.

258
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But I'm sure she also makes really good scrambled eggs.

259
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Anya Taylor Joy, she looks ethereal in her beauty.

260
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 She doesn't look human.

261
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 She's just gorgeous.

262
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 But, you know, she could have the personality of wallpaper.

263
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I don't know.

264
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But she's physically gorgeous.

265
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So someday I'll get to know her.

266
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But for right now, I don't know.

267
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I'm not going to pin my hopes on her.

268
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I wonder how many, this is what I'm getting at.

269
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 This is a fashion review show.

270
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Here's what I'm getting at.

271
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 What if there are way more alien human hybrids out there than we know of?

272
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Like we hear about the ones that are real weird looking,

273
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 like with the big gray alien heads and they're floating around and people are drawing pictures of them.

274
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And they're like, this is what my kid looks like.

275
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And it's just a picture of some busted up child.

276
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 But what if there's, what if this thing, like Johnny woke up to see this happening?

277
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What if this happens all the time?

278
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 What if aliens are constantly banging chicks on Earth and getting them pregnant?

279
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And if the alien looks too much like an alien, they take it to space.

280
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But if an alien has that perfect blend of human, like mostly human looking, but a little bit of alien,

281
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 they leave them on Earth.

282
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 What if there's way more human hybrids out there than we can think of?

283
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I'm not saying like 50% of humans, I'm not saying 10% of humans or 1% of humans,

284
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 but even like 0.25% of humans, or less, are actually alien human hybrids.

285
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And they don't know it.

286
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 The parents don't know it.

287
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I'm not talking about those indigo children thing.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The people are always claiming to be indigo children.

289
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 They're special, they got special powers and stuff like that.

290
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I'm talking about these people appear to be human by every metric, but they're actually part alien.

291
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And nobody knows it.

292
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And they're not here for some grand cosmic thing to lead us to the next ascension or even some sort of invasion process.

293
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 It's just the byproduct of pervert scientists from another planet.

294
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Seeing if they can do it.

295
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 There doesn't have to be this grand conspiracy, this grand scheme.

296
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It could literally just be an explorer coming to a undiscovered country and banging the population.

297
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 That happens all the time on Earth.

298
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 It's not like they were like, "Oh, let's see if we can create this new culture."

299
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 They're like, "No, we're just going to start banging these really hot women."

300
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 We've never been to this island, we're leaving in a couple weeks anyways.

301
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 We're going to bang all these hot women, we're going to leave.

302
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 They weren't doing it for any sort of real reason.

303
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 It was just human horniness.

304
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And you just have this on an alien level.

305
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 These two aliens, their mission wasn't to find a hot woman and have sex with her.

306
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That was just something they did on their way to mutilating some cow buttholes.

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We always talk about stuff like, "Oh, if people found out aliens existed, religions would collapse."

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I don't think so.

309
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I think religions would all start fighting over who got to preach to them first.

310
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I think is what you would see.

311
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Oh, the world economy would collapse.

312
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It wouldn't be the easiest to go.

313
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It would depend if the aliens are coming in peace, if they show up, if we have to say that they exist,

314
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 or they make themselves know.

315
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And obviously if there's some sort of galactic battle, you know, if the economy's going to tank, we get that.

316
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 But as far as alien disclosure, like admitting aliens exist, how would affect the economy?

317
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 How would you go to work if you knew that Alpha Centauri was fully populated by grays?

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Probably. You'd probably still go to your job with a footlocker.

319
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 What if it's not that big?

320
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 What if it's not just about disclosing that aliens are out there?

321
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And you could say, "Yeah, the aliens have abducted some people over time."

322
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And you know, we told, we said, "Don't do that."

323
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Yeah, the aliens can disarm our nuclear weapons, so, you know, it's kind of hard to sleep at night knowing they're more powerful than us.

324
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But what if it's like, "Yes, aliens exist. They can do all those stuff."

325
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And they have been interbreeding with us against our will.

326
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 That is a whole other different game, because we know people get kidnapped.

327
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I covered two stories where people were getting kidnapped in this.

328
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 We know people get kidnapped.

329
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 We know people would get abducted by aliens, and they could say, "Yeah, over the course of 50 years, 400 people have been abducted."

330
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Most people would go, "Well, that sucks. That sucks for those 400 people, but what are you going to do?"

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But what if it turns out that these aliens are constantly banging human women and their bloodline, alien DNA, is in parts of the human population?

332
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 That would panic people.

333
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 If it turned out that the Tic Tac UFO was actually from another planet, people, a lot of people would just say, "I told you so."

334
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And then other people would go, "Whoa, that's amazing."

335
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And you'd have some panic, but it wouldn't be the end of the world.

336
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 If it turned out that when you go to sleep, there is a chance that an alien is going to bang you, and there's nothing we can do about it.

337
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 People don't--people won't care that these vehicles can disappear from radar.

338
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It'd be a totally different ballgame.

339
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 It's possible that disclosure isn't because they're afraid of what humans will do on a global scale because of an economic fallout or a religious fallout,

340
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 but because of a raw personal anger towards them.

341
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Aliens exist and--and they've been sexually assaulting women.

342
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Women who are unconscious have been having sex with aliens.

343
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And there are members of the human population that are the children of this unholy union.

344
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 If that information would be far more devastating to the human psyche than just there is alien life out in the universe.

345
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Because not only would you start suspecting that people around you may be part-alien,

346
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 you would start to wonder if your own children were part-alien.

347
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It would be devastating.

348
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 It's one thing to think that aliens have technology that can enter our airspace, shut down our nuclear bombs,

349
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 fly at unheard of speeds, and then disappear in the blink of an eye.

350
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 It's another thing to think that at any moment an alien can enter your bedroom and rape your wife.

351
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 They say the truth is out there, but it could be the truth is too awful to even imagine.

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
