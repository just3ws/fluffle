1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 For the first time, the thoughts of a dying man are recorded.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,560
 What does science have to say about our last moments on Planet Earth?

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,700
 Then we travel to Mississippi in the 1950s to take a look at a bizarre disease that quickly

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,840
 spread throughout the state.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,500
 Is there any truth to the story of women being driven to homicidal violence simply because

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,280
 they smelled a man?

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:41,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,220
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,100
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,040
 First off, let's go ahead and introduce our newest Patreon supporter, flying into Dead

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,160
 Rabbit Command as himself.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,440
 Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
 Give it up for Propeller.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,440
 Weeeeee!

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
 We're all riding on him.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
 We're spinning around getting sick.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
 Propeller, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,520
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,120
 Just help spread the word about the show.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
 Really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
 We got flyers on the show notes you can print out.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,840
 Feel free to graffiti bathrooms all over the place.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,040
 Dead Rabbit Radio, let's get the word out and let's get this show to grow.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
 Propeller, I'm going to go ahead and attach you onto the front of the Jason Jet.

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,240
 You don't get to fly it.

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,000
 You get to hit all the windforces.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,120
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,000
 We are headed all the way out to a hospital.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,760
 Probably need to take a jet to go to a local hospital, but...

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
 *Sigh*

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
 *Sigh*

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
 *Sigh*

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 *Sigh*

37
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
 Flying around out there.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
 Weeeeee.

39
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,040
 We all say as we're in this jet.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880
 The reason why we're headed to this hospital, this is actually a really popular story,

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,500
 but it's breaking news and I wanted to cover it because I have my own conspiracy theories

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,080
 about it, but you guys might have heard of this before.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,800
 So what has happened over the weekend?

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,360
 This medical journal released this report.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,520
 Apparently they're saying that they had recorded a human brain dying for the first time.

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,000
 Now let's put a little pin in that.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,200
 Let's put a little pin in that brain there for a second, because I got a lot to say about

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
 this.

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 What?

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
 Let's look at what happened right here.

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,120
 We don't really know, scientifically we don't really know what happens in the brain when

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
 you're dying.

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,160
 We do know that it stops working right when you die and your heart stops beating.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,400
 It starts pumping blood into the brain, the brain loses oxygen and you're dead.

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,160
 That's been the common knowledge for a long, long time.

56
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,720
 Now a while back, I don't know if I can find this article again, I'll start looking for

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,280
 it, but a while back I remember I was reading this thought piece saying we don't know, like

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,280
 legitimately, this like last year and even in 2021 they go we don't know what death is.

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,760
 We really don't know at what point, well we know what death is, but we don't know when,

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,920
 only when you go from being alive to being dead.

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
 And if you're, you know, dying, right, there's no way to reverse it, it doesn't really matter,

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,320
 but they're thinking of it in the terms of organ donation.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,040
 This article basically stated that we may be taking organs out of people while they

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 are still alive.

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,080
 Now they are not able to be saved at this point.

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,920
 It's not like they'll sit up as they're pulling your heart out to give to some young girl

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,040
 and he's like, "No, I still need that."

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,240
 You were going to die.

69
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,680
 The question is, were you dead when they were removing your organs?

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,000
 And you would have been dead in 15 minutes anyways, right?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,040
 You wanted to survive whether or not you kept your organs, but definitely having your organs

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
 removed, spread the process up.

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,760
 And this was a thing, how long does the brain survive after you are quote unquote dead?

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,280
 This has been something that science has been looking at and people who work in the organ

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,160
 harvesting industry have been worried about.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,360
 And so this time, what happened with this story was there is a guy who was 87 years

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
 old, he has a history of epilepsy.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,320
 He fell down and he hit his brain, well technically he hit his skull, which did some brain damage

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,600
 and he began having terrible bleeding of the brain.

80
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,560
 So he's taken to the emergency room, he's hooked up to all of this EEG stuff.

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
 Doot, doot, doot.

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,160
 Actually that's a hard thing, but anyways, there's medical noises going on.

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,960
 And he's hooked up to this EEG and they're trying to save him.

84
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,840
 And he goes into a coma and they can't reverse it.

85
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,240
 They're like, well, it's unfortunate, but you know, 87 year old man, he lived a good

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
 life.

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,640
 I don't know if doctors actually talk like that, but I hopefully he did live a good

88
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,480
 long life.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
 And they are continuing to kind of go about their business.

90
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,040
 And what they don't realize is the EEG is left on.

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,000
 So he has already had a heart attack, he's already stopped pumping blood and he's dead.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,400
 And later on, the technicians in the hospital realized that his EEG continued to record

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,240
 for 15 minutes after he died.

94
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,680
 For 30 seconds before the heart attack happened, and for 30 seconds after the heart attack,

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,320
 we saw this patient's brain light up with gamma ray brain rhythms.

96
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,240
 30 seconds before the heart attack started and 30 seconds after his heart stopped.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
 So it's like it knew it was coming.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,480
 Gamma ray brain rhythms popped up in his brain.

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,760
 And what that is, is that is the part of our brain that is activated during meditation,

100
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,200
 during dreaming, during memories.

101
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:41,360
 So he had a good minute left in his life where that part of his brain activated.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,320
 They believe that this is the story of the life flashing before your eyes phenomenon.

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,480
 Because this isn't just memories like what did I eat for breakfast or did Jason really

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,880
 sing a song on yesterday's episode.

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,640
 It is your important memories, your deep memories, your happy memories.

106
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,000
 Now we've seen this before in dying rats.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
 We've studied it, we've killed rats and we've hooked up this little EEG to them.

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,400
 And they remember their first piece of cheese, the first time they outwitted that nasty cat.

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,280
 But we've never seen it in a human before.

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,480
 So we think now this is what happens when you're dying, your brain, your brain, and

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
 my brain, all humans' brains will do this.

112
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,920
 They'll have a good minute of reliving your best memories.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,400
 They continue to record, because again this was accidental, they didn't mean to do this.

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,080
 Apparently for up to 15 minutes after his death, his brain was still active.

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,360
 But it wasn't active in the sense like oh no, I'm dead, what am I doing here, oh my

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,960
 god they're taking out my organs, my liver, I still need that.

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,760
 It wasn't active on that level.

118
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,240
 I don't want to dissuade people from being organ donors.

119
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,200
 I think being an organ donor is a very, very important thing because it's just biological

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 matter.

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,920
 It's just your soul, your spirit.

122
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,080
 Who cares what happens to your liver and your corneas and all that stuff.

123
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,640
 Give them to other people.

124
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
 Give them to other people.

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,480
 So I don't want to dissuade that, but at the same time your brain is still active for

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,960
 15 minutes after he was declared dead.

127
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,480
 And so this is something that organ donor scientists have been like should we wait 15

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 minutes, right?

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 Should we wait longer?

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
 There's no way to resuscitate this guy.

131
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 He was dead.

132
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
 He had a heart attack.

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
 His brain was full of blood.

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,680
 He was dead and his heart stopped and he was clinically dead, but now we know for up to

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,120
 15 minutes afterwards he's still having something firing in his brain.

136
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,280
 They do caution.

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
 They do say this.

138
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,320
 Listen, this dude had epilepsy.

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,760
 This is the very first time we've ever done this.

140
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,840
 And we'll put a pin in that as well.

141
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,200
 I know I keep putting pins in stuff.

142
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,160
 This is the very first time we've ever done this, but this guy has epilepsy.

143
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,280
 So it's possible that his brain was firing in a different way.

144
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,160
 It's possible that not everyone's brain does this.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
 He may be the only one.

146
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
 We don't know.

147
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 We haven't studied this.

148
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,800
 But as far as we can tell right now, when you die for 30 seconds before and 30 seconds

149
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,960
 after, you get a flood of memories.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,480
 These gamma ray brain rhythms activate.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 Beautiful story, right?

152
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
 I believe in life after death.

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,000
 I also believe that there's probably a nice little send off whether or not you've been

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 tortured for the past 15 hours by some rival gang, or you just died in your sleep, or you

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,120
 were decapitated, or you're falling off a cliff.

156
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,920
 I believe at the moment that you die, regardless of the lead up to it, I do believe it's a

157
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,600
 moment of peace.

158
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,840
 But I do not believe for one second that this is the first time this has ever been recorded.

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,440
 I 100% believe that this has been done before.

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 Not by these guys.

161
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,240
 I'm not accusing these guys of having a body form.

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,640
 But you're trying to tell me since the invention of the EEG, in any country in the world, whether

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,920
 it was run by a madman dictator, or just a regular dictator, just a politician, whatever,

164
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,480
 where you had some scientist did not run this experiment before.

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
 I 100% don't believe that it probably hasn't been published before.

166
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
 You're telling me that they've never done this before.

167
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,240
 No one's ever hooked up an EEG to someone who was dying and left it on.

168
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,560
 There are so many scientists out there who would love to run this experiment, right?

169
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,000
 Who they get apparently, apparently they're super villains.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,160
 But you're telling me that there's not a scientist working in some fourth world nation,

171
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,120
 some total cesspool, where they're paying off a dictator and saying I'm going to take

172
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
 townspeople here and I'm gonna hook them up to this EEG and I'm gonna inject them with

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,240
 this venom and then having snakes biting them with snakes and then I'm testing it.

174
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 You know what I mean?

175
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
 Like, here's my thing.

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
 This is my conspiracy theory.

177
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,760
 For every reputable, for every 1000 reputable scientists, there's one mad scientist.

178
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,440
 I bet you, I don't know if it's back any of this up, but I bet you someone has done this

179
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
 before, 100%.

180
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,440
 I bet, and I'm not saying they necessarily have to work for Cobra Commander and they're

181
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,520
 killing the patients.

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,920
 But I bet you, I cannot believe this is the first time that's ever happened.

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,840
 Because listen man, if I went to school for years, I was curious about science and stuff

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,560
 like that, I would totally, I totally would have done this already, right?

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,440
 I would have went to work at a hospital and would have worked the night shift when it's

186
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,280
 super spooky and more people are likely to die, especially when I'm working.

187
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,200
 And I would have walked around with this EEG box and you know, I'd be like, dude, are you

188
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 okay?

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 Are you okay?

190
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
 And I'm like, oh, this dude's totally gonna die.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,240
 And I'd hook it up and then, you know, put a pillow over his face or something like

192
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,760
 that and then get my readings and leave.

193
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,160
 You see how easy it is?

194
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,080
 No, I just came up with that off the top of my head.

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,240
 You're telling me that no scientist has ever recorded a person dying before.

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,920
 I don't believe that.

197
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,000
 I do not believe that.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,080
 I believe there, like the Soviet Union that when Stalin was in charge, he was trying to

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,040
 get monkeys to have sex with women.

200
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
 You don't think he ever goes, oh, I wonder what happened.

201
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
 I wonder when people die.

202
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,200
 Let's just kill a bunch of people.

203
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,640
 I'm doing that anyways.

204
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,080
 And why don't we hook them up to brainwave things?

205
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,960
 Like you cannot tell me this is the first time that happened.

206
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,280
 However, however, my conspiracy theory aside, there have absolutely no proof to back up,

207
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
 but it makes sense, right?

208
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,480
 You're telling me a scientist has never murdered somebody to find out what happens after they

209
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
 die.

210
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,320
 Anyways, it's a cool story otherwise, right?

211
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,720
 Like forgetting that, forgetting me besmirching all science endeavors.

212
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 This is really cool.

213
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
 Like we actually do get to see that.

214
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,680
 And it's funny because two people like me who think that death, the lead up to death may

215
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,240
 be chaotic, but death itself is very painless and transitory.

216
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
 This kind of backs it up, right?

217
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,960
 You'll have a good minute of dreaming.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,600
 And a minute long dream could seem like 10 lifetimes.

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,760
 And then to people who don't believe in the afterlife to go, oh, that's where all the

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
 stories like near death experiences and stuff like come from.

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 You're just dreaming.

222
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,280
 But really, when you die, you just kind of disappear.

223
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,480
 Your soul just kind of vanishes.

224
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,280
 So I mean, depending on where you fall on that scale, it can back up either theory.

225
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,280
 If you're some sort of lunatic doctor who's been doing this on the side all the time,

226
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,800
 now you can be like, aha, my calculations were correct.

227
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,120
 Those 19 people that I killed also proved this.

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,280
 But yeah, you can't tell me this is the first time this has happened.

229
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
 Really, you can't.

230
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
 I refuse.

231
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,920
 If you email me with that as a subject line, I will not read it.

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
 I refuse to hear any different.

233
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,040
 Propeller, let's attach you to the top of the carboner copter.

234
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,840
 We are leaving behind this mad scientist laboratory.

235
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,880
 We are headed all the way out to Europe.

236
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,440
 I wonder how many mad scientists there actually are in the world.

237
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,760
 It'll be super easy, right?

238
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,200
 Like you just go to somewhere where life is cheap.

239
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,360
 You got some money and you walk in and you tell the government, hey, I want to start

240
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 chopping up people.

241
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,880
 We probably aren't that bold, but there's a lot of places life are cheap.

242
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,480
 And the EEG machine probably doesn't cost that much either.

243
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,880
 And you just end up in some other country and you're like wiping the sweat off your head

244
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,160
 as you see all the citizens walk around and you're like, oh, their brains is so active.

245
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 But not for long.

246
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,760
 And then you like walk slowly into the crowd of people.

247
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
 But while that totally true and totally not made up, ending to a movie I just wrote in

248
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
 my head is happening.

249
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
 We're in Europe.

250
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 It's actually the 1950s and it's a cold winter.

251
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,040
 We're all bundled up in our furs, got big old hats on and boots and nothing else.

252
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,440
 No pants, no shirts.

253
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,440
 We're walking through this unnamed European village.

254
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 And there's a guy.

255
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
 He's walking through town.

256
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,560
 We'll call him Lance.

257
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,480
 He's walking along this seaside village.

258
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
 Life's pretty good, right?

259
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
 It's the 1950s.

260
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 It's Europe.

261
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,240
 Things were a little rough a couple of years ago during the World War, but now you know

262
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,000
 things are starting to make sense.

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,720
 But Lance is having kind of a weird day as he's walking through town.

264
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 What's that smell?

265
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 Hmm.

266
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 I don't know what it is.

267
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,920
 Well, you might as well just keep walking around.

268
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,560
 It's not like we've invented bathing or anything like that.

269
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,840
 Lance is walking through town and even he can tell he's emitting a strange odor.

270
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,640
 He's been to the doctor a couple of times to get this checked out because it's just

271
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 this weird scent about him.

272
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,160
 No one likes to smell.

273
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
 It's not necessarily off-putting.

274
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,160
 It's just kind of a weird stench.

275
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
 He goes to the doctors and they don't know what it is.

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,160
 They go, "You might have some sort of new disease."

277
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,720
 I mean, that's not really reassuring, right?

278
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,760
 They can't really do anything for it.

279
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,320
 It's not really responding to any medicine and Lance is just like, "Does it hurt?"

280
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,760
 Lance is like, "No, I mean, it's just weird smelling like stuff."

281
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,080
 Right?

282
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
 So Lance is walking through town.

283
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,120
 He's gonna smell you later and he's walking through town and he walks past this group of

284
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
 women.

285
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
 You know, Lance is young.

286
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,200
 You know, he's in his prime.

287
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,520
 He sees these women walk by and he kind of looks to them and they kind of look back at

288
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,600
 him and he's like, "I still got it."

289
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,160
 He's walking down the street.

290
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,480
 He stops at a window of a bakery and he's like, "Oh dude, that cake looks delicious."

291
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,560
 I'm hungry enough to eat an entire wedding cake.

292
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,920
 He looks back and those two women that he had passed, they're kind of like staring

293
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
 at him now.

294
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,240
 He's like, "I know that I got it, but I didn't know I got it that good."

295
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,680
 Those women are staring.

296
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,200
 When he looks back into the bakery at the cake, the female employees of that bakery are kind

297
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 of just staring at him too.

298
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,280
 But it's not lust in their eyes that he sees.

299
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 It's anger.

300
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,080
 It's hate.

301
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,240
 It's really.

302
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,280
 Lance continues walking down the street and the women come out of the bakery, start following

303
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,680
 him.

304
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,800
 Two women he passed earlier are following him.

305
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,960
 And as he continues to walk down the street, he sees more and more women stopping what

306
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,080
 they're doing and following him.

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:28,520
 Car drives by, window rolled down, he sees the woman driving up.

308
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,200
 Take a smell of something.

309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,640
 She puts the car in park, gets out and joins the crowd of women who are following Lance

310
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
 through this village.

311
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,800
 He has no idea what's going on.

312
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,440
 He doesn't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

313
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,080
 Who doesn't want to be followed by a bunch of women?

314
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 Well, Lance.

315
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,920
 Because of what is about to happen.

316
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,640
 He turns the corner, he nearly bumps into this woman and he looks up at her.

317
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:06,160
 She looks at him and he sees her face flash from surprise to hate to rage.

318
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,560
 And she reaches up and she scratches his face deep and hard.

319
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:18,160
 He grabs his cheek, he stumbles backwards into the crowd of women who had been following

320
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,260
 him.

321
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,420
 They begin to scratch him as well.

322
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,580
 They begin to slap him.

323
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,400
 They begin to punch him.

324
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:35,040
 And he feels dozens of hands pulling him, yanking him, tearing at him, ripping his clothing.

325
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
 He pushes away.

326
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,520
 He knows this is a fight for his life.

327
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,360
 He doesn't understand why.

328
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,200
 And he understands that if he does not get out of this crowd of women, they will kill

329
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,840
 him.

330
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,320
 He begins running through the seaside village and the women pursue him.

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
 They're gaining ground on him.

332
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,720
 Every time he passes a store that has the door open, women pour out of it.

333
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,160
 The men of the seaside village have no idea what's going on.

334
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
 Is Beetlemania come?

335
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
 They don't even know where the beetles are.

336
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
 This is free beetles.

337
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
 They're just watching this young man run down the street.

338
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 And women.

339
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 What is that?

340
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
 Is that my wife running after that guy?

341
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
 What is going on?

342
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 Martha, come back.

343
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 Never mind.

344
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
 You can go do what you want.

345
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
 I'm going to go back to the bar.

346
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,880
 These women are chasing this young man through the streets of the seaside village and he's

347
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 desperate.

348
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,000
 Every time he passes an alley, every time he passes a storefront, every time he walks

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 by any open door, it seems that there's a woman standing there and they're transformed

350
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,920
 into a bloodlusten animal.

351
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,080
 At the edge of the seaside village is the sea.

352
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,600
 And he makes a quick calculation.

353
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
 It's winter.

354
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,760
 It's super cold, but surely if I jump into the water, surely and her friends won't follow

355
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,160
 me.

356
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 So he does.

357
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:13,960
 He runs and he jumps into that freezing water and without hesitation, every woman who smelled

358
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:22,720
 his scent follows him in to the icy depths.

359
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,000
 All of them die in the frigid waters of this European seaside village.

360
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,040
 Let's travel to Mississippi in the year 1956.

361
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:43,400
 A story starts to go around in this state of a new disease that sprouted up in Europe

362
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,960
 that made its way over to the states called myrcritus.

363
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,560
 It is a disease that only can infect men, but it has an effect on women.

364
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:02,920
 If a man gets myrcritus, he puts off a scent that for whatever reason, nobody knows triggers

365
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,280
 a woman to become a homicidal maniac.

366
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,080
 Just the scent of whatever odor they're putting out overrides any self-preservation, any rational

367
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 thought.

368
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,840
 The woman will kill and continue to kill until she is removed from the area that is producing

369
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,080
 the scent.

370
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,040
 Even if she kills a man as his body is laying there, as his mind is still firing for 15

371
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,920
 minutes, she will continue to attack and destroy things in the area.

372
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,000
 Now let's say a young boy passes by, she may attack him.

373
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,880
 Whether or not he's putting out the scent, he's close enough to the scent that she will

374
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 murder him.

375
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,680
 Now apparently, they didn't murder each other.

376
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,720
 Women would not murder each other during these rages.

377
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
 So if you had a single body who was emitting this odor and you had a bunch of women clawing

378
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,160
 at a man and then picking up a brick and smashing his brains in as he's laying there dying,

379
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,720
 as long as his body is still emitting the odor, the homicidal rage is there but never

380
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,280
 turned on each other.

381
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:12,760
 So this is one of those very, very interesting, very, very obscure local urban legends that

382
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,360
 a lot of people believe has a nugget of truth in it.

383
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,320
 Locally people consider this an urban legend.

384
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,520
 It's one of those urban legends that people go, "Well, maybe it's not as bad as people

385
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,120
 say but it was real.

386
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
 It actually did happen."

387
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
 And then the people are like, "Oh no, it is an urban legend."

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,120
 And they're like, "Ah, no, you weren't there back in 1956, young man."

389
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,520
 Apparently there was a time where people believed that mercritus was a real disease and it would

390
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,080
 cause women to kill on sight.

391
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,240
 Or smell.

392
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 Kill on smell.

393
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,720
 They wouldn't stop killing until the smell was removed.

394
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:56,000
 Some versions of the story say that a man can give himself mercritus, I have no idea

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 why you would want to do this.

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,360
 And the way to do it was to ingest large quantities of lead.

397
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,000
 So first off, why would you want to give yourself this scent?

398
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,360
 And secondly, why would you ingest large quantities of lead for any reason, right?

399
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,840
 It's not edible, it's not tasty, I'm assuming.

400
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,720
 But whether or not lead is the cause of this because they didn't mention that in the Euro

401
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,040
 story, he was like, "Oh, I just got out of the restaurant drinking a nice cup of lead."

402
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,480
 Why do I smell?

403
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,320
 Some people say that lead can cause this.

404
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,760
 Other people go, "No, it's not caused by lead because that's stupid.

405
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,600
 Right now one drinks a lot of lead."

406
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,160
 You know, old timers in Mississippi go, "No, this is a real thing.

407
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,000
 Back in 1956 there was this thing called mercritus and there was an unnamed Mississippi town where

408
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 this started in.

409
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,280
 And the violence became so bad.

410
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,240
 The women killed everyone in that town."

411
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,600
 And some versions of the story say that mercritus outbreak was so bad it actually swept through

412
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,160
 several southern U.S. states.

413
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,280
 But none of this is in a history book, right?

414
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,640
 I just heard about this and I've been investigating urban legends and paranormal stuff for 20

415
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,440
 some odd years.

416
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
 This is awesome.

417
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
 This is dope.

418
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
 This is dope.

419
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,720
 I've never heard of this before.

420
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,920
 Mercritus, a disease that the lead part is stupid, but a disease that can turn a woman

421
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,000
 insane turn her into a homicidal maniac, bloodlustin killer.

422
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,040
 And what's interesting too is the pushback.

423
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
 People have to come out.

424
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,240
 Usually when there's urban legends about Three-Legged Lady Road or Crybaby Bridge or whatever,

425
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
 people don't come out and have to issue statements saying that's not true.

426
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,120
 I've read documents from nurses have come out and said the health agency says that

427
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
 this is impossible.

428
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,840
 Like why is the health agency, why are you as a nurse opining on this as well if it's

429
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 not real?

430
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,800
 I find it so interesting that this exists, that this story exists.

431
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,960
 And here's the thing.

432
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,240
 Just like in the first story, this is something that would be covered up.

433
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,600
 This is something that would be covered up.

434
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,040
 And this would be something that I could see somebody trying to invent.

435
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,240
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here and we're going to wrap it up like this.

436
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,760
 I honestly believe, this is one of my personal conspiracies, I think that there is a race

437
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,240
 between men and women to obsolete out the other one.

438
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
 I've honestly believed that for a long time.

439
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,920
 I don't think I've ever talked about it on this show.

440
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:36,720
 I think that for the longest time, men have been dependent on women to keep the species

441
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,240
 going and same thing with women barely barely get along with each other in a lot of ways.

442
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,360
 You'll get to the point where you can have a society with nothing but women, you can

443
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,920
 have a society nothing but men.

444
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
 But we won't have both.

445
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,320
 I'm not saying that that's a good outcome for humanity, but I do believe that there are

446
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,200
 forces working on both sides to ensure that is the case.

447
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,920
 We work together hand in hand now, but once we're able to develop technology where we

448
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,480
 can have babies without a womb or without an egg, then the men will annihilate all of

449
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
 the women on the planet.

450
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,200
 And if women can figure out a way to have babies without men and the science, we're seeing

451
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,520
 science try to figure this out.

452
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,840
 The men have figured out a way to create an egg now.

453
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,840
 They actually can take skin cells from someone and create an egg as of right now to propagate

454
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,000
 the human species women are not needed.

455
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,880
 The technology is very, very expensive, but it is no longer hypothetical.

456
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,800
 I do, I'm not, again, I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I think there are forces

457
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,160
 in the male side and there are forces in the female side, whether that be some sort of

458
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,680
 Illuminati type thing or what I don't know, but I do believe that there has been a race,

459
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,320
 a scientific race to obsolete out the other sex.

460
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:08,480
 And they will then over time wipe out women or over time wipe out men.

461
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
 There will be one sex in the future.

462
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,520
 Because why have two? If you are a man and you can do everything you need to do and it's

463
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,600
 only with men, why would you want another half or more, there's more women on earth

464
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,200
 than there are men, of someone that you can quasi relate to?

465
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,280
 You know, I'm always fascinated that men and women can even date because their experiences,

466
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,280
 the way they view the world are so radically different.

467
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,480
 I'm always very, very fascinated by the fact that we can have intimate relations with each

468
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,880
 other because really we don't see the world the same.

469
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,480
 We've had totally different, I'm not talking about chemically, we have had totally different

470
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
 experiences.

471
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,800
 I'm not saying this brain works different than this brain, I'm saying society treated

472
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:06,000
 this person different than this person radically different and then we meet again in our 20s

473
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,800
 and we start dating and it's super weird that it works.

474
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,520
 Because when I meet women my age, and I'm 45, when I meet women my age, we've had radically

475
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,400
 different lives, but when I was meeting women in my 20s, we had radically different lives

476
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,480
 and when I was hanging out with my friends who were girls and we were 12, we had radically

477
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
 different lives.

478
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 Now I don't like cars, I'm not into cars, I'm not into sports, I'm not into a lot of

479
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,840
 stuff that is macho type stuff.

480
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,520
 But I can still sit down with any man and we've shared so many of the same life experiences

481
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,680
 by just being men.

482
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,920
 Even though 90% of men culture I'm really not a part of.

483
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,520
 Guys will often try to talk to me about cars and I was like I don't know what you're talking

484
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
 about.

485
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,920
 They'll talk to me about sports, I don't know what you're talking about, but we've still

486
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,680
 had so many other shared experiences.

487
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,440
 I'm not saying this is a good thing, I want to be clear, I'm not saying I want to get

488
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,120
 wiped off the planet or I want to wipe women off the planet, but I don't think the future

489
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,800
 is both.

490
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 I don't.

491
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,560
 I think there are a lot of women out there that if they could hit a button and wipe men

492
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,120
 off the face of the earth, because now they have perfected the way to keep the human race

493
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,200
 going without us, they would.

494
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,880
 And I know there are a lot of men who would do the same thing if that button was sitting

495
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,560
 there and it would wipe out women, knowing that the human species would continue on.

496
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,760
 You could press a button, you could remove half of it, and then you'd have a group of

497
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,320
 people that either a brotherhood or a sisterhood.

498
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,200
 100% believe that there are agencies working towards that.

499
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,520
 I'm not saying the big ones are, I'm not saying the powers that be, or the Illuminati or the

500
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,160
 13 families or anything like that are fighting for that, but I do believe that there are

501
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:00,080
 groups of mad scientists on either side who would love to have something like Merkitis

502
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,160
 be real.

503
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
 Because it's a hard thing.

504
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,520
 See obviously I don't want to go out and wipe out all the women on earth, and most women

505
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,880
 don't want to wipe out all the men on earth, but you would only need a group of people

506
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,920
 at the top who have the technology to do this that could override our natural, "Ah yeah,

507
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,560
 we don't always get along, but you know, I like girls.

508
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
 I like girls."

509
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,920
 Like even not just in a relationship thing.

510
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,200
 Like I don't have a problem with them in my day to day life.

511
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,400
 How do you overwrite all that stuff?

512
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,680
 "Oh you know, yeah sure, boys have broken my heart a couple of times, but you know,

513
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
 they're not that bad.

514
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,480
 It would be horrible to live in a world without boys."

515
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,040
 How do you overwrite that natural thing?

516
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
 Merkitis.

517
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
 Right?

518
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,840
 If you could trigger something in women that would just make them kill men, and you triggered

519
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,000
 something in men that made them give off a scent that drove women mad, there you go.

520
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,080
 Now this was being tested, this was being released in the 1950s, possibly as a dry run to see

521
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,400
 how long it could go to watch it spread.

522
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,440
 They didn't have the technology to ever unleash this.

523
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,160
 I mean again, assuming it's not an urban legend that's not totally made up, conspiracy

524
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,480
 caps on, they can unleash this as a dry test, a dry run, and then shut it off, make sure

525
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,760
 it didn't escape too far out, and then wait.

526
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 Wait.

527
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,680
 They did have the technology to breed without men, and once that technology is there, and

528
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,080
 it is there, now, you could start making moves.

529
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:36,280
 Whether or not that's creating viruses that tend to target men, killing men in great numbers,

530
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,240
 whether it's triggering wars that tend to target men in great numbers, start thinning

531
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,720
 the herd like that, and then you unleash something like this, right?

532
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,320
 A virus that men catch that causes women to kill them.

533
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,760
 You can't stop it, you're emitting this weird odor for some reason.

534
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,400
 You're driving your car, you're headed back home, it's summer vacation, you're gonna go

535
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,640
 stay at your mom and pops house.

536
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,800
 You grew up and you pull up into the driveway, you walk into the house, you slip, you don't

537
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 remember your house being so slippery, do you?

538
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,840
 You slip, you realize you're laying in a pool of your father's blood, butchered, he's butchered

539
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,240
 and he's laying right by the front door of the house, and as your brain is trying to make

540
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,620
 sense of this, your mother, the woman who gave birth to you, begins smashing your head

541
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,280
 open with a ball peeing hammer.

542
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,360
 Maybe they perfect it so you don't even know you're giving off a smell, the smell is so

543
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,960
 subtle that only a woman can pick up on it.

544
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,600
 You're flying in a passenger jet, you got your headphones on, you're listening to some

545
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,040
 music fiddling around with your phone in airplane mode, which you really can't do much.

546
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 Watching some movie that you downloaded and you hear a scuffle, you look up, you see one

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,320
 of the stewardesses punching someone in first class just right in the face over and over

548
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,760
 again, you figure, ah it's probably some guy, it's probably some guy who's mouthing

549
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,840
 off maybe not wearing his mask, who knows?

550
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,160
 The stewardess had enough of it, maybe I should whip out my phone and start taking a video

551
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,600
 of it, and by the time you pull your phone out to start recording it, you start to notice

552
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,280
 the fight has spread, you start seeing women just standing up and gouging out the eyes

553
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,640
 of the men next to him, or wrapping a seatbelt around someone's throat and pulling hard until

554
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,520
 the man's face turns purple.

555
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,600
 And right when your phone starts to be able to focus in on everything, you feel your own

556
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,240
 hair being pulled.

557
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,920
 The woman who was seated behind you just has a handful and she's yanking it backwards.

558
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:55,000
 As two more women leap on you and rain down a flurry of fists quickly pummeling you into

559
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,480
 unconsciousness.

560
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:07,360
 Maybe even they figured out a way to make myrchitis not only non detectable, but something that

561
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,560
 men just naturally give off.

562
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,880
 Maybe they've spent time getting this into our food supply, into our dietary supplements,

563
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
 into our bodies.

564
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,440
 So it's not just that one generation of men would have myrchitis, but it would be something

565
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,200
 that would be spread throughout humanity.

566
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,840
 So that all boys from baby to elderly man would give off this scent.

567
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:48,080
 When the time was right, it would be triggered and all males would give off this kill switch.

568
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,600
 To the point that you're a doctor at a hospital and you're standing there in front of one

569
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,160
 of your pregnant patients, you're there to give her the good news.

570
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,200
 She's going to have a little baby boy.

571
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,320
 And almost on cue, you couldn't have played out any better.

572
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:17,240
 When you say that, this switch is activated and she reaches for the sharpest object she

573
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:25,480
 can find in the office and begins stabbing herself in the stomach, trying to destroy

574
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,400
 the little boy inside of her.

575
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
 You're freaked out.

576
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
 You don't know what to do.

577
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
 You leave the office.

578
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,600
 You begin running through the hospital.

579
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:44,280
 And that's when you see a group of nurses opening up the neonatal unit and lunging towards the

580
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:53,160
 little boy babies swaddled in blue blankets.

581
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,760
 You think it's far-fetched?

582
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,680
 And it may be.

583
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:06,200
 But the battle of the sexes will not always remain a metaphorical statement.

584
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,000
 Someday someone will pull that trigger.

585
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,960
 Someday someone will believe that they know what's better for the future of mankind and

586
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,080
 that is either a world without men or a world without women.

587
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,720
 Once they figure out a way to safely keep the human race going, there will be a war

588
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:36,880
 that is so brutal and so inhuman, we won't even be able to imagine the scale of it.

589
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,200
 You've already fought wars over the dumbest of reasons.

590
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
 This would be a war for the future of humanity.

591
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,920
 A planet of all men or a planet of all women, now and forever.

592
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:01,760
 Once you figure out a way to biologically not need the other side, the clock will start

593
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
 ticking.

594
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:33,080
 And when it hits midnight, the world as we know it will be washed away in a sea of blood.

595
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:51,480
 And when it hits midnight, the world as we know it will be washed away in a sea of blood.

596
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,060
 (upbeat music)
