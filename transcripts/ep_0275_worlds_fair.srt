1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 There is a far-off enchanted land ruled by pink dolphins.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,880
 And sometimes they just want to dance.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,200
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that world fares all over the world

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,480
 have one purpose, not to bring the world together, not to show off the advancements in technology,

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,400
 but to destroy the remnants of ancient civilizations that were here before us today on Dead Rabbit

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
 Radio.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,080
 So let's go ahead and jump into the episode here.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,520
 Now our first story is a request and it's funny because this is a request for actually

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,520
 both segments today are requests and they're both requests from like last year.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,160
 Hopefully they still listen to the podcast.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
 Doesn't matter.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,000
 But anyways, whether or not they listen to the podcast, but sometimes it takes me a long

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
 time to get through your request.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,200
 So if you've ever sent me a request for a story and I haven't done it yet, it's not

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,600
 because I think it's lame.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,680
 I just really haven't had time to research yet, but I got these two guys going today.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
 This is a request from Ian.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 I believe it was YouTube.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,920
 Ian, I'm not going to give out the last name because I don't know if it's your real last

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,160
 name, but Ian, you know who you are?

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,120
 Maybe not because we haven't started the segment yet, but thanks Ian for this request.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
 Everyone, hop on board the rabbit robot.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,040
 This is going to be a water journey for us.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
 So get on the rabbit robot, each of us grab an ore and start paddling, paddling.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,240
 And then after a couple of strokes, I just lean back and I'm like, hey, you do it.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,880
 I'm going to do the talking.

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
 You do the rowing.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,120
 And we are going to a magical enchanted land known as the Enconte.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:02:01,600
 As you're going down this river, magical birds flying around, doing magical bird stuff.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,160
 Beautiful palm trees are overhanging the river on both sides of the bank.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,400
 That's the theme song for this realm.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
 Every time you're in there, you hear this song play.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,080
 No matter where you're at, you can never sleep in this realm.

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,240
 Okay, this is going on long enough.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,600
 Okay, so anyways, I'm leaning back in the rowboat.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 You're struggling.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,760
 We're going up river.

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
 We're going upstream.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
 You're like, ah, can't we go the other way?

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,480
 I'm like, no, the story is this way.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,560
 And as we're going, I'm just joking, the story is that way too, but I just want to see, you

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,320
 got to get a workout, get an upper body workout.

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
 So we're coming up the river.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,640
 We start to see pink dolphins splash next to us.

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,960
 Try not to hit them with the paddles because they're jumping up and you're like, oh, this

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 is so beautiful.

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,840
 That music's a little annoying, but this is so beautiful and serene.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,440
 And then one of them looks at you and goes, it is, isn't it?

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,320
 And then they jump back into the water and you're like talking pink dolphins.

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
 I'm like, yeah.

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
 And I'm like, yes.

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,080
 Yes, young fellow travelers.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,560
 I like my corn cob pipe.

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,680
 It is quite the amazing place here in the incontae.

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:12,800
 The incontae is a place that is populated by these pink dolphins, known as the incontados.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,480
 But it's a peaceful place where there is no suffering, no pain, only happiness, wealth.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
 There's food everywhere.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,760
 The music's a little annoying, but you got birds chirping.

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 You got pink dolphins.

64
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
 You got an endless river.

65
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,440
 You don't like that part either because you're going to have to row down it.

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,480
 But it's everything you would expect a utopian dimension to be.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,600
 Now we love our time here because this is not what we're used to.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,880
 Where the incontados get bored after a while.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,400
 I've always wondered, I imagine heaven would be boring after a while.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,800
 After the first 20,000 years, you'd be like, sit on a different cloud.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,320
 Now I think the idea of a peaceful dimension would get boring after a while.

72
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,000
 At a certain point, I'd be like, hey, God, can I go fight an alien war or something?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,080
 Can you reincarnate me into a goliath monster on some other planet?

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 I'll kill adventurers.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
 He's like, yeah, sure.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
 Whatever.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 God can do anything.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
 He just sends me there.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,680
 I eat a bunch of people and come back to heaven.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
 But I imagine it gets super boring.

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,520
 So these guys get bored of their utopian society.

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,160
 So what they do is every so often, they will swim through their magical rivers and then

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:34,160
 splash out into our realm, Earth, specifically the Amazon River, cutting through the Amazon

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 in Brazil.

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 So let's follow them.

86
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
 And you're like, no, no, it's so peaceful here.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 I don't want to go back.

88
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
 It's horrible on Earth.

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
 I'm like, come on, just let's go.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,080
 So against your wishes, the boat goes through the portal and now we're in the Amazon rainforest

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,960
 and we automatically just feel human misery just lay on top of us.

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,040
 I'm like, yeah, we probably should have stayed there.

93
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,640
 But anyways, now here's the story of these guys.

94
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,240
 In Brazil culture, they have these stories of the incantados.

95
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,200
 And what happens is these pink dolphins are in there are really pink dolphins in the

96
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,020
 Amazon River.

97
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,520
 But the question is this, can these pink dolphins turn into humans?

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
 Because that's the legend.

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,720
 What happens is these pink dolphins come from their dimension into ours and they not only

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,340
 want to experience like pain and suffering, they also want to experience pleasure.

101
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,680
 They need to have both.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
 So they've developed the ability to shape shift into human males.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,920
 And what they do is they come out of the river and they're a dude.

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
 They're like, oh, this is pretty awesome.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
 Look at these feet.

106
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
 Isn't it great?

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
 Or however that song goes and they start walking.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
 I don't think that's the song.

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,640
 And they will walk and they are attracted to the sound of music.

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,080
 So I imagine it's like Terminator.

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,760
 They're just like a naked guy walking through the jungle and they're like, hey, I need your

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 clothes.

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,960
 They can use mind control, actually.

114
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
 That's one of their spells.

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
 So if they ran into you, they're just like, give me your clothes, your boots and your

116
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
 motorcycle.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
 And the guys like, well, I don't have a motorcycle.

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
 It's the Amazon jungle, but here's my clothes and my boots.

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
 And you just walk around.

120
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,600
 Now they'll go to these parties and they'll just start boogying down.

121
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,760
 They're actually known to be amazing musicians.

122
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
 The most gifted musicians in the world.

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,120
 So they sit there and pull out their guitar.

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
 Give me your guitar.

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
 The guy's like, okay, give them the guitar.

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
 No, no, no, no, no.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
 Playing the guitar.

128
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 And people fall in love with them.

129
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,120
 Now they also not only love to party, not only love to create music, but they love to

130
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
 bang women.

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,220
 It's one of the things they're known for and they're deadbeat dads.

132
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,600
 So basically they just go to a party, grab some dude's guitar, starts playing it.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
 A bunch of girls come over.

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,840
 They bang them all and then they bounce.

135
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,920
 They just run back to the river because eventually people may figure them out.

136
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,440
 They have one telling flaw to them.

137
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,080
 And if they're ever found out, they will actually just run back to the river and then turn into

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 a penguin.

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,000
 Not a penguin, they'll turn into a dolphin again.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,520
 They'd be surprised if they like magically turn into a penguin.

141
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,240
 They're like, uh-oh, this is not what I'm supposed to be.

142
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
 And they swim away and then they go back to their home dimension.

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,800
 And they're like, dude, it was totally awesome.

144
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,920
 Play the guitar, banged a bunch of chicks.

145
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,160
 Now they have these magical abilities.

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,560
 They can control the weather, which is an amazing ability.

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,200
 Make it storm and be like, oh, sorry, honey, your clothes are all wet.

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
 Better take them off.

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
 Okay, that's really, really handy.

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,560
 They can transform you into an intocato.

151
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,360
 So you have a fetish of turning into a pink dolphin, head to Brazil.

152
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,760
 You might run into one of these guys, but they can also curse you.

153
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
 They can drive you insane.

154
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,680
 They can use magic to kill you.

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,960
 And all of those are useful skills or useful spells if you're like traveling to our world

156
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,080
 and don't want to get caught.

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,720
 Just cause a huge rainstorm, mudslide, all your pursuers get caught in the mud.

158
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,000
 But out of all of that, there's one thing they can't do.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 This is so bizarre.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
 There's one thing they can't do.

161
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,480
 They can't magically make their blowhole disappear.

162
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,680
 So the way you can tell that you're talking to someone at a bar, this cute guy, and you're

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
 chatting him up and you're like, that's kind of weird.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,040
 He's wearing his hat all the time.

165
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
 That's what they always do.

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,360
 They wear hats because they can't cover up their blowhole.

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
 So my conspiracy theory, Fred Durst, is an intocato.

168
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,640
 Full ability, hat all the time.

169
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 I don't know.

170
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,600
 But anyways, where was I going with that?

171
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 Oh yeah, yeah.

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
 So they have the blowhole.

173
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,520
 So sometimes their hat gets knocked off and that's why I was saying they'll run away and

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,480
 then jump in the river and people chase them down.

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,720
 I think this is, this legend has been created for two reasons.

176
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,480
 One, they're also known to, and I should have said this earlier, but they're known to kidnap

177
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 people.

178
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,800
 And so people in Brazil, people by the Amazon River don't like to be in the river by themselves.

179
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,680
 They don't like to be by the river after dusk.

180
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,560
 And whenever it's dark, don't be by the river.

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
 Don't be by yourself.

182
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,000
 Don't swim in the river if you can avoid it.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,520
 I mean, it's a really hot day, but you really shouldn't swim in the river because you might

184
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
 get kidnapped by a dolphin.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
 And those are all, we've looked at this before.

186
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,560
 These myths tend to have reasons behind them.

187
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,840
 This one is basically don't play in the Amazon River.

188
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,600
 A pink dolphin may not get you, but a bow constrictor can or the riptide or anything

189
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 like that.

190
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
 So there's definitely a reason behind this.

191
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,600
 And I think it's interesting, is one of their main things is leaving illegitimate children

192
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 behind.

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,320
 And I think that's a way to explain young women getting pregnant.

194
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,680
 It's basically like if a young woman gets pregnant, instead of being shamed by being

195
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,960
 like tricked by a man, by a mortal man who likes to do stuff, they can just say, "Oh,

196
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,880
 he must use some sort of magic spell to get you."

197
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,280
 And it's a way to explain that away as well.

198
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,680
 So being a, having an illegitimate child loses a bit of its social stigma if you're up against

199
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
 a mythological being.

200
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,280
 No one's going to blame the girl for dressing up like a cow and getting banged by Zeus.

201
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,600
 Well, I guess dressing up as a cow is kind of weird, but when you're being seduced by

202
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,720
 a mythological creature, it's really hard to say, "You did something wrong."

203
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,880
 So I think that's one of the other reasons behind this.

204
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,360
 But the pink dolphins, like I said, are real.

205
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,120
 And the people in the area still see them as mythological creatures.

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,080
 The problem is that commercial fishermen kill them.

207
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,880
 Now they don't sell the dolphin meat, but apparently pink dolphin meat is super tasty

208
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 for catfish.

209
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,760
 And the fishermen are trying to get catfish so they'll kill these dolphins.

210
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,560
 And then they will make bait out of these pink dolphins to get all these catfish.

211
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,960
 To the point where the Brazilian government had to put up a temporary ban from catfishing,

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,040
 from fishing for catfish, to prevent people from killing all these dolphins.

213
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,600
 And they said, "We're going to keep the ban going on long enough to give the pink dolphin

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,360
 population time to repopulate," and so on and so forth.

215
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,520
 It's an interesting myth because it still is, I don't want to say relevant today, but

216
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
 people still believe it.

217
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,680
 And I think it's become one of those things that is such a cultural thing.

218
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,200
 A rational person wouldn't go, "Yeah, yeah, don't go by the river at night, a dolphin

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
 may kidnap you."

220
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,800
 But people would still tell that story to kids to have them not go down to the river.

221
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,320
 And people have gotten such a connection to these pink dolphins that they don't want

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 them killed either.

223
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
 It's actually a very helpful myth.

224
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
 It helps the real pink dolphins from being slaughtered and it protects people from falling

225
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 in the river.

226
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
 It would be cool though.

227
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,640
 I personally wouldn't have a problem getting kidnapped by a pink dolphin and dragged into

228
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,720
 a realm full of peace and awesomeness if, again, going back to my heaven analogy, if

229
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,540
 I could then come out of that dimension at will to have some fun on earth.

230
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,360
 So if you know when Limp Biscuits on tour, hit me up.

231
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 You want to become a dolphin.

232
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
 Does anyone know who that band?

233
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,160
 That band was so huge when I was in college.

234
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
 So huge.

235
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 I've noticed something interesting as I've gotten older is that you can have a hit show

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,240
 and the second the last episode ends, people stop caring about it.

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
 I find that so bizarre.

238
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,920
 You can have a show that's on for seven seasons, ten seasons, whatever, and it ends.

239
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,680
 And then the next week happens and people forget about it.

240
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,800
 They just go on with their lives.

241
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,400
 They'll still have maybe a fan base that will watch it, but for the most part it just leaves

242
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,920
 the cultural zeitgeist.

243
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,120
 Like who sits around and talks about Lost anymore other than a few diehard fans?

244
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
 Same thing with bands.

245
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,120
 Movies don't have that thing because we expect movies to just come out and then kind of disappear.

246
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,480
 But televisions and music we develop an emotional connection to.

247
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,720
 I'm not talking about bands like The Beatles, but a band like Limp Biscuit who was super

248
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,120
 huge for a long time and then just kind of stopped making music.

249
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
 I don't know if they're still around.

250
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,400
 I think they broke up or something like that.

251
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,280
 They might still be touring, but they just drop off and then people go, "Oh, what's the

252
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 new band?

253
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
 It's a television show."

254
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
 I find that fascinating.

255
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,920
 I find that absolutely fascinating.

256
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 Cultural memory.

257
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 You know what?

258
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,760
 That's actually a good segue.

259
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
 Because we're going to go on.

260
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
 We're going to leave behind Brazil.

261
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
 Let's hop on board the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

262
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
 We're going old school with this one.

263
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 And it's cold powered.

264
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,520
 So start shoveling while you're shoveling coal into the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

265
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,280
 I'm going to sit back, drink some lemonade, and tell you this story.

266
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,640
 This story was recommended last year as well by a user named SpunkyDunk.

267
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
 SpunkyDunk.

268
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,080
 I don't think that's your first name or your last name, so I have no problem saying the

269
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
 whole thing.

270
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,760
 Thank you for the recommendation, SpunkyDunk.

271
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,280
 We are going to Chicago.

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,160
 Chicago, Illinois.

273
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
 Let's fly there.

274
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,200
 We go all the way over there, right?

275
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,560
 And we're also going to go back in time.

276
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,720
 We're going back to the year of 1893.

277
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,840
 Now two things happened historically in 1893 in Chicago.

278
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,080
 One, there was the serial killer known as H.H. Holmes.

279
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
 I'm not going to go in total detail.

280
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,880
 I actually planned on doing a little segment on him.

281
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 I'll keep it brief.

282
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,040
 He was basically an American serial killer who built a hotel that had all these traps

283
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,400
 in it so people would go into their hotel rooms and the door wouldn't open.

284
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,120
 Which is kind of like just going to a motel six, any motel six.

285
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,800
 But the door wouldn't open and then he would suffocate you or you would starve to death

286
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,040
 and the hotel rooms had trapped doors.

287
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
 You're like, this is fascinating.

288
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
 Tell me more.

289
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,440
 But there's a trap door out of each room and he would throw bodies in it and they would

290
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,640
 slide down this slide like an episode of Scooby-Doo into a barrel of acid.

291
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,440
 So that's not like Scooby-Doo.

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
 And he murdered much people.

293
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,560
 He was an abortion doctor who would say, oh yeah, I can do that abortion.

294
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,520
 Then he would just murder the woman.

295
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,720
 And he eventually got arrested for burning the building down for insurance purposes.

296
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,880
 But the reason why, it's funny because he's one of the most famous American serial killers.

297
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,080
 That's one reason I don't want to do the segment because he's very, very popular and I try to

298
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,640
 cover more obscure stuff.

299
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,200
 But also the reason why I have read a lot about H.H. Holmes.

300
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,680
 I've read a couple of true crime books on it.

301
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,800
 I actually have done a lot of research on H.H. Holmes over the years, not just for this

302
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 episode.

303
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,640
 And also over the years it's come out that a lot of stories about him are fictitious.

304
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,920
 There were a lot of fiction novels written about him around the time.

305
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,080
 And because they were in that time period, they filtered into the actual quote unquote

306
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,120
 knowledge we have about H.H. Holmes.

307
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,360
 So I didn't want to do a whole segment on him and then have to say, well we don't know

308
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,760
 if this happened, we don't know if that happened.

309
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,520
 They really don't know how many people he killed in the hotel.

310
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,440
 He killed a couple people while he was on the run from the law for burning down the

311
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
 building and stuff like that.

312
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,160
 But the idea of him having this huge saw like house with all these trapped doors in the

313
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,680
 asset map, people to this day are like, maybe he had that stuff.

314
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,040
 He might have, but I mean it's basically a story that it kind of dead ends itself.

315
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
 Because he didn't get convicted for any of that stuff.

316
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,440
 He's been suspected of killing up to 200 people, but nobody knows.

317
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,760
 He had a crematorium built in his basement.

318
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,000
 He's like, yeah, it was there when I moved in.

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,240
 So again, nobody really knows.

320
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,200
 I might do a segment on his ghost though.

321
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,320
 But anyways, let's get into the meat of the matter here.

322
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,160
 The other thing Chicago was known for in 1893 and what brought H.H. Holmes there, let me

323
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
 talk about him for a second more.

324
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,400
 He built a hotel because the World's Fair was happening that year in Chicago and he

325
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,160
 wanted to have a hotel.

326
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,120
 To bring all these people in to make a bunch of money and possibly murder them.

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,520
 And maybe his ghost shows up in another episode.

328
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,720
 But 1893 is the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus setting sail and it's not, it was

329
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 actually 1492.

330
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,160
 It just took him a long time to get this World's Fair off the ground.

331
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,280
 When you do a World's Fair, what you have to do is you have to build a bunch of new buildings.

332
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
 It's a very weird thing.

333
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,520
 It basically shows amazing architecture, technological advancements, cultural things

334
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 going on.

335
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,280
 When you go to the World's Expo or World's Fair, it's different terms for different countries.

336
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,920
 When you go to the committee that organized these things, you have to show all the, you

337
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,200
 have to show like diagrams of all the buildings you're going to build and they go, "Oh, those

338
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 are wonderful.

339
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,080
 Yeah, we'll award you this year's World's Fair.

340
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 It's every five years.

341
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
 But anyways, we'll reward you the upcoming World's Fair.

342
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,000
 You have to have like this amazing layout."

343
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,880
 And so in 1893, Chicago won it, won the right to do it.

344
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
 This is mind boggling.

345
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,360
 It was so huge.

346
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
 25% of the US population showed up.

347
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
 I can't imagine anything.

348
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,440
 People, 25% of the US population doesn't even watch Avengers Endgame.

349
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
 I mean, you know what I mean?

350
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,320
 Like, they don't even go to a movie theater.

351
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,760
 Not saying that they should, but they can't even go to a movie theater or watch the same

352
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
 movie.

353
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,720
 25% of the United States population at that time had visited this World's Fair and had

354
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,240
 all of these beautiful buildings put up.

355
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,840
 And they were done in this neoclassical style.

356
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,440
 Have these Renaissance influences and Gothic influences and French influences.

357
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,840
 So you had the city of Chicago, which is grimy, hellhole, especially back then there was a

358
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,000
 serial killer maybe running around.

359
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 But in the midst of it, you had these beautiful, brand new buildings in this giant area, the

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
 World Expo area, the World's Fair area.

361
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,600
 Now they were made out of, this is where we start to get into the conspiracy theory though.

362
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,640
 They were made out of plaster and wood, because you had to build them very quickly.

363
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,560
 And the goal was to eventually tear them down.

364
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,800
 You weren't going to keep them there.

365
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
 But at a certain point someone says, "I think this building is beautiful.

366
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 They're looking to design.

367
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,960
 They're like, let's make it a little more sturdy and then after the World's Fair, we'll

368
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,720
 knock down all the plaster stuff and then we'll rebuild a more beautiful building on

369
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
 top of it."

370
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,280
 So they were starting to use stone and bricks for some of the buildings.

371
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,640
 But most of them were just wood and plaster.

372
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
 It was like a movie set.

373
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,040
 You'd walk and you'd be like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."

374
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 Walk around.

375
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,520
 Tesla did all the lighting.

376
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,680
 That poor guy.

377
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,840
 That poor dude, man.

378
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,800
 He literally died in poverty, but he's just a footnote in so many stories.

379
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,680
 And he invented supposedly a death ray.

380
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,240
 Maybe H.H. Holmes used it.

381
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,160
 Maybe that was one of his stories.

382
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,120
 Actually dude, that would be a great idea for like a novel.

383
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,200
 Tesla versus Holmes.

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 Not Sherlock.

385
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,840
 And you have like this scientist trying to stop a serial killer.

386
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,760
 That would be, that, oh damn it.

387
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,960
 That actually was a movie.

388
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,920
 It was called, it was really good movie.

389
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
 I think it was called Time After Time.

390
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,320
 And it was a movie about, this is going to sound crazy and dope at the same time.

391
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
 It was this movie I saw as a kid.

392
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,480
 And it was H.G. Wells versus Jack the Ripper.

393
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,800
 And Jack the Ripper steals H.G. Wells' time machine and comes to the 80s.

394
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,360
 And so H.G. Wells has to get in the time machine or he builds a new one or whatever and goes

395
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 into the 80s.

396
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,640
 So it's the story of this author chasing this serial killer around in the 1980s L.A.

397
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
 It was really good.

398
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
 I totally forgot about that movie.

399
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 That movie's dope.

400
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 It was so funny.

401
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,080
 I got a, when I asked for suggestions a couple episodes ago, Jimmy emailed me and says,

402
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,320
 "Hey, you should do Dead Rabbit Recommends again."

403
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,400
 Dead Rabbit Recommends, I got to look up the title of that movie.

404
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
 Hold on.

405
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
 It was called Time After Time.

406
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,720
 It actually came out in 1979 and this is bizarre.

407
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,040
 You know that Cindy Lauper song, Time After Time?

408
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,440
 She came up with the title for that song because she was flipping through the TV guide one

409
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,160
 day and saw that movie was playing on TV.

410
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,880
 That weird.

411
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,120
 And she thought about it.

412
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
 She goes, "I don't want to rip that off."

413
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120
 And she took the title out of the song and it didn't work.

414
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 So she put the title back.

415
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
 That's weird.

416
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
 But anyways, Dead Rabbit Recommends Time After Time.

417
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,680
 It's actually a movie that's not a big deal.

418
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

419
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

420
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

421
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

423
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

424
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

425
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

426
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

427
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

428
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

429
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

430
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

431
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

432
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

433
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

434
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

435
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

436
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

437
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

438
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

439
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

440
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

441
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

442
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

443
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

444
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

445
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

446
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

447
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

448
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

449
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

450
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

451
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

452
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

453
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

454
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

455
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

456
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

457
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

458
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

459
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

460
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

461
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

462
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

463
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

464
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

465
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

466
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

467
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

468
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

469
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

470
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

471
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

472
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
 It's a movie that's not a big deal.

473
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 They really couldn't fight off Europeans with flintlock pistols

474
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,680
 because they were destroyed by the settlers.

475
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,680
 And as the cities in America begin to rise up,

476
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,680
 the powers that be had to look out their window

477
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,680
 and see these ancient buildings sitting in the middle of their city.

478
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,680
 And it reminded them that they were not the rulers of the planet.

479
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 No, no, no.

480
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,680
 It told them that there was someone greater there before they were.

481
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 So they all got together in their meeting house,

482
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,680
 the powers that be incorporated on Illuminati Street.

483
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 They all get there and they go,

484
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
 "What are we going to do about these ancient buildings?"

485
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 Eventually people are going to start asking questions.

486
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
 The leader does something,

487
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,680
 sinister strokes a cat, smokes a cigar, whatever,

488
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
 and says, "There's only one thing we can do.

489
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 There's only one possible scenario.

490
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,680
 Every five years we're going to hold a world's fair in a different city."

491
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 Now the cat's smoking the cigar.

492
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,680
 So what we will do is we will have a world's fair in these cities.

493
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,680
 And we will tell people we built these buildings out of plaster.

494
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 And because they're built out of plaster, we have to tear them down.

495
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,680
 But we're really tearing down the ancient ruins of a civilization

496
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 far greater than our own.

497
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,680
 Everyone's like, "That is a great idea, sir.

498
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 That is a great, great idea the cats clap into."

499
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
 Little pause.

500
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
 So that's what they did.

501
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
 The world's fair was held all over the world.

502
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,680
 Wherever a city needed to have some ancient ruins destroyed,

503
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
 they got the world's fair contract.

504
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 Because we can look at world's fair in San Francisco, New York, and things like that,

505
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 and they have these great buildings and then they're gone.

506
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,680
 The only way to explain that is there was a civilization before us

507
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
 and those buildings weren't actually plastered,

508
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,680
 because if they were plastered, there should have been photos of them being built.

509
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,680
 Now, what I just told you, it's found and scattered across the internet.

510
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,680
 It's actually part of a bigger conspiracy theory called "Lost Time" or "Stolen Time,"

511
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 which we'll get into that in another episode.

512
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,680
 It's too complex to kind of scram into here.

513
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,680
 The idea is, like the Mudflat episode, "The Tatarian Empire."

514
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,680
 I don't have a problem with the idea that there were civilizations long before ours,

515
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 but I think they would be hundreds of thousands of years behind us.

516
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 Maybe a million years.

517
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,680
 I can understand on that time scale that buildings would be destroyed in the mall,

518
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
 if she'd have no idea anyone was there before.

519
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,680
 I'll buy into that. I'll at least entertain that thought.

520
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,680
 If this was true in any way, shape, or form, and it absolutely is not true in any way, shape, or form,

521
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
 here's the thing.

522
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
 It's 1893, it's Chicago.

523
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,680
 People have been roaming around that area now for close to a-- over a century?

524
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,680
 It wasn't like the city was founded in 1892. There was a city there.

525
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,680
 So the people who lived there every day would walk by and go, "Hey, isn't that weird, buddy?

526
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 Lookit, it's the Colosseum sitting in the middle of old Shide Town."

527
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
 Everyone's like, "Yeah."

528
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,680
 And then they're like, "Let's go to this hotel and get murdered."

529
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,680
 The idea that everyone in that town would have totally forgotten those buildings were there,

530
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,680
 and then someone comes in and goes, "Those buildings are fake,

531
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
 and we're going to knock them down in a couple months."

532
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
 Everyone's like, "What? Yeah, I guess you're right."

533
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,680
 Like, the buildings were there for thousands and thousands of years, according to them.

534
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,680
 So the people-- they do not have an argument for this,

535
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
 because I was looking through this big Reddit thread about it.

536
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,680
 But the thing is that one person brought it up.

537
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
 One person brought this argument up.

538
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,680
 If these buildings existed for thousands or hundreds of years, whatever timeline you want,

539
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,680
 and then we destroyed them, told everyone they were made out of plaster and we destroyed them,

540
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,680
 wouldn't the people in Chicago have been able to see that those buildings were there when they moved in?

541
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,680
 They long predated the World Fair.

542
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
 And the answer was this.

543
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
 Hypothetically, he says. All hypothetically.

544
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
 This is what this guy-- this is his argument.

545
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
 "In between shifts at the factory?"

546
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
 Question mark.

547
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
 Like, these Lunkheads, they just work at a factory.

548
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
 Like, they just walk from factory to home.

549
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 They're just automatons.

550
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
 They're nothing like us smart thinkers.

551
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
 But he goes, "In between shifts--"

552
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,680
 Yes, you would notice if the call of Sam was in between your job at the factory and home.

553
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
 You would notice that.

554
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,680
 And if someone said, "Oh, no, we built that yesterday."

555
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
 No matter how much of a Lunkhead you are,

556
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
 you understand how time works.

557
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,680
 You understand how things progress through the universe.

558
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,680
 But anyways, "In between shifts at the factory?"

559
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,680
 Similarly, I doubt people in ISIS territory know ISIS is the facing and destroying local sites.

560
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
 That's a common thing that comes up.

561
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,680
 You know, ISIS and Al Qaeda was doing it too, where they'd blow up statues of like old Buddhist statues in their territory.

562
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,680
 They wanted to destroy all of these landmarks that refer to any other religion.

563
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
 Here's the thing.

564
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 One, Chicago is not ISIS-controlled territory, for one.

565
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,680
 The violence rate is quite high, but it's not ISIS-high.

566
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 Two, ISIS-controlled huge swaths of desert.

567
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,680
 So again, it's not like people were leaving their factory going to home and there happened to be a giant Buddhist statue.

568
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
 It's in the middle of nowhere.

569
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,680
 Three, even if you did know that ISIS was blowing up statues around you, you don't care.

570
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
 You're an ISIS-controlled country.

571
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,680
 You don't care what they do as long as you're alive.

572
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
 But anyway, so that's a common argument.

573
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,680
 ISIS goes around destroying monuments all the time.

574
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,680
 We probably did it too, for the same reason, to cover up the past.

575
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
 The quote goes on here.

576
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
 "I agree this is entailing.

577
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,680
 I agree this is a massive plot hole."

578
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,680
 They know this is, they have a weakness to this argument.

579
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,680
 I agree this is a massive plot hole, but if you look into the Hearst newspaper dynasty,

580
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,680
 Hearst misspelled, by the way, Hearst newspaper dynasty and others like it,

581
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,680
 you may, you may come to see it as feasible, so a lot of wiggle words here,

582
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,680
 you may come to see it as feasible that people did notice and care that the buildings were destroyed.

583
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,680
 But the media avoided covering the backlash and with no user-controlled social media,

584
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
 how else does the news get out?

585
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
 Well, I mean, people had their own newspapers and stuff like that,

586
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
 but anyways, apparently without Twitter, the universe is doomed.

587
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,680
 And after the person saying, "Hey," asked the question I asked,

588
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,680
 "When did people notice the buildings were there?"

589
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,680
 After that lunacy, the response is, "Fair enough, I could buy that."

590
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,680
 That's the mental level we're dealing with, with this conspiracy theory.

591
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 Nothing that guy said really made sense.

592
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 And he gives enough wiggle room that you're like, "Maybe it's feasible."

593
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,680
 The point is, he never answered this specific question.

594
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 Why didn't people notice the buildings were there before?

595
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 He goes, "People may have been upset that the buildings were being destroyed."

596
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
 But he also acknowledges this is a massive plot hole.

597
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
 Those buildings were fake.

598
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
 They were built out of plaster.

599
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,680
 And what eventually another redditor got on.

600
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,680
 Here's photos of San Francisco before their World Fair.

601
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 Here's photos afterwards, because they were saying this was happening everywhere.

602
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,680
 I'm focusing mainly on Chicago, but the buildings weren't there in these previous photos,

603
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
 and people just kind of stopped responding to that.

604
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,680
 So there are people pushing back against this, but it's basically out there.

605
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,680
 It's one of those conspiracy theories that is out there and it is growing.

606
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,680
 I got this from a Reddit thread that has 10,200, what is it?

607
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
 Subscribers, followers, whatever they are on Reddit.

608
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,680
 It's just such a bizarre conspiracy theory.

609
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,680
 And it's one that is based 100% on lack of photographic evidence.

610
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,680
 Bigfoot is based on, here's a photo, a Bigfoot.

611
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 Ghosts are based on experiences, and Bigfoot too,

612
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
 but you know what I mean?

613
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,680
 There are conspiracy theories that are based on people seeing things,

614
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,680
 experiencing things, or being presented with "evidence" of those things.

615
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
 This is the opposite.

616
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,680
 This is, "I have no evidence that my theory is not true, therefore it is true."

617
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,680
 And there's really no way to argue that, other than saying,

618
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
 "Well, when did they recognize those buildings before?"

619
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
 And that didn't phase this guy.

620
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,680
 He just went on, started talking on sense until the other person either gave up,

621
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
 or was actually convinced.

622
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,680
 I don't have a problem with the idea of ancient civilizations long before us.

623
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:02,680
 I 100% do not believe they existed, and were building monuments in America before we got here.

624
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 Like, I'm talking recent history.

625
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,680
 We do have evidence of the Tatarian Empire, which was a real place

626
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,680
 that Russia basically wiped off the map and wiped out of the history books.

627
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,680
 But it wasn't this super civilization that was this...

628
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 It wasn't in Conte on Earth.

629
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
 It wasn't this peaceful...

630
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,680
 A lot of people build up the Tatarian Empire to be this offshoot of the Roman Empire.

631
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
 It was a Muslim-controlled country.

632
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,680
 And so you have this element of people finding these bits of history

633
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,680
 that have been suppressed, 'cause that does happen,

634
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,680
 and then turning it into the new Atlantean of this multicultural, peace-loving,

635
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,680
 but super weapon-having civilization that was destroyed by the powers that be.

636
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,680
 When it actually was a section of Russia that was predominantly Muslim,

637
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
 and that's why the Russians shut them down.

638
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
 That's why the Russians were like, "Get rid of them."

639
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,680
 They do it all the time. They were doing it with Chechnya back in the 90s.

640
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,680
 And I kind of think today, but back in the 90s, just get rid of them.

641
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,680
 So that's why they got pushed out. They're like, "I don't like you. Go away."

642
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,680
 If Europeans had come to America and they found these ancient structures,

643
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
 wouldn't they destroy them?

644
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:14,680
 That's the question, because you would have so much to learn from these things.

645
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,680
 And, more importantly, one of the key things to getting the settlers to move west

646
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:28,680
 was manifest destiny. It was God's purpose and will for the white men to push across the continent.

647
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,680
 Imagine if a bunch of white dudes sailed all the way to this new continent,

648
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,680
 got off the boat, and found architecture matching their own.

649
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:46,680
 That would be 100% proof that manifest destiny is true, that we had to conquer.

650
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:55,680
 It would be proof that the society of the Europeans is so amazing that it existed long before.

651
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
 That it was the only civilization that should exist on the planet.

652
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,680
 They wouldn't destroy it. They came over and found a bunch of Japanese temples.

653
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
 Yeah, they knock them down.

654
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,680
 But if they came over from France, from Britain, from Spain,

655
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
 and they found architecture that matched the Renaissance,

656
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,680
 they wouldn't then go, "Oh, these people don't exist."

657
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
 Your first conclusion would be like, "Oh, maybe people came over here before we did.

658
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,680
 Maybe we are not the first people over here."

659
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,680
 But you would go there and you'd be like, "Oh, this continent belongs to us.

660
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,680
 These people are from us and we're possibly from them.

661
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
 We own this place."

662
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,680
 It would have been 100% reason to cease control of the continent like that,

663
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,680
 which they did eventually, but it would have spurred them on more

664
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,680
 to know that they weren't alone, that their cultures were so amazing

665
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,680
 and so gifted that they discovered this continent and built these structures here,

666
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
 and then rediscovered it.

667
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,680
 You didn't go over there and find buildings from other cultures.

668
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
 You found buildings from your culture.

669
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,680
 It would be the equivalent of if we landed on the moon,

670
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
 there was already an American flag there.

671
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
 We wouldn't knock it down.

672
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
 We'd be like, "USA, USA."

673
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:11,680
 It would show that for some reason America actually existed long before America did.

674
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,680
 It would be the most telling thing in the world that that culture was determined to rule.

675
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,680
 If you went to Mars and you found the Statue of Liberty,

676
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,680
 you'd be like, "Oh, this is awesome. France may try to take credit for that,

677
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
 but you know what I mean? That would be the equivalent of that."

678
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,680
 This conspiracy theory is not thought through at all, really.

679
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,680
 But a lot of people believe it, and it's actually pretty easy to disprove

680
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,680
 other than everything I just said. This would be the kill shot.

681
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
 World fairs still happen today.

682
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,680
 You can go to a city where a world fair will be happening in five years,

683
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,680
 take a bunch of photos, and see if there are any ancient buildings that need to be knocked down.

684
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,680
 And if you happen to be walking through Rio de Janeiro or Kyoto, Japan,

685
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,680
 and you see a building amid the skyscrapers, the bustling people,

686
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
 as they're leaving their factory and just headed home,

687
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,680
 if you see a building down one of those side streets that has a neoclassical look

688
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,680
 that looks like something straight out of an architecture magazine from 1893,

689
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
 take a photo of that.

690
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,680
 You might have just found proof that the powers that be really are destroying the past.

691
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
 Or you've just gone insane.

692
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
