1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
 Did Jeffrey Epstein kill himself? Commit suicide? Or was he cloned? And then a young woman leaves

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,740
 her house one day and someone throws a bowl of blood all over her. And then things get

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,300
 weird. Today on Dead Rava Radio.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:33,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,340
 or I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,220
 had a great, great weekend.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,340
 Two quick things I wanted to talk about. One, I have a listener, a personal friend of mine

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,580
 I know her personally. Robin, it's Robin's birthday. Let's give her a hand even though

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,700
 she won't listen to this episode being recorded on her birthday. But she's a really cool kid.

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:01:00,100
 She's a professional fashion person. Like people pay her to dress them. Like she comes out

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,980
 and she talks to them for a while and goes, "Where are you at now? Where do you want to

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,140
 be in five years?" She picks out their clothes. She goes and she buys all their clothes. She's

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,660
 a really, really fascinating person to talk to. So happy birthday Robin. I've been on

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,260
 her for quite a few years. She's really cool. She listens to the show as well. And you'll

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:21,260
 notice the art is different for today's episode. That was provided by John from the Scar Group.

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,660
 Oh, mysterious. He seems to be a really cool guy. I don't know him as well as I know Robin,

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,980
 but I've talked to him a bit online. Great. That art works amazing. It was a hand sketched

18
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,020
 art. He was posting versions of it on Instagram as he was doing it. And it's just amazing.

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,020
 And it's funny because I sent it to Ash Black. Ash Black drew the normal logo we use on the

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,660
 show and I'm like, "Someone made fan art based on your art." The original logo, he just made

21
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,460
 when he was listening to Dead Rabbit Radio. I had an old version of the art. So it's

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,620
 just interesting to see how this community works. And Ash Black was like, "Dude, that's

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,260
 totally awesome." And I was like, "I know. It is awesome." So yeah. And it's funny because

24
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,700
 eventually I think someone will sketch something from John's art and come up with a new image

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,540
 on that. So I think I might flip the images back and forth every once in a while just

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,220
 to change things up. But Ash Black, that's still our official art for the show, but the

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,220
 John art is just this amazing gritty reboot, gritty retcon, however you want to put it.

28
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,860
 It's funny because I never noticed the teeth on the Dead Rabbit logo until John drew them.

29
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,540
 And I was like, "Oh yeah. I guess he does have teeth. I guess he does have things." So

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,340
 thanks to Ash Black, thanks to John from SCAR, the SCAR group. And thank you to Grant Scott

31
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,420
 as well. He does our, as above so below, image as well. Just an amazing artist that I've met.

32
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,700
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story. Now I want to say this. This is actually

33
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,020
 a second draft. I originally recorded a 15 minute segment on the ins and outs of the

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,780
 Jeffrey Epstein case and all of the ties to the different political factions and the rumors

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,700
 of this and that and everything. And I edited it and it was about 15 minutes long and when

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,640
 I got to the end of it, I go, "This is boring. This is really, really boring." It's nothing

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,500
 more than what you can read in the newspaper. I try to cover conspiracy theories that aren't

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,740
 mainstream and this one has gone mainstream, which is odd because I predicted a couple

39
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,220
 of videos ago that conspiracy theories are going to become incredibly mainstream. Both

40
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,460
 sides of the political aisles are thrown out accusations that the Clintons did it, that

41
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,380
 Trump did it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I recorded all that stuff and I was bored editing it

42
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,780
 and I figured you guys would be bored listening to it. And again, it's nothing more you can't

43
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,960
 learn by reading any series of websites. So I took it out. It was just, it's not one,

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,080
 it's not a story that I particularly have fun talking about because of the subject matter.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,360
 If you don't know, Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile who quote unquote killed himself. I personally

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
 think, because I maybe you guys want to know what my personal opinion is, I personally think

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
 that it's that he may have killed himself. Obviously, that's the obvious answer, but

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,120
 it's very, very, very, very, very suspicious. And I kind of just went on for about 15 minutes

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,700
 talking about different facts of the case and it was super, super boring. But all that

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,300
 being said, because I know people are going to say, Hey, how can we get in common on the

51
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,340
 case? That's, it's boring to me personally, but I, it's very, very suspicious that, that

52
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,940
 he died when he died. But what I find fascinating about it is you have the both sides of political

53
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,060
 aisle throwing out different conspiracy theories at each other, which may or may not be valid.

54
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,220
 We don't know is the has to go through this whole investigation thing, but like most, most

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,440
 criminal acts do, but like that, like that, remember when 9/11 happened? Of course you

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,040
 do 9/11 happens. And then people start saying there was control demolitions and that inside

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,000
 job and all this stuff. And then people said, no, no, no, you guys, you guys are wrong. You

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,360
 guys who believe the planes brought down the buildings, you guys are wrong. And you guys

59
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,040
 who believed it was an inside job are wrong. It was actually holographic planes or space

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,480
 lasers or time loops or whatever. There's always someone out there who wants to outweard

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:56,100
 both sides of the conspiracy and it's happened already, already. There are reports online,

62
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,100
 just flittering whispers actually, just see them pop up here and there. I wasn't able

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,380
 to actually find a particular website because I would just read them and then it would just

64
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,260
 disappear in the wind like dust, right? Because people realize how stupid it is. But trust

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,780
 me, this will gain traction. This will gain traction. Jeffrey Epstein was cloned. Do you

66
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,580
 see the body that was wheeled out on the gurney doesn't look like Jeffrey Epstein. Did you

67
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,480
 know that? Look at these two pictures. I'm going to show you a picture of Jeffrey Epstein's

68
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,720
 mugshot photo and then I'm going to show you a picture of a corpse. Now, I used to work

69
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
 in a crematory. I think I've told you guys about that before and that aside, I've seen

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,400
 a lot of dead people and you don't generally look the same when you die. One, your soul's

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,680
 gone. So that's a really weird thing to look at a body when no soul, but your blood settles,

72
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,800
 your bloat in certain weird places, fluids collect and all sorts of stuff. You're not

73
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,460
 going to have the same rosy cheeks you had in your mugshot photo when you're laying

74
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,940
 down lifeless on a gurney. But people say no, no, no. See, they cloned Jeffrey Epstein

75
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,940
 and put the clone on a gurney and then they let Jeffrey Epstein out because he's so good

76
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,900
 at providing the elites with these kids that we need him on the outside. So let me ask

77
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,460
 you guys, anyone who believes in that theory or when you come across, because this theory

78
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,000
 will take off, trust me, I believe this is a very, very up and coming conspiracy theory.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,640
 This is why I want you to ask those people. You can run into them, you're at Starbucks,

80
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,320
 you're drinking your coffee. So I'm going to walk, say, with a shirt that says, "I cloned

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,240
 Jeffrey Epstein and all I got was his lousy t-shirt." And you go, "Hey, hey, can I talk

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,600
 to you about your conspiracy theory?" And they're like, "Someone's paying attention

83
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
 to me?" Yeah, and they sit down next to you and they're taking a bunch of Splendor packets

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
 and putting it in their coffee. That's what I do. I don't know why I attributed him that.

85
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,380
 I just take like five Splendor packets. But anyways, he goes, "Yes, yes, here, you want

86
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,300
 to hear my conspiracy theory?" "Jeffrey Epstein was cloned and then he tells you the whole

87
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,380
 nonsense that I just told you." These are your questions you should ask. First off,

88
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,740
 who cloned him? When did we get cloning technology? How did they sneak the clone into the jail

89
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,140
 and him out of the jail? Those are all valid questions. If he was cloned, why didn't they

90
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,900
 clone him on the outside and have his clone get arrested in the first place? Why would

91
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:18,160
 you need him to get young girls when alone America has a huge human trafficking problem

92
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
 and a huge subset of that is children? So it's not like there's just one guy in the

93
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,920
 country who can do it. You can go to pretty much any major city, talk to three or four

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,000
 pimps and find what you're looking for. That's not a selling point. It's absolutely tragic,

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,440
 but America has a huge human trafficking problem. Why would you need this guy? If you had the

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,420
 ability to clone people, let's go with this. At this point, the guy's getting a little

97
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,380
 nervous. He's slowly stirring his coffee. He's looking from side to side trying to plot his

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:53,060
 escape. If you can clone people, why would you clone the pimp? Wouldn't you clone the

99
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,820
 prostitutes? Wouldn't you clone the victims and then you wouldn't ever have to worry about

100
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,260
 anything? You wouldn't have to have a new pimp go out and find a new girl. You'd have

101
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,480
 a hundred versions of the same girl. I think one of the big problems with conspiracy theory

102
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,760
 is that it's not questioned enough. Most people, when they hear ridiculous conspiracy theories,

103
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,800
 they just let them stand. They go, "Ah, what? You're an idiot." And they just walk away.

104
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,120
 And then the person is allowed to exist in their echo chamber and stuff never gets questioned.

105
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,000
 Sometimes we should take our time out to actually argue these things down. Really, we really

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,240
 should, even if it's just five or ten minutes a day. I used to do that all the time. I used

107
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,260
 to debate people who didn't believe we landed on the moon. I'd debate them until the cows

108
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,380
 came home. I thought it was the funniest thing in the world to debate people who don't believe

109
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,420
 we landed on the moon. It's one of the easiest things to debate. And here's the way to do

110
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,820
 it. Just ask questions. If you start presenting other facts, which is generally how we win

111
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,100
 arguments, and someone says, "Hey, we never landed on the moon." And you go, "Well, we

112
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,900
 took photos. Like, there's photos of the moon." And we were up there and people were bringing

113
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,100
 back rocks, explaining the rocks and stuff like that. And there's like, you're presenting

114
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,760
 them with facts. The best thing to do is, what I always do is go, "Who would make it

115
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,680
 up?" And they'd answer that. And there's obviously a logical flaw in it, because it's not true.

116
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,840
 We did land on the moon. Who would make that up? Well, NASA's a satanic organization that

117
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,080
 said, "Oh, okay." And then you can start to take apart their argument. You don't want

118
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,280
 to present an argument to them, because they will have an argumentative book. They've already

119
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,000
 talked to all their friends, so they know how to argue stuff like, "Why are there no stars

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,220
 on the moon?" You know why there's no stars on the moon, like in those moon photos? Because

121
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,540
 they were taken during the day. But they'll say, if I presented that fact to them, they'll

122
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,740
 just be, "Oh, no, NASA airbrushed out the... I don't know how I got on the moon land."

123
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,020
 And they're talking about Jeffrey Epstein. But the point is, is like, if you present

124
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,780
 a fact, they'll have a counterfact for you, and they'll just disregard the fact. The point

125
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,820
 is, is to make a conspiracy theorist's brain start to work. You're basically the jumper

126
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,940
 cables trying to get that car started. Why would they make it up? Why didn't the Russians

127
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,560
 cover it up for them? They say, "Because we paid the Russians off in wheat, because they're

128
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
 having a huge food shortage." And I go, "Yeah, that normally works with other countries,

129
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,160
 when we pay them off with money." Like, if North Korea says, "We won't build nukes if

130
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,080
 you give us money, and we give them money, and then two years later they're building

131
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,680
 a nuke," that works, right? But before I let them answer that, I'll ask them another question

132
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,720
 about what they're talking about. And you just are getting that, their brain to start

133
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,800
 to think, "That is a little weird." Like, let's say we did give the Russians a bunch

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,420
 of wheat, so we'd union a bunch of wheat so they would lie about the moon landing. Why

135
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,540
 would they keep that secret for the next 60 years? And they start, you know, get those

136
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,780
 gears turning. Why is NASA a, if NASA is a satanic organization, what about India's

137
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,780
 space program? What about China's space program? You can do that with any conspiracy theory.

138
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,900
 When someone presents a ridiculous conspiracy theory to you, simply ask questions. Simply

139
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,460
 just ask question after question after question, and then you're allowed to walk away at any

140
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,960
 point. When you're a time is more valuable than talking to that lunatic, but it makes

141
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,200
 them think. If you present them with facts, they'll just shut down. They'll be like, "No,

142
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,080
 no, it's a satanic conspiracy." Okay, give me some names of people who started this satanic

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,200
 conspiracy. Where did this person get their satanic training? Where did you get this information

144
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,440
 from? And you just keep asking them questions, and eventually they'll get to a point where

145
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,880
 they don't have an answer. And that's the ultimate weapon against ridiculous conspiracy

146
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,200
 theories like Jeffrey Epstein being cloned. A lot of times people who put out conspiracy

147
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,180
 theories go, "Hey man, I'm just asking questions. I'm not being disrespectful to 9/11 victims.

148
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,340
 I'm simply asking questions." So that's what we can do too, is ask questions as well. That

149
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,220
 thing right there was infinitely more entertaining than 15 minutes of me going through the Jeffrey

150
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,820
 Epstein case. So we're going to go ahead and jump back into the story. You're going to

151
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,340
 hear me go, "Blech!" as I finish up the Jeffrey Epstein story, and let's go to Bolivia. Let

152
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,680
 us hop on board the Carbonercopter and head to Bolivia. But first, you're going to hear

153
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,920
 this. "Blech!" We're done with that story. Which I'm sure you guys are all relieved of.

154
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,520
 I mean, you know, no one likes talking about this stuff, but it's such big news. I had

155
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,800
 to cover it. So let's all hop on board the Carbonercopter. Let's get on board. We are

156
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,240
 flying out to Bolivia, and we are about to explore probably one of my new favorite stories

157
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,080
 that I've found. I never knew this story existed until probably Thursday, and I was immediately

158
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,140
 like, "This is dope, dude. This is really cool." So we are flying to Bolivia. So we're all

159
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,020
 on board the Carbonercopter. And as we're flying out, we're going to go back in time

160
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:39,180
 as we usually do. Then we reappear, and we are in Opalco, Bolivia. Very, very poor region.

161
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,940
 At least back then. I don't know. It could be bustling metropolis now, but it used to

162
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,680
 be really, really poor. Okay? And there was this girl named Valentina Flores, 24-year-old

163
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
 mom, mom, single mother. No, she wasn't single mother. She just had one baby. That's what

164
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,280
 I meant. She's not walking around one day. She leaves the house. She's kind of just walking

165
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,160
 around. She has no friends. There's no one else living in the area. Her husband's off

166
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,320
 doing work for the government. Because they're super poor, and she stays home in farms, and

167
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,840
 he goes and basically the government's like, "Do this," and he'd get up and go do it,

168
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,920
 and then get paid. Not a lot of money, though. They're poor. And she's walking around outside

169
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,300
 and someone throws a bowl of blood at her. And she's like, "The worst prank ever." I

170
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,700
 mean, I get cream pies, her little cliche, but a bowl of blood is a tall escalation.

171
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,580
 So she gets covered in blood. She's like, "What?" And when she finally wipes the blood

172
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,180
 from her eyes, she's like, "Aww, you knucklehead!" She's getting ready to bonk him on the head.

173
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,220
 No one's there. No one's there. And she's like, "That's weird." I mean, the blood part

174
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,040
 was weird, too, but the disappearing act, quite odd. Now we're going to jump ahead. That

175
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,160
 happened a few days before this event. Now, your skeptic alarms are going to be going

176
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,120
 off this whole story. This whole story, because mine were two. So let me get into this real

177
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,240
 quick. I've tried really, really hard to debunk this. There's basically two types of made-up

178
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,120
 stories when we deal with the show. One, the person who's telling the story totally made

179
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,540
 it up, which is possible, obviously. And the second one, which is more troubling, is the

180
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,020
 internet made it up. That was something we came across when I covered the Lone Pine Devils.

181
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,620
 And then a listener, I don't remember their name, I'm so sorry, but I mentioned it on

182
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,540
 the episode that I corrected it on. A listener said, "That story is completely made up.

183
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,500
 It's based on this YouTube video." And sure enough, there was not a single mention of

184
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,100
 this story of the Lone Pine Devils before the YouTube video. So when I started to look

185
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,860
 into this, I go, "I can't prove whether or not she made it up. That's pretty hard."

186
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,680
 But I can assure you that this story is not created by the internet. I tracked this story

187
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,160
 came out in 2001 from a Spanish book, and the first mention of it online is like August

188
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,080
 2001, and it was mentioned in this context. So she could have made it up, but it's not

189
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,480
 an urban legend that was made up on the internet that everyone just repeats and passes around.

190
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,880
 I'm shocked this story isn't more famous, but let's go ahead and get into it. So I want

191
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,600
 you to put peace of mind that I've done my due diligence to see whether or not this is

192
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,660
 fake. She could have made it up, but we'll accept her out of her word as we tell this

193
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,100
 story of Valentina. So it's May... This is going to set off your skeptic alarms, too.

194
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:21,340
 It's either May 10th or May 14th in the year 1967 or 1968. So that, again, set off my skeptic

195
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,220
 alarm. But considering it's such a rural region, she's illiterate. She's from an indigenous

196
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,060
 Indian tribe known as the Kuikua tribe of Indians in Bolivia. So it's not like they

197
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,340
 have a farmer's almanac hanging out. I'll accept that the dates differ from different

198
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,080
 versions of this story, but most of the details are the same. Okay, so we got all of that

199
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,840
 out of the way. Now you can take off your skeptic hats and enjoy this story. So Valentina

200
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,080
 Flores is 24 years old, and her husband's off again working for the government. So she's

201
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,120
 there, and it's her job to, one, take care of their precious little infant baby, little

202
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,820
 baby on her back. She has like a... One of those things that wraps around your front,

203
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,460
 and then there's like a little baby chilling in the back with a bow and arrow. What were

204
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,580
 those things? Weren't there bamboo shkas or something like that? I don't know. Anyways,

205
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,780
 this one is called a manta in this part of the world. But anyway, so she's hanging out

206
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,540
 there, her baby's on her back, and she has 64 sheep and a bunch of llamas. And this is

207
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,820
 how they make their money. They have to have the sheep for the wool, and they make stuff

208
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,540
 or sell the wool or whatever. The sheeps are a big part of their livelihood, so are the

209
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,640
 llamas. So this is basically what would be the equivalent of, you weren't going to bank,

210
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,740
 but your money can walk away at any time or be eaten by wolves at any time. So she's always

211
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,280
 constantly having to keep an eye on her business. There's a bunch of livestock. So she's walking

212
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,040
 around with her baby on her back, taking care of farm stuff, right? I've never been to a

213
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,280
 farm. I don't know what they do, but anyways, she's doing stereotypical farm stuff. She's

214
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,160
 throwing hay, building houses, watching sheep. But then she realizes, she turns around and

215
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,260
 she realizes all the llamas are gone. She's like, "Dagnabbit, if I ain't never seen nothing

216
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,060
 worse than that." And so she starts stomping on, she gets into her jalapeno. And so the

217
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,220
 llamas are completely gone. She throws her hat in the dirt, she's stepping on it. And

218
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,540
 so she starts trying to find the llamas. So she starts walking all over, it's like a real

219
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,760
 hilly region. She starts walking all over the hills, she's like, "Llamas." It's a 45-minute

220
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,700
 walk before she finally finds her herd of llamas. So at this point, she's very, very

221
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,880
 upset. And she herds them back, she brings them all back, and she's like, "Let's get

222
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 back to the house. I got 64 sheep to take care of." But as she starts to come over

223
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,920
 a hill with all of her llamas, she notices something really, really weird. So she put

224
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,120
 the sheep in this stone corral before she left. But as she's coming over the hill with

225
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,840
 her army of llamas, she sees something covering up the stone corral. And she noticed it looks,

226
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,560
 the way she described it was, there was a pipe sticking out of the top, and then this

227
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:58,860
 plastic web-like coating, almost like a circus tent coming out of the top of the pipe and

228
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,260
 covering the entire corral. So she can't really see what's in the corral. And she's

229
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,820
 like, "I didn't leave that there. That's not mine, right? Who is messing with my sheep?"

230
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,780
 So she kind of like puts down, she's like, "Llamas, stay here." She holds her hand up

231
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,620
 so they all stop. And she's like doing the army belly curl. She comes around and she

232
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,800
 looks into basically a tent flap of the tent, of the big plastic thing that's covering

233
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,240
 her corral. And what she sees is shocking. So she looks in, she's like a little boy,

234
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,880
 like a little boy sneaking in the circus. She like peeks in, trying to see like an elephant.

235
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,280
 She sees a three-foot-tall man in there, this little white dude, this little white guy with

236
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:47,280
 blonde hair, blue eyes, and a giant red mustache. He's described as chubby and young. So imagine

237
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,180
 me with a mustache for the rest of the... Imagine 12-year-old Jason, I wasn't three feet tall,

238
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,500
 I don't think, but imagine 12-year-old Jason for the rest of this story, the giant mustache.

239
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,240
 The little chubby boy, sitting inside this tent. But it's not just me and a tent. What

240
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:11,860
 she sees is me and a tent surrounded by 63 slaughtered sheep. Just guts hanging out, jaw

241
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,560
 bones missing, eyeballs gone. It looks like a horror movie, except this horror movie is

242
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,520
 her livelihood. And as she's looking in, she sees chubby little man have a chain attached

243
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,740
 to like a belt. And on the end of the chain is this large hook that he's been using to

244
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:38,040
 cut the sheep open. And on both sides of the boy, he had two plastic satchels filled with

245
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,640
 sheep guts. Now, again, let's put our skeptic hats on for a second. I don't care how big

246
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,080
 the satchels are or what you're pulling out of sheep. I don't think you can fit 63 of

247
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,960
 anything, anything's guts, in two side satchels. I just don't think that's possible. But let's

248
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,160
 take our skeptic hats back off. And he's about to kill her last sheep. And she flips out.

249
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,300
 Right? She totally loses it. So she picks a rock up and she throws it at little dude

250
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:14,480
 and hits him in the head. And she's throwing rocks at him and he's yelling at her in a

251
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,560
 language she doesn't understand. And she just, she doesn't care at this point. She's seeing

252
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,800
 all of her sheep killed. She begins just picking up rocks and throwing them at her. And the

253
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,840
 little dude's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And eventually the little dude's had enough

254
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,280
 of it. He goes and he starts winding this thing up there. She said, look like a radio,

255
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,700
 like just basically was a box. And as he's winding it up, the plastic tent over the,

256
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,260
 I know the story sounds insane, but I love it. The plastic tent over the corral basically

257
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,820
 winds up and gets sucked into the metal pole that was sitting in the middle of her farm.

258
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,860
 At that point, she sees a second three foot tall chubby little boy on the opposite side

259
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,100
 of the corral that was blocked from view because of the tent. The second dude sees her, sees

260
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,480
 what's going on and books it, dude. He just goes in the opposite direction, starts running

261
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,160
 away as fast as his chubby little legs can take him. Then he sits down in a chair and

262
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,600
 hits a button and these propellers start going off. And the chair goes, and she just

263
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,200
 flies away, leaves his dude there who's being assaulted by this woman. So the dude looks

264
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,360
 at her and she looks at him and he's in this stone corral surrounded by dead sheep, gutted

265
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,380
 sheep and the sheep he was going to cut open and run away at this point. He's like, thanks,

266
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,620
 gives Valentina high five, books it hangs out with the llamas who must be terrified by this

267
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,020
 whole situation. Little dude's looking at her, she's looking at him, she goes, let's

268
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,660
 rock. And everyone's like, yeah, yeah. Just like episode of married children, this one's

269
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,180
 a little more violent. She ends up pulling out a club. She keeps a cudgel with her, right?

270
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,160
 She like pulls it out, spins it around in her hand, spinning it over her head like an

271
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,960
 ninja. It's a wooden club that has a iron tip to it and she steps into the corral, stepping

272
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,480
 over sheep carcasses, flies must be everywhere at this point. Little guy's looking up at

273
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,480
 her and he's like, uh-oh, this is not going to end well. And she bashes this dude over

274
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,600
 the head. Now I should say right now, it wasn't actually two chubby boys who had wandered

275
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,100
 into her carral and just started getting sheep. It wasn't, so yeah, it was just two little

276
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,580
 boys were hanging out on their property killing sheep, which would deserve a butt kicking.

277
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,060
 But the implication of these kids are aliens. I hope you guys picked up on that as this

278
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,780
 next part starts. She picks up her, she has her cudgel and she bashes this dude right in

279
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,300
 the face and he's trying to talk to her the whole time in this language that she just

280
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,920
 doesn't understand at all. Well, no matter what he was saying, we're trying to cure,

281
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,280
 we're trying to help the environment with those hippie aliens that are trying to help

282
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,600
 everything. No, we have to kill 64 sheep or your world will be doomed. It wouldn't matter.

283
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,380
 It was her livelihood. She bashes him in the face and he just starts leaking. He just starts

284
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,320
 bleeding all over the place and at this point he's screaming at her and she goes for another

285
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,880
 blow, right? She's just brain this kid and the hook thing he has attached to the chain,

286
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,420
 he picks it up. It was originally designed to kill sheep, to gut sheep. He throws it

287
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,540
 at her and she tries to do a matrix dodge. It doesn't work. It actually hits her and

288
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:36,020
 cuts her chest and then as it's like going up, he throws it and it flies back to him because

289
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,020
 he pulls it on the chain. But as it's making that arc, it basically hits her chest, cuts

290
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,820
 her chest, cuts her face and then comes back to him and then he's like spinning it and

291
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,500
 he's like, you want to go again? You understood that, right? You understood that? And she's

292
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,280
 standing there. She's all cut up and she said, "I think it would have went straight into

293
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,840
 me if I wasn't wearing the manta that was holding the baby on you on the back." And

294
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,000
 I'm assuming the baby is wide awake and screaming at this point because basically everything

295
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,760
 that could go wrong is going wrong. As he's getting ready to do another throw of this

296
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:12,280
 thing, she takes her cudgel and she smashes his hand so badly. Again, this isn't a put

297
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,520
 on a skeptic hat for a second. This is something that if you were an alien, you'd have to be

298
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,660
 pretty weak. She hits his arm, his right arm so badly that it begins bleeding and is immediately

299
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,700
 immobilized. Like, I can imagine getting hit so hard in the arm it gets broke and then

300
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,620
 you can't use it, but I've had quite a few broken bones. I've never bled, to be fair,

301
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,060
 I've never been hit with an iron cudgel, but anyway, she just smashes his arm. He's screaming.

302
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,980
 His face is bleeding, his arm is bleeding. He's like, "I'm out of here." He runs, he

303
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,760
 gets in a chair as well, hits a button, flies off after his buddy. Her husband comes back,

304
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,540
 "Where's all of her sheep? What you do?" And she's like, "You won't believe the day

305
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,040
 I had." She's in there drinking whiskey. He's like, "That's all the whiskey we have."

306
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,240
 She's like, "Yeah, well, I need it." She tells him the story. Eventually the

307
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,520
 blivvy army gets notified. They come out and they collect the carcasses of all the sheep

308
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,040
 and they also scrape up the ground where these weird creatures had been to get the blood.

309
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,460
 I shouldn't have that. They weren't just scraping up dirt. They scraped up where the

310
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,500
 aliens' blood had dropped and then they left. Now, this incident devastated the farm so

311
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:27,420
 badly that Valentina and her little baby and her husband had to move away to another

312
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,780
 town. They couldn't be up here anymore because they didn't have any reason to be up there.

313
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,660
 All of their sheep had died. Alamas, they're just like, "You're lame. You're not good

314
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:41,100
 enough." And that all happened in 1967. In 2001, a famous Spanish author and UFO investigator

315
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,840
 named JJ Benitez found out about this story and was able to track her down. She was in

316
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,400
 another region and she's like, "Oh yeah. Come and take a seat. Talk to you about this

317
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,280
 stuff." And she's telling him the story and he goes, "Oh yeah. You know, cattle mutilations

318
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,460
 are a thing and these are..." Which is funny because I talk trash about cattle mutilations

319
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,840
 all the time but I love this story. He's like, "You know, cattle mutilations are a thing

320
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,280
 and UFOs come down and they abduct them." And as he's telling her all this stuff, she's

321
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,500
 just sitting there drinking tea. She goes, "I don't care. I don't care. I don't care

322
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,220
 about UFOs. I don't care about aliens. All I care about is that all my sheep got killed."

323
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,020
 She was illiterate. The whole family was illiterate. The baby was illiterate, obviously. And even

324
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,260
 in 2001, she had never looked into UFOology. She didn't care about aliens. She thought all

325
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:31,260
 that stuff was just like whatever. I don't care. Don't tell me about it. It means nothing

326
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,260
 to me. Which is an interesting thing because we've covered stuff like that before where

327
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,080
 people who've had close encounters with alien life who don't have any idea of what aliens

328
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,320
 are or flying saucers and stuff like that. So is this a genuine case of cattle mutilation?

329
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,960
 I'm not for sure. I think it's fascinating because most cattle mutilation takes place

330
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
 out of sight. They just find cows or find human bodies or whatever it is and they're

331
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,000
 like, "Ah, aliens." But this is a story. This is the only one that I've ever seen of someone

332
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,500
 actually watching the aliens mutilate livestock. Which is an interesting spin on it. But I

333
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,740
 find the story fascinating. I find the story fascinating nonetheless. And that's one of

334
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,380
 the fun things about doing this show is I'll talk trash about all sorts of stories that

335
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,500
 have tons of sources. And every show often I'll come across a very intriguing story that

336
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,140
 has one source that was, you know, 50, 60 years ago. And I'm just like, "Oh, the story's

337
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,500
 awesome." Stories where people beat up aliens might be my favorite. This is the second one

338
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,660
 now I found. A couple episodes ago we did the Finland special and that involved the

339
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,340
 lumberjack chasing an alien away with a chainsaw. Which I found infinitely amusing and this

340
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,680
 one's even better because she totally beat it up. And I have to add, actually, I forgot

341
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,960
 to add this. This is another thing. You know, the beginning I had to add in later. I realized

342
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,520
 I forgot this. The bucket of blood. The bowl of blood, right? I started off the story with

343
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,720
 that. She doesn't know, even after all the stories, she doesn't know, nobody knows who

344
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,820
 threw the bowl of blood on her. It's a total mystery. Was it related to the aliens? Who

345
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,020
 knows? Was it alien blood? Who knows? Was it some sort of portent? Was it some sort of

346
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,340
 foreshadowing that she was going to have this alien encounter and drenched in blood? Nobody

347
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,780
 knows. I like to imagine that somewhere out there in the cosmos, there's a race of chubby

348
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,740
 little, chubby little alien people on the planet Chubbular. All the buildings are made

349
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,320
 out of sheep guts. They're walking around and eventually these spaceship goes lands,

350
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,000
 right? Two flying chairs come out of it. No, one flying chair and it's soon on a flying

351
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,280
 stretcher. Everyone's like, "What happened? What happened to you guys? Did you guys bring

352
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,000
 our new building material?" The dude's like, "Oh dude, shut up. I need to go to the doctor."

353
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
 So he goes to the doctor and eventually all their scientists, military officials are

354
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,400
 talking to Tiny Jason. You won't believe it, man. I'm standing there. We have the best

355
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,940
 technology in the world. We can travel the cosmos. He just gave me a hook to defend myself

356
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,300
 and they're like, "That's all you should need, sir." Not sir. You lost. You got demoted,

357
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,060
 private and he's like, "Uh." And then they're like, "So what happened?" He's like, "Well,

358
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,220
 there's this woman. She's an average sized woman, so she's like five foot six." And they're

359
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,500
 like, "Oh my God, they're all giants there." He's like, "They are." She begins picking

360
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,380
 up rocks, throwing them at me. That was the extent of her skills. And then she beat me

361
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,520
 up with a big old stick. Big old stick. And they're like, "A stick did this to you."

362
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,160
 And he's like, "Yes." A stick wielded by a giant. And then he's like, "Give me more

363
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,520
 pain medication. I'll tell you more." You give me a little bit more of that delicious

364
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,000
 alien pain medication. I'll tell you more. But eventually her story would have become

365
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,360
 legend on Chubb Ular. This feisty young woman with a baby strapped to her back beat back

366
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,320
 alien invaders. The moral of the story is don't mess with earth. The moral of the story

367
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,660
 actually is don't be afraid of aliens, because I have a lot of friends who are afraid of

368
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,780
 aliens. Because aliens for all their spaceships and their psychic powers and their big old

369
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,340
 reptilian bodies or little gray bodies or chubby bodies in this case, they're still flesh

370
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:08,020
 and bone. And flesh can be torn and bone can be broken. Earth. Earth. Earth. Or I want

371
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,540
 you to say with me, I want you to know that you do not mess with planet earth. Because

372
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:19,320
 at any point in time, we can reach down and pick up a rock. It's on. Aliens. I challenge

373
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,240
 you. Every so often I do an episode like this, I think, "What if I get abducted by aliens

374
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,880
 tonight?" Like, what if they're like, "Okay, we're done with this. This guy's talking so

375
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,440
 much trash about us." The intergalactic war may have started in 1967 when a woman bashed

376
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:59,940
 an alien's head. And if that story is true, we're well on our way to victory.
