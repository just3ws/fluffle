1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 Is a drug addiction actually a pathway to the fountain of youth?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,120
 What would you do if you woke up one night paralyzed as a shadow man stands over you?

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,780
 And then we traveled to the year 1971 to meet a man who made a movie about the Zodiac killer.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,460
 But he didn't make it for money.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,560
 He made it to lay a trap for one of America's most notorious freaks today on Dead Rabbit

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
 Radio.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,560
 I'm a wild freak down.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,560
 Actually I'm a wild freak down.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,680
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,120
 I just had an image of me doing the show on camera.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,800
 Doing the show in front of a video camera.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,520
 Maybe a live studio audience.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,800
 And I break through the wall.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 Like there's just like, you guys know what a wall is?

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 It's a barrier.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,520
 I break through the wall and go, hey everyone welcome back to another episode.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,720
 Wouldn't that be awesome?

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 Every episode.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 A brand new wall.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,360
 And on the wall is like a picture of the stories I'm going to cover.

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
 That'd be dope.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,640
 Hey Netflix, Netflix give me a call if you want to sponsor that show.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,160
 It's going to break a lot of barriers.

27
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,920
 Get it?

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,840
 And breaking through that wall right now as well is one of our legacy patreons Eva Marie

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
 Richardson.

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
 She comes smashing through that wall.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
 Give her a round of applause.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,160
 Eva you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,480
 You can't break through a wall.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,640
 If you can't support the Patreon that's fine too.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,480
 Just help get the word out about the show.

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,040
 Really really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
 Just break into people's houses.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,920
 Just kick down their doors and be like, hey dude you got to listen to this show.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,480
 There's walls for everyone to break.

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,200
 Eva Marie, let's hop in the bunny bulldozer.

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,960
 We are headed out to the fountain of youth.

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
 We're going to bulldoze.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
 We're totally going to smash it.

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,900
 We all got our hard hats on.

45
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,640
 We see this beautiful little fountain in the middle of Florida.

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
 Smash it.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
 We don't need the fountain of youth because it already exists at your local pharmacy.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
 I was on Reddit the other day.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,680
 This was a while back actually.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 I found this one.

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
 And I was on the opiate subreddit.

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,860
 Everyone knows if you listen to the show for more than a week, I have this weird obsession

53
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,600
 with going to drug subreddits and read about people.

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,280
 The other day this guy posted, he was on the meth subreddit and he posted that he was having

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
 sex with a ghost.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,080
 He had been up for five days.

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
 He was having sex with a ghost.

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,160
 And him and the ghost and some other spirits were going to help save the world.

59
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,120
 And the other meth addicts on the board were like, dude get some sleep.

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
 You need to go to sleep.

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,680
 You've been up for five days.

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,800
 You're not having sex with a ghost.

63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
 And they're giving him advice.

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
 Their advice is basically take a break from the meth.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,720
 And after about four or five people telling him he needs to go to sleep, his final post

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,800
 for the night was help.

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,520
 His final post for the night was help the ghost are chasing me.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,600
 And the response to that one was dude get some sleep.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,360
 First off the fact that other meth addicts are telling you to take a break.

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
 It's hilarious.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
 Secondly, what does he think these people can do for him?

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
 If the ghost are chasing him around his house and he posted on Reddit, what is another

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,200
 redditor supposed to do?

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
 But anyways, I have so much fun.

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
 I go to the drug subreddits all the time.

76
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
 I found this one on the opiate subreddit a while back.

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,680
 This post said, "Does anyone else feel like opiates actually prevent aging?"

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,840
 And this reddit post about opiates was from rate me throwaway68.

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,680
 It's a throwaway account, but I still want to give credit for at least bringing it to

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
 my attention.

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,040
 It's a very weird story.

82
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,560
 People begin posting stories that they do look younger than they should.

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,080
 A lot of them are like, "Yeah, it's really weird I still get caught.

84
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,720
 I've been using opiates since I was a teenager in my early 20s.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,360
 I still look like I'm in my early 20s.

86
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
 I'm like 35, 40.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
 I still get carded."

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,800
 So they started trading stories and they started to say, "I do look much younger."

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,520
 When you look at people who are smokers or alcoholics, they tend to look older than

90
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,160
 they actually are.

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,880
 But opiate users, people who are using heroin, hydromorphone, fentanyl, stuff like that, they

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,080
 look younger than they should.

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,760
 If you're using fentanyl, you're basically going to look the age where you took it and

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
 you died.

95
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,200
 But for the average heroin user, they said they do tend to look younger.

96
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 And there were some people who said, "No, no, that's not the case.

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
 I actually look much older."

98
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,640
 But by a considerably large margin, people were saying they looked younger.

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
 Anecdotal, obviously.

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,720
 You have a sample group of people who are doing opiates so much they're on the opiate

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
 subreddit.

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,560
 They actually started throwing out a couple different theories.

103
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,000
 One of them was opiate slowdown your breathing, slowdown your metabolism.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,720
 The reason why I wanted to do this story today was it kind of plays in a yesterday's story

105
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,120
 about oxygen is poison.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,680
 They're saying that because you were breathing less, your metabolism slower because it does

107
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
 slow you.

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,440
 That's what kills you with the opioid overdose.

109
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
 You basically just stop breathing.

110
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,600
 Your metabolism shuts down, respiratory distress.

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
 So it actually, they're saying that that slows down the aging process.

112
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,280
 That's not why, though.

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,360
 Another theory was that actually when you do opioids, your life is just less stressful.

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,920
 You're in a state of bliss.

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,800
 When you're high on opioids, the second you're not high on opioids, you're concerned about

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
 getting more opioids.

117
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,440
 So that would counterbalance it.

118
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,360
 It's a very like super stressed.

119
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,400
 Super stressed.

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,800
 So it's not a, it's not, I'd say even the stress would be higher.

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,840
 Than the four to eight hours where you're not stressed.

122
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,720
 Then you're stressed for even longer, trying to get it or worried about getting more and

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 stuff like that.

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
 But I was looking at this and I go, that is something that, there were so many people

125
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
 saying that that was the case.

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
 They're like, yeah, I'm an opioid addict.

127
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,360
 I've been an opioid addict for 10 years.

128
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,000
 It looks like I stopped aging 10 years ago.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,280
 There were so many people saying that that I wanted to do some additional research.

130
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,920
 So I went out and bought a ton of heroin.

131
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,120
 I don't look a day older than the two weeks ago when I first took it.

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,560
 I found this research paper, opioids and skin homeostasis regeneration and aging.

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
 What's the evidence?

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,040
 It's the name of this article.

135
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:32,600
 They say that yes, doing opioids actually slows down the aging process.

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,080
 There's little asterisks there.

137
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,720
 Long-term heroin use will actually age your brain on a cellular level.

138
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,120
 Your brain will appear to be an older person's brain.

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,880
 Long-term heroin use does brain damage.

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,520
 But opioids, and that includes heroin outside of the brain, outside of that very important

141
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,600
 organ, it affects the skin.

142
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 And that's why you itch.

143
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,120
 When you take a lot of opioids, your skin will start to itch.

144
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,040
 That's your skin actually reacting to an element in a painkiller.

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,000
 The article goes on for a bunch of science-y stuff that I don't really understand, but

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
 the gist is this.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,160
 It actually does repair the skin.

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,380
 Your skin reacts to any sort of opioids.

149
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,600
 That scratching, that itching is basically your skin.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,280
 It's working some sort of magic on there.

151
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
 Some sort of voodoo science magic.

152
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
 And they said it actually does affect the skin.

153
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
 It can heal the skin.

154
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,760
 In fact, there are groups right now that are trying to figure out a way to turn an opioid

155
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,520
 into a topical cream.

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,080
 It's that effective in slowing the aging process.

157
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,520
 There are companies right now thinking, if we can take an opioid, turn it into a topical,

158
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,920
 make it so you don't get high, because otherwise the government will never allow it.

159
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,000
 But we could make a cream, rub it on your skin, it would actually make you look younger.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
 A true fountain of youth.

161
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,880
 It's been tested in the streets all over America.

162
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,480
 People who are doing opioids look the age they were when they started doing the opioids.

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
 Unless they're like six.

164
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,600
 There's not like a six year old guy walking around with a machine gun.

165
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 He's some drug dealer.

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 But it slows your aging process down so much that it's a visible change.

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,960
 And companies right now are trying to figure out a way to turn that into a topical cream.

168
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
 It works that well.

169
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,720
 This is not an advocacy thing for painkiller abuse, but every thorn has its rows.

170
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,160
 You like that?

171
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
 You like that?

172
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,960
 Eva Marie, fire up that dead rabbit dirgeable.

173
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,040
 We are leaving behind this tin of really young looking junkies.

174
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,720
 And we are headed out to Annapolis, Maryland.

175
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,360
 Dead rabbit dirgeables flying over the landscape.

176
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,320
 And we see a little building.

177
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 It's not a little building.

178
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 It's actually a massive complex.

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,280
 But you see a campus out there, and it's the US Naval Academy.

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,360
 So we're now wearing our suits.

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
 We all look like Cadet Kelly.

182
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,160
 That's an old reference.

183
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,240
 We got a little scarf.

184
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,760
 We got the normal little naval suit.

185
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
 And then we got a little scarf to accessorize it.

186
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,360
 So we get up to the dead rabbit dirgeable and we're marching information and all that

187
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,680
 stuff because really we want to get into the woman's dormitory.

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,120
 Now I know that sounds weird.

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,360
 That's where this story takes place.

190
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,720
 This isn't a panty raid or something like that.

191
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,020
 We need to go into the woman's dormitory.

192
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,280
 So in our Cadet Kelly uniforms, they totally let us in.

193
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,240
 And there we're going to meet a young woman.

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,360
 We don't have her real name, so we're going to call her Kimberly.

195
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,840
 So Kimberly and her roommate, Becca, are both members of the US Naval Academy.

196
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,080
 And when they're roommates, Kimberly realizes real quickly she shares a room with Becca.

197
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,960
 Kimberly realizes pretty early on that Becca has some sleep issues.

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,080
 Becca talks in her sleep.

199
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,560
 Not all the time, but it's not rare either.

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,160
 But we do know that Becca would have sleep disturbances.

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,800
 She would talk in her sleep and she would do weird things at night.

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,280
 That she would go, "I was asleep.

203
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,240
 I must have been sleepwalking or something like that."

204
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,000
 Anyways, the point is that she was a big weirdo at night.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,520
 Well, one night Kimberly's sleeping in bed and she wakes with a start and she can't

206
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,160
 move.

207
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,000
 She's completely frozen in place.

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,880
 She's never suffered sleep paralysis before, but she had heard of it.

209
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,960
 Most people are familiar with it.

210
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,040
 Even if they've never had it happen to them.

211
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,920
 I don't think I've had it happen to me.

212
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,160
 I could be wrong about that.

213
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,600
 I could have had it happen and forgotten, but she realizes immediately what it is.

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,160
 She's trying to be really rational about it.

215
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,760
 She can't move her body.

216
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:51,280
 And she begins to hear demonic voices from all around her.

217
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:59,200
 Now she's used to hearing her roommate talking in the middle of the night, but this is different

218
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,720
 because her roommate, even though she may be saying a bunch of weird stuff, she doesn't

219
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
 sound like a demon.

220
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
 It's a different thing.

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,960
 It's a different voice, but she's thinking, "I'm just having sleep paralysis.

222
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,360
 I'm in between being awake and being asleep.

223
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,040
 This is totally normal.

224
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,840
 There's not really demons around me."

225
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,960
 And then that's when she sees a shadowy figure standing next to her bed.

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,000
 And she's completely paralyzed, and she's trying to convince herself this isn't real.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,920
 I mean, it's real in the sense that I'm awake, but these are some sort of visual disturbances,

228
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,680
 and I can't move, and I understand the science behind this, and she's continuing to hear

229
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,640
 these voices.

230
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,760
 And she's forcing herself to be able to move.

231
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,240
 She's wiggling her toes.

232
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,040
 She's moving her legs.

233
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,640
 And once she's able to regain control of her body, she rolls over on her side.

234
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
 The paralysis is gone.

235
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,480
 The voices are gone.

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,720
 The shadow man is gone.

237
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,600
 And now she's looking right over at her roommate's bed, and her roommate is on all fours.

238
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:20,000
 "Kackling in the darkness.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,920
 Kimberly gets up out of bed and wanders the halls of the dormitory until she's calmed

240
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,480
 down enough to go back to sleep."

241
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,960
 I found this story on Reddit as well.

242
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,600
 This was from a user named BearR.

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,400
 And she was repeating the story that her little sister had told her who's at the US Naval Academy.

244
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,440
 Just happened this year.

245
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,840
 She said my little sister was walking around the Naval Academy and I was on the phone with

246
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,880
 her, and she was saying how she felt the whole complex was haunted.

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,720
 She felt that you'd walk around these buildings, you'd always feel like you weren't alone.

248
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,320
 You felt that uneasy feeling, and then she told this story to her sister about what had

249
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
 happened just a few nights before.

250
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,680
 It's interesting because we do understand the science of sleep paralysis.

251
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,560
 It doesn't make it any less disconcerting when these things are happening to you.

252
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,640
 I like this story because we have the combination of a typical sleep paralysis thing, which

253
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,560
 are already creepy.

254
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,480
 You can't move your body, and we understand the science behind it, right?

255
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,080
 Your mind wakes up, your body thinks it's still asleep.

256
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,160
 Our bodies actually go prone while we're asleep, so we don't act out our dreams and injure

257
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,760
 ourselves or others.

258
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,520
 And that's why you can't move.

259
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,960
 And you could say that you're still dreaming, that's why you're hearing the demonic voices,

260
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,920
 that's why you're seeing these shadow figures, your brains trying to make sense of what's

261
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 going on.

262
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
 Sure, scientific answer.

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,440
 But the fact that your roommate also seems to be affected by what should be a localized,

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,120
 i.e. in your head, event, makes it even more creepy.

265
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,800
 Now yes, the roommate does have a history of talking in her sleep doing weird stuff,

266
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,440
 and it could just be a coincidence.

267
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,640
 But I think when you start to line all these things up, one, the girl claiming that the

268
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 US Naval Academy already makes her feel uneasy.

269
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,480
 She believes that it's haunted.

270
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,120
 Two, her very first sleep paralysis episode, taking place at a facility she believes is

271
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 haunted.

272
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,600
 To someone who's already susceptible to night terrors, to having sleep disturbances, being

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,400
 next to you, you hear a bunch of demon voices, you see a shadow man, you can convince yourself

274
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,960
 that those aren't real, but then when you roll over and you see your friend, maybe not

275
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,400
 friend, maybe just a roommate, maybe they're just acquaintances, acting out in a beastly

276
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,440
 way, laughing in the darkness.

277
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,920
 I would've gotten up and roamed the halls as well.

278
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,560
 Possibly coincidence all these things happen, but maybe it is a piece of evidence to say

279
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,200
 that maybe sleep paralysis isn't decided science.

280
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,080
 Maybe it is something a little more than just our body still being asleep, our mind in a

281
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,000
 state of dreaming while our eyes are open.

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,600
 Maybe it is more metaphysical than that.

283
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,160
 And her roommate wasn't able to fight off the demonic voices as easily as Kimberly

284
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 did.

285
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,480
 And I just realized that both of these women are going to be joining the armed forces if

286
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,040
 they're not already, if they haven't already left the academy, probably not.

287
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,040
 One of them might have been possessed by a demon at the US Naval Academy.

288
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,000
 So there we go, there we go, hopefully it was just a coincidence.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,760
 Hopefully there's not someone who someday is going to be the captain of a battleship

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,720
 and she's like "oh you know it'd be totally awesome.

291
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,760
 Are there nukes on this thing?"

292
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,320
 And her eyes glow red.

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,360
 They're like "no Becca, we've told you for the 15th time there's no nukes on this boat.

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,760
 Oh man, can I get a promotion to the nuke boat?"

295
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,080
 They're like "no, no you can't, your eyes are glowing red, you're super spooky.

296
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,560
 The last time we were at a meeting with generals you got on all fours and started cackling."

297
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,440
 She's like "oh yeah, gotta stop having those meetings at three in the morning."

298
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,800
 And again I guess fates don't want me to do this story right now.

299
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,280
 I don't have enough time to tell the Zodiac Killer one.

300
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,080
 I'm going to tomorrow's episode, I'll do that one first.

301
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,560
 I'll do the Zodiac story first, it's actually really fascinating but every time I get to

302
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
 the point where I have to record it, I was looking at it just now, like I did yesterday,

303
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,520
 I'm like "I don't have enough time to cover this."

304
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,000
 So we're going to do Zodiac Killer tomorrow, but I'm going to pull an audible and we're

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
 going to do another story we have here.

306
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,000
 So Eva Marie brought her Zodiac costume, she cosplays as the Zodiac.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
 She's like "yes, I want this episode, this is going to be awesome.

308
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
 Sorry dude, sorry you don't get to wear your Zodiac.

309
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
 Aw man, she's taking it off.

310
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
 It's fine."

311
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,800
 But it is a good story, we'll have to save it for tomorrow though.

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,640
 So Eva Marie, call in that carbonicopter.

313
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:04,160
 We are leaving behind this battleship, we are headed out to Perth in Australia.

314
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
 Carbonicopter is cutting waves across the beautiful Atlantic Ocean.

315
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
 It's February 4th, 1992.

316
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,960
 Eva Marie landed in this backyard of this dude's house, his name is Andrew, we see a little

317
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,280
 light on in his bedroom and then click, it goes off.

318
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,320
 So we're breaking this house and pulling up a little lock pick, clicky, we're going to

319
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,040
 his house, he's just going to sleep.

320
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,160
 He's having a really hard time falling asleep, he's in bed, he's rolling around, ugh.

321
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
 Shouldn't have listened to that rapid radio, I always have a hard time sleeping.

322
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,800
 He's rolling around in his bed and then all of a sudden he's wide awake.

323
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,160
 And he's standing outside of a basketball stadium that he recognizes, he doesn't know

324
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,120
 exactly where it's at, but when he sees this basketball stadium he knows he's seen it

325
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
 before.

326
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,720
 He's standing outside this basketball stadium and that's when he realizes he's not alone.

327
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,240
 There's 50 other people standing around him, he doesn't recognize any of them, he hears

328
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:21,760
 a voice in his head telling him he's been chosen, a blue orb, appears in the night sky

329
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,480
 above them and begins to descend on this crowd of people.

330
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,960
 As it gets lower it gets bigger and it envelops all 50 people.

331
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,720
 Now they're all standing inside this basketball stadium.

332
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,320
 He says that he's standing in this group and you can only assume if he's getting the

333
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,440
 telepathic message that he's been chosen that they've got a similar message.

334
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
 Chosen for what?

335
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
 Chosen by who?

336
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,040
 Andrew doesn't know any of these questions.

337
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,200
 But he's looking at all the people around him and they feel sinister to him.

338
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,280
 He said they were human, he said they looked completely normal, but when he would look

339
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,480
 at them sometimes they would turn and look directly at him and their eyes were out of

340
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,920
 focus.

341
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,360
 Everything else appeared completely normal but their eyeballs were blurry.

342
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,800
 One of these humans walks over to him holding a cricket bat and kneels before Andrew.

343
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,000
 Andrew offers the cricket bat up to him.

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,920
 Andrew reaches down and grabs the cricket bat.

345
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
 He feels something in his head.

346
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,920
 It's not a telepathic voice, it's a telepathic emotion.

347
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,400
 He begins to become overwhelmed with anger.

348
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,040
 He's holding this cricket bat and he's getting more and more enraged.

349
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:00,080
 He's fighting the urge to act out this anger and then he opens up his hand and the cricket

350
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,200
 bat falls to the stadium floor.

351
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
 He turns and walks out of the arena.

352
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,120
 As he's walking towards the main exit, everything goes white and he's back in his bed.

353
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,480
 This story was from UFO Research Australia, issue number 35.

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,400
 I got it from the great folks over at thinkaboutitdocs.com.

355
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
 This episode could easily be chalked up to a dream.

356
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,240
 Guys having a hard time sleeping, has this dream, all this stuff happens, wakes back

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
 up in bed.

358
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,840
 That's totally a fair skeptical way of reading the story.

359
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,640
 But from a more fun way of reading the story, you have a man who was teleported being chosen,

360
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,000
 being selected, which has come across in a lot of UFO stories.

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,840
 The reason why most of us don't see UFOs is because we're not being selected to view

362
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
 them.

363
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
 Which I find very fascinating.

364
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 You have this man who was chosen, you have this man, you have these other people who

365
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,120
 seem to be also under the control of some of these standard things which I think are interesting

366
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
 and spooky in their own right.

367
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,000
 The eyes being out of focus is something I've never come across before in any of this research.

368
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,400
 And that is really unsettling.

369
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,920
 Because that is the main, I mean I don't want to be cliche and say the eyes are the windows

370
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,680
 to the soul, but that is how we gauge emotion.

371
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,040
 That is how we gauge engagement.

372
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,920
 That is how we gauge all sorts of things.

373
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:35,040
 The eyes are such an essential part to being able to read people's intent.

374
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,000
 Now I'm not saying it's the only thing, you can talk to a girl wearing sunglasses on the

375
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,260
 street.

376
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,480
 You can tell from her body language, from her smile, things like that, how things are

377
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
 going.

378
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,680
 I guess I kind of gave that one away.

379
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,240
 But let's say that I'm not just picking women up on the street.

380
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,240
 Let's say that I'm just talking to them because I love their shoes.

381
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,600
 There's other ways that you can communicate without using their eyes.

382
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:08,760
 But if you saw somebody with blurry eyes, that's such a disturbing image.

383
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,560
 Everything else looks normal, but their eyes are out of focus.

384
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,480
 I've never come across anything like that.

385
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,000
 We've had glowing eyes or no eyes like black eyed children, but the eyes being out of

386
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 focus.

387
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,480
 It makes you think one of two things.

388
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,640
 One that these creatures, whatever they were, if these were other humans who were also chosen,

389
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,560
 maybe he was the only human there.

390
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,880
 Maybe these humans had become enthralled or possessed by these entities.

391
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,360
 And the eyes being blurry was the giveaway.

392
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,280
 Like they couldn't replicate that perfectly enough.

393
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,320
 It could also be a thing that he could see that, but a normal person couldn't.

394
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,440
 Because he was chosen in that element that he was able to read that for a second, kind

395
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,240
 of like that movie they live, which I hate comparing movies to events because that's

396
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,400
 a real easy thing to do.

397
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 But like someone in the right circumstances could actually perceive what these beings really

398
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 were.

399
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,160
 But you and I could talk to someone all day long.

400
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,280
 They look totally normal, but their eyes are actually out of focus.

401
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
 Distorted.

402
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,240
 We don't have that sight.

403
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
 We don't have that instinct.

404
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,600
 That's a really disturbing image.

405
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,280
 I'm trying to think of what that would even look like.

406
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,360
 Because again, I've seen so many versions of that, like the eyes are bloodshot, the eyes

407
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,000
 are white, like just pure white, like a zombie or something like that.

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,680
 But just the eye being out of focus is creepy.

409
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,320
 It's a creepy image.

410
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,440
 And it's one that I haven't come across in stories before.

411
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,960
 Nealing and offering a man a cricket bat as anger enrages him.

412
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,880
 Did they want him to kill the man, Nealing?

413
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,800
 Was it an offering to him to see if they could control him?

414
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,200
 They're showing me bizarre elements and they add up to a very, very interesting story that

415
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
 is incredibly obscure.

416
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,440
 I'd never come across it before.

417
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,240
 But one that may, it may have just been a dream or it may be something that has happened

418
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,960
 before and it may have been something that's happened since.

419
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,080
 Because if he was chosen and he rejected that offer, did they search for the next chosen

420
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
 one?

421
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,040
 Because it's quite possible that this man may have been chosen and they hand him that cricket

422
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,480
 bat and he doesn't have a way to fight off the anger.

423
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:39,440
 He gives in to the mental control and falls under the thumb of this entity.

424
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,520
 And then one night on another part of the globe, a young man or woman is falling asleep.

425
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,760
 They find themselves outside a sports arena in their country.

426
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,840
 And they find themselves standing in a crowd of people with blurry eyes.

427
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,280
 But not a crowd of 50 people.

428
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,000
 This time there's a crowd of 51.

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,600
 A growing army fueled by hate and anger.

430
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:15,760
 And they're looking for their next soldier tonight.
