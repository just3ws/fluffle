1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A series of fictional books written by Harrow and Junkie results in a double homicide.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we take a look at a terrifying story of a plant man.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 It starts off kind of funny, but once you start connecting the dots,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 you realize that no place may be safe from the plant man.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [music]

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 The weather is not warm, but it's sunny.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 The snow is finally melting away like God intended.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 It doesn't look like snow either.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 There's no snow in heaven.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And the reason why hell is on fire is there's no snow down there as well.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Snow is an affront to God and nature.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Snow is evil, but the snowy days have ended all over the globe.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Even Mount Everest is completely dry now.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 It is a beautiful planet that we all love and share.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I actually, I can't wait for global warming myself.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 It means no more snow.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 That's awesome. I'll take that.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So we're going to go ahead and get started here.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 First off though, I wanted to give a quick, very quick channel shout out to this.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 There's a YouTube channel called Marijuana Maintenance.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 This guy has been with Dead Rabbities, been a subscriber to Dead Rabbit Radio before I hit a thousand subs.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So like right now we're hovering about 2,500, 2,600 subs.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So he's been listening to Dead Rabbit for a long time and he actually does his own thing,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 where he also does some weird paranormal videos, but at the same time,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 he's taking fat bong hits and he's talking about the weed that he's smoking.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So he has a little bit of the Dead Rabbit paranormal stuff and then if you're really interested in marijuana,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 he has that too.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I used to smoke and I've had a lot of friends who were really into like the blends of the Indica and what's the other one, Sativa Indica.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 You know, like they were suit, like when you were smoking with them, they could really get into detail about what it was and that's who marijuana maintenance is.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So if you're into, if you're into like the science of marijuana and the blends and all that stuff,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 you give it a shot and he also has some pretty entertaining stuff with paranormal as well.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 So yeah, but I just wanted to go ahead and give a shout out to a guy who's been supporting the channel for a long time.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 So what we're going to talk about first is kind of an interesting story.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Now a long time ago, when I was coming up with the idea of Dead Rabbit Recommends,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 one of the movies that I had that I wanted to talk about was Never Die Alone.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And I thought, I go, you know, because we have a true crime component, I could cover Never Die Alone, just do a little short thing on it.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Never Die Alone is a movie came out in the early 2000s.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 It was directed by Ernest Dickerson, who started off as Spike Lee cinematographer, but then he ended up doing horror movies.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 He's done a lot of stuff, but he directed Demon Knight, which is one of my favorite movies.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And he's directed a bunch of episodes of The Walking Dead.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So you have this black crime drama starting a rapper that's shot like a horror movie.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So right there you have this weird stark contrast.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 There are no protagonists in the movie whatsoever.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 You have basically six characters and they're all working towards their own goals and they all interfere with each other.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And there's no, there's like a main character, but he has to be one of the most reprehensible characters I've seen in mainstream cinema.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So DMX plays this drug dealer named King David, who dies 15 minutes into the movie.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And then the rest of the movie is everyone reacting to his death and all these little plans going awry,

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and his flashbacks to how he basically like he left the city and then came back and got killed and we get to learn what happened after he left it.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So it's a very, it's structured very bizarrely.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And so the B plot is all the characters moving around in the A, and there's really, it's almost not just plots.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 It's almost just like sets of really messed up stuff that King David does.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 All of his flashbacks go like this.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Yo, I met this girl, man. She was really hot.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So I took her home. We banged for a while.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Then she made me mad. So I got her addicted to heroin.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Then I met this other girl and you're like, this is the main character.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 This is the hero of this story. He's constantly destroying people's lives.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Like it's nothing. And then they just move on to the next scene and you're like, what is going on with this movie?

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And it's super, it's very just an intriguing character study.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 None of the characters come off in a good light.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Even the character who's supposed to be sympathetic, who's a white reporter,

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 living the life in the hood and trying to learn the black experience, he just comes off like a total douchebag.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Like he comes off as a total tourist in this area that he flat out doesn't belong in, because he's getting hunted.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It's just a very bizarre movie to watch.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 It's a very bizarre tale and it's filmed very well and it completely flew under the radar.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It didn't do good at the box office.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's one of those gems out there that I think even if you're not into urban crime dramas,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 it really stands out just visually.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It's just, you feel like you're intruding on some really dangerous business when you're watching it.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I don't know if it's the way that it's shot or the script, but you feel like you're basically witnessing a crime when you're watching this movie.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And you're like, oh shit, like, I don't ever want to cross that dude, which is the sign of a good movie, but see, here's the thing.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I was thinking I'll do a quick little three minute thing like I just did on Never Die Alone and that'll be Dead or Abit Recommends.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 I go, I wonder if the guy who wrote, because I knew it was based on a novel.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I go, I wonder if the guy who wrote the novel wrote anything else that was turned into a movie.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Well, no, but his life should have been turned into a movie.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 This is the really weird case of Donald Goins.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Now, Donald Goins was a black dude who was born into a upper middle class, middle class family back in the 30s.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And his family, I believe they lived in Detroit.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 They had like a laundromat, a miniature laundromat empire, so they owned all these laundromats.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 They're very well off.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But Donald just couldn't get through school.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 He was getting picked on, he was getting bullied.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Then he started running with the tougher crowd and his grades were suffering.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So then you can't do this today.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 He forged documents saying he was 18 and joined the Navy and went to the Korean War.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 That's not something you can really get away with nowadays.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But he did.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Back then, they didn't really care.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You just have a piece of paper saying, hey, look, it says on it, I'm 17.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And it's a little stick figure drawing of you as an adult and they're like, you're in.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So he goes over there, does his service, honorably discharged.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 But when he comes back, he has a crippling heroin addiction.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So now this kid starts, and he's a man now, and he was a man when he joined the Navy too,

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 and he began committing petty crimes, larceny, auto theft, stuff like that, just minor stuff.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And he did a little bit of pimping, I believe.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 He ends up getting arrested multiple times.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And so he always wanted to write Western novels, which is a weird thing, I think now.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And that's the stereotype.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 You're like, why would this drug dealer want to write a bunch of Western novels?

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Which, I mean, but then again, that's all that was on television was Western shows.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It wouldn't make sense that even drug dealer would be like, I want to write like Louis Lamore.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 But he ends up writing crime dramas instead.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 He reads ice books by Iceberg Slim, and he goes, I can do that.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I can write books about the real life experiences and the people in my neighborhood that I hang out with.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Because he's no longer living in a fluent neighborhood.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 He's a junkie.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So he writes his first book called "Dope Fiend" about a middle class woman who descends into drugs.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So it's kind of like mirroring his story.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And it's gross.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 People don't want to publish it at first because it's so gritty and realistic.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Publishers are like, now we're not going to do that.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 But finally, a publisher does pick them up and says, tell you what, we'll do it on a contract basis.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Contract basically means you get paid up front, you don't get any of the royalties.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So he writes this book, he gets paid the contract, he then spends that money on heroin.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And then he realizes something.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I'm really good at writing, and I really, really love heroin.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 In the next five years, he pumps out 15 books.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He's spending like three months per novel.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Just *grrrrr*, and they're selling like hotcakes.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He becomes this big author of these type of books.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 No one was writing books like his, and if they were, they weren't getting as successful.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But the people in the neighborhood that he was in were like, yeah, that's really cool.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Donny's getting some money, you know, he's spending on heroin, that's not cool, but...

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 They would read his books too.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And they started to realize something.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 They weren't fictional.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 He was taking stories that he was hearing.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 True crimes and murders and horrible things happening.

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 That either he witnessed or that his friends were telling him about.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Writing them in books.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Selling them.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So you know where this story's going.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He does this thing for five years, he's in this cycle.

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 He writes a book, and then spends all the money on heroin,

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 writes the other books, spends all the money on heroin, writes about...

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And he's going on.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 At this point he has a common law wife, a living girlfriend.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And there's two children there as well.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I wasn't able to tell whether or not they were his kids, because there's not a lot of detail about this.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Most of this stuff, when it happened, it just happened and fell out of the newspaper.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And then there was a bunch of coverage about the life of Donald Goines when "Never Die Alone" came out as the movie.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But, which was actually one of his last books to write.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Which again, when you watch the movie, there's a lot of details that seem really real.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And I'm wondering if that is the book that sparked this off.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But there's not a lot of information about this dude.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Even though I read an article in the New York Times about him,

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and they didn't really have much more information than I found when I pulled up the Wikipedia article.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So, it's October 4th, 1974.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And legend has it that Donald was at his typewriter writing his next novel.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 When a bullet goes through his brain,

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 *Pfft*

156
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Kills him on the spot.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 His living girlfriend must have done something,

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 because then, whoever the murderer or murderers were,

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 followed her into the kitchen.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Either she was running away, or she was in there, and she heard the gunshot and screamed or whatever.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And they executed her in the kitchen.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 The two kids in the house weren't touched, never saw the killer or killers.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 1974, cold case, never been solved, no leads, nothing.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Now, some people say that he might have been killed over a drug debt.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But then you think, killing someone over a drug debt,

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 a person who's currently making money, you're never getting your money.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So, the other theory became, and really, it seems like the cops in 1974 really didn't care.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm sure they did an investigation, but there's just nothing that ever came out of it.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 As far as they're concerned, a black junkie got shot in a bad neighborhood.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And thank God the kids didn't get hurt, let's move on to the next case.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But as time has gone on, people have thought, and even people in the neighborhood at the time thought,

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 "Donnie got shot, 'cause he's talking too much."

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 You can write books and say they're fictional,

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 but if the people that you're writing about know what you're doing,

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 they're going to have a problem with this.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 They're going to come after you.

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It's possible that Donald thought he was untouchable,

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 it's possible that he thought that...

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Well, it's possible he wasn't thinking at all, he just wanted heroin.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 He didn't care how he got it.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Instead of stealing physical items, he was stealing people's stories.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's also possible that the stories were completely fictional,

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 and people just thought they were a little too close to reality.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 But the fact of the matter is, is that Donald died at the age,

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 he was born in 1938, he died in '74, so he was, what is that, like 30-something young man.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He died.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 His mother had him buried with a book.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I don't know which book, it wasn't revealed,

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and I don't think anyone really knows now, because the book was stolen out of his grave.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Was that the book that held the answers to why he was killed?

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Is that the book that had the characters that were based too closely on real-life people that had him killed?

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Did someone just want to be a jerk and not let him have reading material in the afterlife?

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's a bizarre story, and it shows that sometimes when you have the creative people rub up against the wrong people,

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 these things can happen.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 You can be looking for inspiration, but it could be inspiration in all the wrong places.

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So if you ever do watch "Never Die Alone", just remember this movie involving all these horrible people,

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 quite likely in some fashion actually happened.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 The reason why the story structure is just a bunch of little elements,

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 is because those elements are probably based on real life,

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and the movie you're watching may have gotten its writer killed.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Okay, so the next story, this story was really weird for me.

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This next story was really weird for me.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 It's not a crazy conspiracy.

204
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 It started off as, "That's a funny cryptid."

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And then happenstance happened.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The first time I came across the story of the plant man,

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I just kind of stumbled across it, because I'm always looking for weird stuff.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm always looking, obviously, that's why I have this podcast,

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 but I'm always looking for bizarre stuff.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Always clicking around, following links, rabbit hole stuff like that.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And I came across the cryptid with only one confirmed sighting.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So that usually means one of two things.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It's totally made up, and the guy's just pulling a hoax,

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 or he had some sort of mental breakdown or something like that,

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 or it's just the cryptid that we haven't seen.

216
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Now it's usually the first one.

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's almost always when someone's like, "Yeah, I was walking on the street, and a giant banana came after me."

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, whatever dude, it's most likely fake."

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 "As the giant banana is attacking you, you're like, "I still don't believe it."

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 But I came across the plant man one, and I kind of like those one-off cryptids.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 I think it's creepier.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I think running into a cryptid no one else has run into,

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 and the story being true is creepier than running into a Bigfoot.

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Maybe I'm just being a contrarian, maybe Bigfoot is too big.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Bigfoot is so 1963.

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 I want the plant man.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But let's get into the plant man real quick.

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And we're gonna go a couple different places for this, so we're...

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's been a while guys.

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Let's hop in the carboner copter, because we got a lot of traveling to do so.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 [Mimicking the sound of the car]

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Now you notice that the 50 cal machine guns have been replaced with something.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 We have giant containers of Roundup,

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and each of us have to take...

235
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Well, I'm piloting in the helicopter. I don't know what you guys are doing,

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 but you guys better be holding on to a giant thing of Roundup,

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 because we got some spray into...

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 [Laughing]

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Yeah, yeah.

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I don't know if that was racist, or just a bad impression, or both.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 The year is 1968.

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 The place...

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Rivesville, West Virginia.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And we're flying our helicopter over,

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 and moving around the mountains along a trail, we see Jennings Frederick.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Which sounds like the name should be the opposite.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It should be Frederick Jennings, but I checked my notes several times.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's Jennings Frederick.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 He's out there, just hunting, just doing his thing, enjoying nature,

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 trying to ignore the loud helicopter flying overhead,

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and he hears something.

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 [He's talking to himself]

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 He can't make out the words,

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 but he describes it as a voice being played on a fast-forward tape recorder.

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 [He's talking to himself]

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So he can't make out what it's saying, but he hears this voice,

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 and he goes, "It's weird, because I could hear it audibly,

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 but then I also felt like I was hearing it in my head,

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 but I couldn't make sense of it at all."

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He hears it over and over and over again,

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 and then he sees what's making the noise.

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 What he sees is he describes as a plant man.

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He said it was taller than him, with an impossibly skinny body,

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 almost like a reed by a river, just a super skinny body, long skinny arms.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Everything's skinny, everything's skinny.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I don't have to keep describing his skinny toes and all this stuff.

268
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Everything was skinny.

269
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He described him as skeletal, like you could almost just see,

270
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 it was emaciated what he was looking at.

271
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Its eyes were yellow, and it's staring at him.

272
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Now, he also described it as having these long, triangle-like ears.

273
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So they came out of the head and then ended at points at the top,

274
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and the ears were taller than its head.

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And there's pictures, not photographs, unfortunately,

276
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 but there's drawings of what he said that it looked like.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And on the end of its long skinny arms,

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 on the end of its long skinny fron's arms, there are suction cups.

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And he's watching this creature walk towards him.

280
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And now he finally is able to understand what the creature is saying.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 You need not fear me.

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I wish to communicate.

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I come as a friend.

284
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 We know of you all.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I come in peace.

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I wish medical assistance.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I need your help.

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 At that point, he realizes now what it's saying.

289
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 At the point where the creature says, "I need your help."

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 The suction cups open up, and there's needles inside of the suction cups,

291
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 where the hands would be.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It reaches forward, grabs him by the arms, and begins draining blood from Jennings.

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And Jennings described it as impossibly strong.

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He couldn't get away, but he could feel blood being sucked out of him.

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 A short while later, I mean, he didn't sit there for like a half hour and be like,

296
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 "So, come here often."

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 It was a quick suction.

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 The creature lets go, and then according to Jennings,

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 takes strides away from him up to 25 feet.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So his stride, he was basically doing these huge, giant steps.

301
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 He runs over this hill, and at that point, Jennings hears a,

302
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

303
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 "The creature's never been spotted again."

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So was it made up? Was it a one-off cryptid? Was it an alien? Nobody knows.

305
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But this creature was never spotted again.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It wasn't spotted again in the area.

307
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 It wasn't spotted again at all.

308
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And I go, "That's an interesting way to start an episode.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Just a short little story about a cryptid."

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Now, when I was looking for more information on the plant, man,

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I found something that's kind of similar, but maybe a little unrelated, a little funny.

312
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 1966, so two years earlier, in Newport, Oregon,

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 three girls were walking around in the forest,

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 and they see what they describe as three walking tree stumps

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 moving through the forest as well.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 They had no head, no arms, just root-like legs, and they're walking around.

317
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 [imitates walking]

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And they were wearing outfits.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So first off, if I just saw a bunch of tree stumps walking around,

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I'd be like, "Whoa, dude, that's trippy."

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But I would think maybe they were just cryptids or fairies or something like that,

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 but these guys were wearing spandex outfits that were, like, multi-colored.

323
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 They were, like, yellow and orange and pink and blue.

324
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So who knows what to make of that?

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Were they aliens?

326
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Little tree stumps just walking around?

327
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 They hadn't grown properly?

328
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I think you know where I'm going with this.

329
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Or was it just something that girls made up?

330
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But no other additional sightings of those guys, either.

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So I'm thinking, "Ah, that'd be funny if the tree stumps turned into the plant, man."

332
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And I thought, "Well, they're probably just two completely unrelated things

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 in other parts of the world."

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 There's no comparison between the two other than the fact that

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 one looks like a plant and the other one was described as a plant.

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Funny story to put to the beginning of an episode,

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 and then I'll do something about something else.

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 That night, so I read all this stuff, I read all this stuff about Plant Man,

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 and that night I was like, "Okay, got that story set up.

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's all ready to go."

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And I'm fiddling around on my phone and I'm doing more research as I'm in bed.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And I see a link for something called the Sayama City incident.

343
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Sayama City incident.

344
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So let's hop back in the Carbenter Coptor.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We're leaving the little girls in the forest and their tree stumps.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We're leaving Jennings and his bleeding hands.

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 We're not offering any assistance.

348
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We're just observers.

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Let's go to Sayama City in Japan.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 In 1978, so 10 years after the events of the West Virginia Plant Man,

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 there was a father who's up in the mountains of Sayama City.

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 His name is Hadichi Amano.

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Hadichi Amano.

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And he's a ham operator, not like an operator of pork and pork products,

355
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 but he is a radio operator, ham radio operator,

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and the best reception he could get was up in the mountains.

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Anyway, so he's up in the mountains talking to his brother via ham radio

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and just kind of messing around.

359
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 His daughter, his two-year-old daughter, is in the backseat sleeping.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 This is the best place for him to go.

361
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It's a nice little place for him to sleep, whatever.

362
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He's up there.

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And all of a sudden, it's nighttime, by the way, because I should have said that,

364
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 all of a sudden, the whole area is bathed in a bright white light.

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And Hadichi can't figure out where the light's coming from,

366
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 but he's really, really concerning to him.

367
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Also concerning to him, because his ham radio isn't working right now,

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 and it doesn't seem like any of the electronics in his car are working.

369
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Actually, in 1978, did they have a bunch of electronics in cars?

370
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 The ham radio actually definitely wasn't working.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I don't think his GPS was going out of control,

372
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 but so he's sitting there, and he has his daughter in his backseat,

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 with his bright white light coming from somewhere.

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And so he sticks his head out of his car window,

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 and he starts looking around into the night,

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 looking all over into the forest, not seeing anything.

377
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 He looks up, he's not seeing anything in the sky.

378
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He's not seeing our helicopter.

379
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He gets back into the, like, he leans his neck back into the car,

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 and that's when he realizes that the white light is coming from inside the car.

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 He, at that point, turns back to look into the backseat where his daughter is sleeping,

382
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 and she is paralyzed and foaming at the mouth.

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 She's just like, "Ugh!"

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Just like, almost frozen, and foam is coming out of her mouth.

385
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And in that second, once he realizes that and he begins to turn,

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 he notices in the passenger seat is an alien.

387
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But not just any alien.

388
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 This alien looks identical to the plant man.

389
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 The differences were that this one wasn't super skinny.

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 He was bulkier, but he had the same face, the exact same ears,

391
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and he had this weird little metal pipe sticking out of his mouth.

392
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And at that point, no joke, at that point I'm reading the article,

393
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 and Hidecchi says, "It was saying something, but I couldn't understand what.

394
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 It sounded like a tape recorder on Fast Forward."

395
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 As far as I know, no one has ever connected these two events before.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 At all.

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 When I was searching for the plant man, they constantly said it was the only time this was seen.

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 When I was looking at the Sayama city thing, no one ever mentioned the plant man in West Virginia.

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But whatever this creature was, appears to be the same, and we'll get a little more into that.

400
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 But anyways, so Hidecchi is sitting in his car, and that creature, whatever it was,

401
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 presses the metal pipe against his head, and messages were beamed into Hidecchi's head.

402
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And then the creature just disappeared after, again, an indeterminate amount of time.

403
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I don't know how long the blood was being sucked out of Jennings, and they never really say how long this happened.

404
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 There's a period of lost time.

405
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And Hidecchi ended up, the creature left, he ended up driving, the car started working again,

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 he went to a police station, he filed a report, it was kind of like this big thing.

407
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 He kind of became a joke in the area, nobody believed him, and people believed him.

408
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The government was trying to cover it up, or whatever.

409
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 But again, a one-off incident.

410
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Oh, the Sayama city incident, here's this guy, it may be true, it may not, but he saw this alien.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 It's not a gray, it's not what we normally think they look like, it had these weird ears, giant eyeballs, you know, everything was the same.

412
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 This one also had an indentation of a triangle in its head.

413
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So here is my theory.

414
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I'm going to leave the little girl and the tree stumps out of it for right now, but it's still playing with this.

415
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I think it's the same creature.

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I think it's the same creature, and based on the humming and the electrical stuff, it most likely is an alien.

417
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But it's very, one of two scenarios.

418
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 One, that the creature that Hidichi saw at Sayama city was its natural form.

419
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And the one that Jennings ran into actually was injured and sick.

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 That's why it was super emaciated.

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 That's why it was described as skeletal.

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And by drinking human blood, it was able to return to its healthy form.

423
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You could also say that that is simply the life cycle of this plant man.

424
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Just like any plant, they start off just kind of like frail and weak.

425
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And then with the right nutrients, they get strong with strong roots and strong stems and beautiful flowers and all that stuff.

426
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 If you take those two things as true, if both of these people who never met each other 10 years apart made up identical stories involving identical stuff,

427
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 because it's not like the plant man was huge news and they were reading about it in Japan.

428
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I mean, there is a chance that the dude in Japan happened to read an article about a one-off sighting in West Virginia and decided to make up the exact same story.

429
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But if they're making it up, their best bet would be like, "Oh, they were grays and they told me to save the environment.

430
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 They told me that we needed to conserve energy," because that's all the gray aliens say nowadays.

431
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But if we follow the thought line that, and let's say the little girls in here too, these aliens land and they're basically just stumps, they're root systems.

432
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And then they begin to grow into what the plant man, the guy saw in West Virginia, the emaciated, saying, "I need medical assistance,"

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 to its natural, more powerful form, which is what we saw in Sayama City.

434
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 There's only one nutrient that these guys drink in this story.

435
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 There's only one thing, if you follow that thought line, there's only one thing that that alien needed to be strong.

436
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And that was human blood.

437
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Are there plant-like aliens walking around drinking humans' blood to nourish themselves?

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 The idea of aliens drinking blood or using body parts or harvesting humans and stuff like that, that's not a new idea.

439
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 That's been around in the lore for a long time.

440
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But generally, that's what they do on their spaceships.

441
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 They like abduct you or they do it in some sort of clinical laboratory or something like this.

442
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 What the story of the plant man suggests is that you could be out in the middle of the woods and get attacked by one of these things.

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 The story of the plant man in West Virginia really no longer seems like a one-off cryptid.

444
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It actually seems like it's connected to the Sayama City UFO incident.

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And it needed a little bit of human blood to get itself to grow to its normal form.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 At the end of the day, may it turn out that humanity, the greatest life form to ever walk across this planet,

447
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 someday will just become plant food for a race from beyond the stars.
