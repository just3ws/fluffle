1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 A new upgrade to Apple phones has free speech advocates and perverts very very worried.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,260
 Is there any truth to the story that people who suffer from severe dementia return to

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,360
 normal hours before their death?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,000
 Then we take a look at a new conspiracy theory that's making the rounds.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,480
 Is it- after those first two stories are so serious- is it possible that the clowns we

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,000
 all know and love today from Bozo to Ronald McDonald are actually wearing the faces of

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,840
 the half human half demon Nephilim today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:49,040

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
 really appreciate it.

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
 Abysmal I'm gonna go and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robot we are leaving behind

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,120
 Dead Rabbit Command we are headed on out to wherever Apple is headquartered I don't

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
 know where Apple is at.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,320
 Is it in Seattle aren't they all in Seattle we're just gonna row around in the boat for

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,920
 a while I think it's in Seattle but I didn't research that.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,040
 The reason why we're headed to Apple Headquarters is because there's a bit of a controversy

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,160
 right now and I kind of want your guys feedback on this because I have some this intro is

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,640
 very very interesting topic I'd like to see discussion from you guys.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,800
 Apple has recently announced that they're gonna start doing this program.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,040
 Apple who famously when the San Bernardino shooter when that I think it was a couple

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,680
 a man and a woman who just drove into an intersection started shooting people and then it was killed

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,120
 the police wanted access to the shooter's phone and Apple said no that's private information

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,160
 we're not gonna reveal that and the government was constantly trying to subpoena them here's

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,040
 my conspiracy theory with that you want to you want me to drop a conspiracy theory on

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,000
 you I think that was all staged I think that was all staged I think it was staged I think

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,920
 the government either has access to the information that could crack that iPhone like a coconut

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,720
 falling on Gilligan's head or Apple completely cow-towed to him that's my conspiracy theory

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,440
 and I think they made a big show of it so people would constantly go oh Apple's the most secure

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,920
 phone and the government had way to crack it so quickly like I I'm a read in that article

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,880
 and I was like that this is a made-up controversy but for years Apple's like no we're not gonna

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,120
 reveal this information and government's like why you why you bastion of free speech I didn't

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,040
 believe a word of it I believe that either Apple was complicit or that the government

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,520
 had the tools to break into it but anyways that's a conspiracy theory what's going on

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,680
 right now is Apple who does stand for free speech they say they do this is such an interesting

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,120
 complex topic they're going to enact this new feature if you have an iPhone and you

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,520
 upload a photo to the iCloud which can be an automatic process if you don't want to

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,680
 have all these photos on your phone you have to I think you have to switch it on or off

51
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,880
 I believe it might default to off but I'm not an iPhone user if you have photos in the

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,800
 iCloud if they match known child porn photos or child sexual abuse material is the terminology

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,760
 that's being used more commonly now if it matches child sex abuse footage Apple will

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,000
 report you that that's what's being re that's what's being talked about in the media and

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,400
 let's really get into it that's not so much the case what it is is that you're every this

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,480
 is it's actually a little more bizarre than than I just stated so here is here is actually

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,200
 how it's broken down because a lot there is a lot of misinformation about this the idea

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,360
 is you have child sexual abuse material on your phone and it gets uploaded iCloud you

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
 will be reported to the police this is what actually happens there's going to be a series

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,280
 of hashtags assigned to all of known images of child sexual abuse it's going to be like

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,600
 this algorithm that you don't necessarily see and if you have a photo that matches that

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,400
 algorithm a human reviewer will then look at the photo you uploaded to the iCloud and

63
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,200
 after that human reviewer has verified that this is child porn they don't report you

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,680
 to the local police which i think is how a lot of people are saying this they report

65
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,400
 you to the national center for missing and exploited children who they will then report

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
 you to the police so apple gets to say we're not calling the cops on you we're calling

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
 the people who call the cops on you and they say listen our system is so foolproof they've

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,240
 done tests on this they said the chances of you being falsely flagged for this is once

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,960
 a year you have a one in one trillion chance of this accidentally going off and again this

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,800
 is based on known child sexual abuse material so people are like what if i take a photo

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,720
 of you know i'm playing with my kid in the pool am i going to get flagged for that and

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,120
 blah blah blah it's known child sexual abuse material which there's a ton of it out there

73
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,200
 unfortunately in matches it has this algorithm based and then a human has to review it i

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,040
 feel really bad for that human so there's that there's a ton of controversy about this

75
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,240
 you have a bunch of free speech advocates rallying against this not because they're pro child

76
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,040
 porn that's not the case Matthew Green had this really intro he's a cryptos he's a cryptography

77
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,160
 researcher at john hopkins university he had this awesome quote i was reading in this article

78
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,480
 on the ap he said what happens when the chinese government says here is a list of files that

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,440
 we want you to scan for does apple say no i hope they say no but their technology won't

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,640
 say no unquote and that's the slippery slope that i think people are worried about is fine

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,960
 who no one is pro child sex abuse material other than the perverts who produce it and

82
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,920
 use it no one else is and you but you have to look the next step down like what how yeah

83
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,720
 because we know what would happen if china came to them because microsoft has already

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,200
 done it and google's already done it and they've already done all sorts of like changes to their

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,760
 algorithm and change the search engine to kowtow to the chinese government we know that and

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,240
 they do it with the american government as well they're just not as vocal about it that's

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,360
 a very very interesting question my my thing is on the one hand well here this is what's

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,400
 actually so interesting because there's a lot of free speech advocates on about this

89
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,440
 and normal people as well but at the same time don't we all know that our devices are

90
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 spying on us at all time now i just realized that like you can't be a free speech advocate

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,240
 and have a cell phone or smartphone at least you can't it 100 spies on you all the time

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,520
 all the time so now that i'm thinking about it why are we up in arms about this particular

93
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,320
 thing because if i keep talking about ramen noodles near my phone i'll start getting asked

94
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,000
 for ramen noodles like we've given up the free speech that argument doesn't make any

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,440
 sense anymore we've already given up the free speech thing the second the second generation

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 of smartphones when they started started having all these algorithms built into it that makes

97
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,920
 it so much more convenient to get the news we want we've given up the free speech argument

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,720
 so actually i dismiss that now if you're drawn your line of the sand for the free speech

99
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,760
 argument because of this the battle is already over we gave up the free speech argument unless

100
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,600
 you're using like a brick phone and duck duck go or whatever go go duck whatever it is and

101
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,880
 you're using some weird email service you already given up the the privacy argument because

102
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,720
 we have no privacy anymore we've given that away my thing is how do we stop this guys

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,760
 this is an epidemic this child garbage it's out there and it just seems to be getting

104
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,520
 worse every year like you'll see of these raids and they're like we arrested 44 people in

105
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,160
 this thing and it's just like how do else do we stop this now i'm not one of those person

106
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,600
 who wants to keep giving up liberties for a little bit of safety i'm not that guy i don't

107
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,640
 use i don't use an apple phone anyways i think i'm not a fan of magnetize or apple in any

108
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,480
 of that so it's not even my friend but i would be shocked i know i would be shocked if android

109
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,280
 doesn't have something like this already built in and they just never announced it i'm an

110
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,480
 android guy i just how what do we do to stop this because i don't think the answer is nothing

111
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,760
 i don't think the answer is the government coming into my apartment every single day

112
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,560
 and ruffling through my couches and talking to my neighbors and all that stuff either

113
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,240
 like you don't have to have this total police state and i don't think the other answer is

114
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,480
 you don't do anything and let people do whatever they need to do to get off because they're

115
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,040
 a bunch of perverts so what the my question you guys is what do we do how do we stop this

116
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,920
 and i don't know and you know the weirdest thing is to is this is what makes me a little

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,520
 sus of apple in the first place is they announced this and then they announced at the same time

118
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,160
 this protocol for kids like it's on the same site they say kids listen if someone says

119
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,360
 you sends you a nude photo you don't have to look at it we're actually gonna block the

120
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,880
 photo and then we're gonna ask you do you want to look at this nude photo and if you

121
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,520
 want we've actually included this button you can hit and they will send a message to your

122
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,760
 parents saying someone sent you a nude photo okay if you have the technology to block a

123
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,720
 nude photo being sent to a child don't let them click on it they shouldn't be looking

124
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,400
 at it that's that was super weird to me and they put it in the same thing as they were

125
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,920
 talking about this they're allowing their they are acknowledging they will allow your

126
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,840
 children to look at nude photos if they want nude i'm not talking about a biology exam

127
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,920
 a textbook picture from a textbook i'm not done these are images that people send them

128
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,440
 via the messaging is very very specific if someone messes you a photo and the algorithm

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,080
 picks up that it is a naked person it lets the child know it's okay if you don't want

130
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,160
 to look at this naked person but if you do this is a sensitive picture you can click

131
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,200
 here don't let them look at it if you have the technology to block a child from looking

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,480
 at this stuff in the first place block it and say we cannot send this message this user

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
 is under the age of 18 and then you go look the kid can easily just lie and say they're

134
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,000
 over 18 sure but but it's so bizarre they kind of like are like by the way we're gonna

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,480
 let your kids get nudes and send nudes if you go to send a new to goes you know maybe

136
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,360
 you don't want to send this but it still allows them to send it i didn't know that iphones

137
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,720
 could tell how old the person was using them you should just shouldn't be able to send

138
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,360
 if you can tell that it's a nude photo don't let them say absolutely bizarre so in the

139
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,480
 same part where they're talking about this is the way we're gonna stop child porn from

140
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,040
 being out there in the same page they go listen this is the way your children can produce

141
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,840
 child porn more safely we're gonna say are you sure you want to send this nude absolutely

142
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,280
 bizarre weird just stop it if you guys can stop it stop it that that segment went on

143
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,880
 a little bit longer than i had planned so we're gonna skip the story about the dementia

144
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,680
 patients it's a weird one we're gonna save that one for tomorrow let's go ahead and move

145
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,800
 on to our last story abysmal i'm gonna go ahead and toss you the key so that world famous

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,480
 carpenter copter go ahead and take us up and out of this apple headquarters building as

147
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,320
 they're getting raided by the police we are headed on out to biblical times that's a

148
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:59,880
 location you didn't know that i did a story a long time ago it's one of my favorite episodes

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,000
 i know a lot of you guys love it too about the book of giants it's the apocryphal story

150
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,440
 about what happened when angels and humans enter bread and it's supposedly a lost book

151
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,160
 the bible it's really really interesting episode i'll put it in the show notes and just a quick

152
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,240
 overview of what the nephilim is it is that it's that they're mentioned briefly in the

153
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,080
 bible and then there have been other books like the book of inoc and like the book of

154
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,680
 giants that goes into more detail but what it is is i think they're originally mentioned

155
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,360
 in genesis angels came down to earth god sent them down there to kind of be the stewards

156
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,400
 of men but then they found out how bootylicious our women were started banging them their

157
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,160
 children became these great heroes these great legends of old that's what we see in the book

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:54,320
 of genesis but what we see in the book of giants it kind of goes on from there it's that these

159
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,560
 angels kept interbreeding with humans and it was polluting the genetic bloodstream of

160
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,640
 what humans were because you started having these super humans for lack of a better word

161
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,400
 some of them were giants some of them just had giant personalities they're really cool

162
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:13,720
 to be around some of them had superpowers and so god was like okay this is what i thought

163
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,640
 this is what i thought when i created adam and eve so we got to go down and take these

164
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,800
 out and there was a great angelic army actually i think it was just four dudes but they pretty

165
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,760
 much wiped out all of these nephilim and their angel fathers and even the human mothers

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:35,320
 and to finally put the nail in the coffin of this half breed human race god flooded the planet

167
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,960
 so it's an interesting story i love doing that episode it's always very fascinating i get a lot

168
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,040
 of requests to cover it even more so it's a very interesting story whether or not it's true

169
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,920
 because it's not in the bible it's kind of an apocryphal book but even dismissing all of that

170
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,120
 the nephilim are mentioned in the bible ever so briefly as these people who are half human

171
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,160
 half angel there's this new conspiracy theory coming out and when i first read about it and

172
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,360
 i'm sure when you guys saw the title of this episode you kind of chuckled and it's an interesting

173
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,000
 journey let's let's hold judgment on this real quick there's been about three different youtubers

174
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,200
 over the course of five years who have made this same point with different intentions but this is

175
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:29,640
 in a nutshell the nephilim the half human half angel offspring looked like clowns looked like what we

176
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 would consider a modern day clown they had red hair that sometimes came up in a point like a

177
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,160
 jester's cap they had a bright red nose and they had white skin and the logic behind this

178
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,000
 i mean it's kind of hard word to use of this and the logic behind this is they take two cases of

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,120
 known giants in history and point out that they have these features as well we've covered both of

180
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,640
 these one of them was the giant of kandahar he was a giant who supposedly came out of a cave

181
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:07,160
 in kandahar afghanistan and fought a bunch of us special forces he was pale faced or he was white

182
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,080
 and he had red hair and he came out the spear i did an episode on him and i if i remember correctly

183
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,360
 i disputed i said that probably didn't happen if i remember correctly the second story they point

184
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,760
 out i also covered on this show and it did happen we do have proof of this the question is what do

185
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,800
 you consider a giant i think when we think of giants we're thinking at least when i think of

186
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,240
 giants i'm not thinking of shack or lebron james or something like that like to me they're super

187
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,360
 tall dudes when i think of like god level giants like the offspring of like humans and angels i'm

188
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,760
 thinking like 13 feet or taller but anyways we covered this it was a group of giants in nevada

189
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,080
 they were cannibals they were eating other natives in the area and all these tribes had to get

190
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,440
 together to kill them and that was a really cool episode i did these giants this is like old timing

191
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,600
 nevada before any westerners got here they were described as having red hair and pale skin

192
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,160
 so this idea that we have now two stories of giants one of them is easily dismissed the giant

193
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,360
 of kandahar but the giants of nevada there is some archaeological evidence to show that they were

194
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,840
 taller than normal if i remember correctly taller than normal people but still would put them around

195
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,640
 like six foot two again it's been a while since i did that episode but i could be off on that but

196
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,520
 the point is is that we have those stories that are kind of tied into the white skin red hair

197
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,720
 and in locations where you wouldn't expect those genetic traits you want to expect to see a pale

198
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,680
 person with red hair in the middle of nevada long before any europeans settled there also i had to

199
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,160
 look this up because i didn't believe it but on easter island there are statues that have red

200
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,920
 caps you know those giant statues on easter island of the dude's heads some of them have red caps so

201
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,800
 they've been brought into this conspiracy theory as well that those were images of these great giants

202
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,280
 that once walked the world so that's the first piece of evidence that we see put out by these

203
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:11,000
 youtubers the second piece of evidence is this is so because when i when i saw this first youtube

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,040
 video i had a chuckle i just saw the title was so interesting let's get in so i saw a recent video

205
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,920
 from a channel called conspiracy are us and they were doing this topic about clowns look like the

206
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,560
 nephaline i was looking through their channel and it was a very entertaining and very educational

207
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,920
 video they do a lot of mudflod stuff which i did an episode on the mudflod i think that's been

208
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,080
 settled i think we know what was caused there it was cities were being raised because we needed to

209
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,360
 make room for our sewage lines cities had existed for thousands or hundreds of years with open

210
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,800
 sewage and all of a sudden there's a population boom so we raised the city or simply raised the

211
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,080
 roads and we just kept like first floors then became basements so we could put sewage lines

212
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,040
 underneath the streets i think that's pretty settled at this point but the mudflod still is a very

213
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,000
 popular conspiracy theory and i'm not he can definitely investigate that i'm not the guy who

214
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,160
 tells people what to do but conspiracy rs did this video about clowns look like nephaline they got it

215
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,440
 from understanding conspiracy a youtube channel called understanding conspiracy theory they started

216
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:24,280
 out in 2017 they no longer put out new videos they put out those 17 episodes all saying the same thing

217
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,200
 the nephaline looked like clowns and it's just kind of the same thing over and over again again

218
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,960
 it's fairly well put together a youtube channel i didn't listen to all of their stuff but it he

219
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,960
 does his research it's an observational conspiracy theory they're looking at stuff like why do these

220
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,360
 giants have red hair and white faces and what does that look like that looks like clowns what's

221
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,280
 interesting though is understanding conspiracy didn't originate this they're the most prolific

222
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,920
 and conspiracy rs admits hey i found this on the understanding conspiracy channel

223
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,640
 understanding conspiracy gets very upset that this was actually originally brought up on youtube

224
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,280
 there could be an article floating around there somewhere but the earliest example i could find

225
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,680
 on youtube there's a website called the epic conspiracy and they put out a video in 2015

226
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,640
 called new evidence the nephaline are interdimensional killer clowns and it was a joke video they're

227
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,160
 just kind of joking around and making these observations their other videos seem to be the

228
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,560
 same thing i don't think they're putting out anything else either but so you have these youtube

229
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,600
 channels mostly understanding conspiracy putting out this stuff and when you look at that when you

230
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,120
 go okay so we have giants that i guess that's clown like white faces red hair but then the

231
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,480
 conspiracy and so when i saw that again i was like oh it's kind of interesting but it's an

232
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,040
 observational conspiracy theory the world's full of them then we go into a little bit deeper and

233
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,520
 again i'm getting all this information from conspiracies rs and understanding conspiracy

234
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:03,640
 they go into the fact that dmt users when people use the drug dmt it's mostly no people go you

235
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,960
 take it and you see the mechanical elves you see like past reality i've never done dmt it doesn't

236
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,280
 really interest me but people talk about the mechanical elves and and that seems to be a

237
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,120
 weird thing that when you do the drug to me that's that is bizarre like if i'm smoking weed i'm

238
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,720
 usually having a different experience than anyone else around me and a different experience than

239
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,080
 everyone else who's ever smoked weed when drugs like dmt when they go you see the mechanical elves

240
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,440
 like people who've done it over their decades they keep seeing the same thing that's weird to me

241
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,360
 it makes me think that dmt is tapping into something and i've always heard about the

242
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,560
 mechanical elves i think i first heard about it from alex jones but another thing dmt users

243
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:49,080
 often see are clowns that's a that is a regular thing they see clowns they see gestures they

244
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,480
 see jokers and all these dmt trips a lot of times it's reported they go to a dimension

245
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:04,520
 that's nothing but a giant circus or an endless carnival that that doesn't that doesn't make

246
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,080
 me want to do dmt like the mechanical elves whatever but dude could you imagine like winning

247
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,440
 prizes in an alternate universe that'd be dope you're like throwing balls and like you're winning

248
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,120
 these eight-dimensional teddy bears you do dmt a lot of times they go to these universes that's just

249
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,760
 the giant circus or a giant carnival sometimes a casino as well you win some money in another

250
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,480
 universe that'd be dope i wonder what the exchange rate is like but they're seeing these clowns and

251
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,600
 the question that's put forth by these youtube channels is so now we have not only do we have

252
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,840
 giants having attributes that are similar to clowns but people who do dmt are seeing clowns and i

253
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,240
 came across this article in my research by sam wolf called why do gestures and tricksters appear in

254
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:58,680
 the dmt experience it's this long article so long and the answer who knows sam wolf because i don't

255
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:06,760
 know i think it might be some sort of yungi and archetype but i don't know who knows he goes on

256
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,280
 and on and on he says yeah it archetype it might be here to teach us lessons like the gesture of

257
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,360
 like the native americans and then it just goes on and on but the answer is he does not know he does

258
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,120
 have this quote when he's talking about his best answer is a yungi and archetype quote but it may

259
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:29,560
 not resolve the mystery of why dmt as a as a specific substance has a propensity to bring

260
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,960
 these entities to the surface unquote so yeah why are they seeing if it is an archetype fine but

261
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,240
 why is it dmt that does this and why does it keep bringing people back to the circus back to these

262
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,320
 carnivals and why is it full of clowns and it does it it does make you think because there it's so

263
00:22:51,320 --> 00:23:00,280
 funny we know who created the modern clown clown is actually a character from a play or a performance

264
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:06,120
 called the harlequin aid and there was a character named harlequin there was a character named clown

265
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,440
 there was a character named columbine which i'm honestly surprised there's no conspiracy theories

266
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,880
 about that like it's all a performance and if you knew there was only four characters and they were

267
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,160
 no no no i'm surprised there's nothing like that but um columbine there's a character named columbine

268
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,200
 there's a character named pantaloon but back in the 1860s there was a guy this very very famous

269
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,640
 performance this harlequin show was very famous there was a guy named joseph grimaldi and he was

270
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,480
 got the role of the clown he'd been clowning since he was a kid and he did the white makeup the red

271
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,800
 nose the red hair like the face design he created that before 1861 i don't know people were just

272
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,200
 walking around there like hey everyone i'm a clown he was the one who put on all this makeup

273
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,800
 he took clowning so seriously he was a famous clown he basically was the johnny noxville of

274
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:05,240
 clowning he clowned so much i love this quote from this newspaper called the times back in the 1860s

275
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,040
 quote grimaldi is the most assidious of all imaginal buffoons and it is absolutely surprising

276
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:19,560
 that any human head or hide can resist the rough trials he volunteers serious tumbles from serious

277
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,960
 heights innumerable kicks and incessant beatings come on him as matters of common occurrence and

278
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,080
 leave him every night fresh and free for the next night's flagellation unquote it really didn't

279
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,120
 mean to the story i just like the idea of this guy getting beat up so much he couldn't be a clown

280
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,520
 anymore he did end up retiring but on the one hand we do know who invented the clown makeup but on the

281
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:52,920
 other hand why do clowns speak to us so much like we we can figure out joseph grimaldi invented the

282
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:59,000
 makeup but why do clowns terrify people so much some people say it's a relatively new thing

283
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,280
 and it didn't exist say before john Wayne gasey or before pennywise the clown

284
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,680
 but it's such an intrinsic fear in people like i remember once i heard a long time ago that

285
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:19,480
 people the the clown the idea of the clown makeup came from people who would run out during gladiator

286
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,800
 games and drag the bodies off and they wore this garish makeup and they were like the souls of

287
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,760
 the dead claiming the brutally slaughtered people who just been eaten by lions or stabbed i go

288
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,360
 and i'm not reading that and i go maybe it turned out to be true but the idea was like maybe maybe

289
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,240
 that's why people associate the clown face with terror because there's a good there's a good

290
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,040
 segment of society who are afraid of clowns and i i don't think it's proportionate like people who

291
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,680
 are afraid of ghosts like in general or people who are afraid of of sharks in general that's fine

292
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,600
 but the clowns is such a specific phenomenon and people are terrified by it terrified by the clown

293
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,720
 so it always makes me think that yeah we know joseph grimaldi invented the clown but does

294
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,600
 is the clown tap into something deeper and darker in the human psyche

295
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,200
 because people are afraid of it the same way they're afraid of a shark that can actually kill you

296
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,760
 or a dog people have fear dies so it's fascinating so this is one of those conspiracy theories that

297
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:30,600
 i came across i kind of chuckled i was expecting a haun's level take on this stuff but um i'm a

298
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:38,280
 bit i i'm not gonna say i believe in it but i'm a fan of it i honestly am i think it would explain

299
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:46,280
 i think the fact that the clown did i i'll give him this i think i honestly do i think the clown

300
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,720
 interacted with us at some point in human history and i'm not talking about the jester spirits

301
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,920
 because we see those all across cultures i'm talking about something with the white skin and the red

302
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:05,000
 hair and the the red just the disproportion body types the ultra colored clothes i'll even go that far

303
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,200
 i think something in our past very clown like interacted with humanity and we still have a

304
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:21,080
 natural fear of them i'm personally not scared of clowns i i'm not scared of clowns but i

305
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:28,040
 understand why people are and i think it i think when people are afraid of clowns it's not like

306
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,240
 the same way i'm afraid of samara from the ring i know samara from the ring is completely fictional

307
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,960
 the movie really really scared me and i'll have nightmares about it occasionally but i understand

308
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,840
 that that i think it that's just me being scared of ghosts in general people who are afraid of

309
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,920
 clowns they have the same fear the same way that people who got bit by a dog or snapped at by a dog

310
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,120
 when they are a kid or watch the dog attack someone has a fear of a dog it's based on something real

311
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:01,320
 or even just the teeth because our evolutionary brain says gnashing teeth are bad those are fangs

312
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,960
 stay away but their brain is misfiring and they're not just saying stay away from a mean dog they're

313
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,680
 staying away from all dogs they have a phobia of dogs i think that's something clown like interacted

314
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,800
 with us i think on a previous episode i said it might have been an alien i think it's that level i

315
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:23,160
 think something interacted with us and people have still in the evolutionary brain stay away

316
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:31,480
 from something that looks like this so why not the nephilim could that be i mean the the disproportion

317
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,280
 body would make sense because again if you're half human and half angel you're not probably going to

318
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:43,240
 look like a normal person so the the the body the big body the giant i'm actually i'm gonna go to

319
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,640
 each detail and i'm gonna be like if you walk into a nephilim and honk their nose it goes

320
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,320
 but you know i mean i'm not gonna say they had to have big feet and like

321
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,080
 giant car it's like yes just like the nephilim but i think like there probably was something

322
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,720
 sinister in our past that looked like a clown pale face red hair

323
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,560
 it's not the irish it's not the irish do you know what i mean it's not i'm not gonna hang my hat

324
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,600
 on this conspiracy theory but i actually it makes sense to me whether it's the nephilim or it was

325
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,640
 some sort of interdimensional spirit or it was some sort of alien lifeformer who knows but i

326
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,840
 i am a fan of the belief that something evil appeared as a clown or clowns in the past and

327
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,120
 humans still have an evolutionary memory of them and some people love them some people love them

328
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,120
 some people still think clowns are hilarious and they invite them to their parties and

329
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,000
 everything like that and they're like oh joseph grimaldi that's the best invention your face and

330
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,320
 they still love clowns and maybe that's also tied into the evolutionary system as well maybe if you

331
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,840
 go back in time they're great great great great great great great grandma was getting banged

332
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,080
 by a nephilim what if it turns out that's the case if you love clowns you have your

333
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,560
 your part angel if you can't get enough of clowns you actually are a descendant of the nephilim

334
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,920
 your genetic line lived through the flood and if you hate clowns you're just a boring you're just

335
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:25,560
 a boring old human very very interesting conspiracy theory it starts off very goofy

336
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,600
 and it kind of makes you think an interesting conspiracy theory and one that should send

337
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,920
 chills down the back of any clown hater it may turn out that your aversion towards clowning around

338
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:43,000
 may not simply be some weird hang-up you have it may actually be an early warning system

339
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,320
 you may be trying to tell the rest of humanity these things are evil but no one will listen to you

340
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,520
 no one will listen to you until it's too late and the world has the world has been taken over

341
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,080
 clown faces are marching through the streets you're hiding in your bedroom but it doesn't stop you see

342
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,320
 you see two two big old shoes standing outside your bedroom door you run in your closet you're

343
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,520
 hiding you're sweating you're sweating as much as jason has recorded this podcast and you hear

344
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:20,040
 a meow meow meow as the clown gets closer you're like jason they're just making clown you don't

345
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,240
 do they look like clowns or are they clowns like now you're getting confused the point is is that

346
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,720
 you you who are afraid of clowns who shut this podcast off a half hour ago the closet door opens

347
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,520
 and then you see a big old hand come in and grab you and the next thing you know you have like a

348
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,880
 drill you have a drill in your hand i was gonna say you got a drill going through your head but no

349
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,320
 you have a drill in your hand you're helping them build the clown headquarters and because you're

350
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,000
 real handy and then after you get done doing that they're like you did a really good job dude

351
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,960
 and then they take the drill from you put a hole in your head and they give you lobotomy and now

352
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,120
 you're just a clown soldier walking through the streets of your former town there's like balloons

353
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,760
 everywhere like jason are they clowns or do they look like clowns there's balloons everywhere

354
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,240
 and every day is a new child's party but all the children will lobotomize if you're not one of

355
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:16,440
 the nephaleme if you're not one of their clown loyalists you just sit there all day long uh

356
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,880
 we just sit there in captivity all day long brain dead pale white face red hair glued on to you

357
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:32,840
 all patchy and stuff you're like jason i don't care what i'm like i have a lobotomy i'm not like

358
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,560
 oh no look at my clothes these are so unfashionable oh my hair oh i'm having a bad hair day i have a

359
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,160
 hole drilled in my brain all humanity has holes drilled in their brain apparently i'm no more

360
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:52,200
 oh no i got mustard on my shirt i'm brain dead you're right but anyways the clowns have now taken

361
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,800
 over the planet and then they look up into the night sky and they go what else is out there

362
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:07,080
 and then they build a huge clown they build one spaceship one tiny spaceship and every clown

363
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,520
 gets on board and they take off to go invade another planet and you're just sitting there

364
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:21,720
 and then actually there is no end everyone on the planet has a lobotomy it's there's that's the end

365
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,280
 the end
