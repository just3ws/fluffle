1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 A simple and fun AI art program is taking the internet by storm.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,320
 But is it being controlled by forces from beyond?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,700
 Then we wrap up Season 18 by taking a look at a story of a young man who gets in a terrible

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,280
 car accident.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:27,640
 While he is immobilized in a local ICU, he is warned that any movement could end his life.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,680
 Until does he know he is about to move at the speed of light?

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Break.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:01:03,180
 I will also continue to put out my daily 1 minute true crime segments on TikTok and

9
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,180
 YouTube and Instagram.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:11,480
 I am always afraid I am going to burn out on the podcast so I gotta take these 2 week

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 breaks.

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,240
 I just sit and watch movies and play video games and it is fantastic.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,160
 And let's go ahead and introduce our pilot for today.

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,960
 Normally we highlight the people who donate money to Patreon, donate money to Livestream

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
 but I always say it's okay if you just get the word out about the show and I want to

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,480
 highlight one of those people today.

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:57,980
 And before we get started let's take a look at our submission for Fan Art Friday.

18
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,320
 This is from longtime listener, longtime supporter of the show.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,520
 KakiCube posted this.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,160
 You see this awesome mosaic.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
 We have a variation on the Dead Rabbit Radio logo.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,320
 UFO flying around with a haunchy veil or bust banner.

23
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 Mormon Bigfoot.

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,680
 We see Sam, the sand down clown there as well.

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
 Fan, fantastic art.

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,240
 Thank you so much for sending it over and what an awesome piece of art to have for the end

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
 of season 18.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,220
 Angela Yoshi, let's go ahead and talk to the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,020
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,620
 We're driving all the way out to the University of Texas at Austin.

31
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,300
 We're going to University of Texas at Austin not for like a football thing like the Long

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,060
 Horns or whoever plays there, the Saddle Riders or something like that.

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,220
 We're not going to see the games.

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,260
 So if you guys brought your peanuts and your Cracker Jacks, we don't get to watch any games.

35
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,140
 We're actually going to go hang out where the nerds hang out.

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,520
 So we're going to walk past all the hot cheerleaders.

37
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
 We're going to walk past all the buff football players.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,720
 We're going to walk and they're laughing at us as we're walking there.

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 They're like nerds, nerds, nerds.

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,080
 They're like, oh, we're just hanging out with nerds.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
 That doesn't make us nerds.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,560
 That's exactly what makes you a nerd is you hang out with them.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 He's right.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
 We're going to go and check out the office of Guionis Doris.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 Guionis?

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,880
 Doris maybe?

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,760
 He is a computer science PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin and he's

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,180
 currently working with Alex Demakis.

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
 He's a professor.

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,940
 And the reason why we're here is they are researchers in the machine learning and information theory

51
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,820
 department of University of Texas at Austin.

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:45,500
 When they figured out, recently, Guionis posted this Twitter feed about this program.

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,100
 No one is Dolly too.

54
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,980
 Now I have to admit Dolly has taken over my Discord.

55
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,240
 My Patreon Discord basically no one talks about stuff anymore.

56
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,560
 They just all post in an area where people are posting their Dolly artwork.

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 It's awesome.

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
 If you guys don't know what it is, there is a version of this, a consumer level version

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
 of this called Dolly Mini.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,520
 I'll put it in the show notes.

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,880
 But you'll type in stuff like a velociraptor attacking Sailor Moon and it'll create nine

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,920
 AI generated images of that.

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 It's super bizarre.

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,860
 I mean, there's so many great examples out there.

65
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,360
 People have been having a lot of fun with this.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,820
 The artwork is really, really cool.

67
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:32,640
 And you can even say like Eminem fighting a Eminem in the style of a medieval cross-stitching

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,420
 and it'll create that.

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,120
 It's fascinating and it's a lot of fun.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,860
 But there's a more advanced version of this called Dolly too.

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,540
 And that's what they're using here at UTA.

72
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,500
 Is that an appropriate abbreviation?

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,340
 And you put in that prompt.

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,280
 Now I remember once I tried putting in Anya Taylor Joy fights Britney Spears and it didn't

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
 do that.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,840
 It just created like a picture of a Anya Taylor Joy-esque figure and then a Britney Spears-esque

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
 figure.

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,120
 It didn't actually have them throwing punches and I realized, oh, this is a safeguard.

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,560
 So you couldn't put like Kate Beckinsale having sex with me and it would create all

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,800
 these pornographic images.

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,740
 And you use real people's names, there's safeguards built into it.

82
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,140
 Because otherwise people would have been using it for porn immediately.

83
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,140
 And I did say fighting.

84
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,660
 I didn't say another word.

85
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,460
 I actually wanted to see them like boxing in a ring for my love.

86
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,540
 But what Guionis has discovered, I think I've pronounced his name three different ways so

87
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
 far.

88
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,420
 What Guionis and his team have discovered that there is a hidden language within Dolly

89
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,840
 too.

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,740
 These are actual examples they used.

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,480
 If you type in "two farmers talking about vegetables with subtitles."

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,660
 That's what they fed into the AI.

93
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:03,120
 It shows two very photorealistic farmers and one of them is holding cabbage.

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,760
 But there's like a thought bubble or a speech bubble, like a comic strip speech bubble coming

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,500
 out of one of the farmers and it's filled with gibberish.

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,300
 It doesn't say hey how your vegetable is doing.

97
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,780
 The headline of the picture says "Vavo Pintinguus Victus" and then one of the farmers is saying

98
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,660
 in the speech bubble "App Poplo Vesmitarius."

99
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,540
 If you take that word Victus and just take that word and enter it into this Dolly too

100
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,640
 program, it will show pictures of vegetables.

101
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,460
 If you take the Apollo Veritasio, or however you pronounce it because it's a made up word,

102
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,900
 it will show pictures of birds.

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,700
 So what the AI was saying in its own language that it remembers, right?

104
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,380
 Because originally just threw up this gobbly gook but then when you take that gobbly gook

105
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,180
 out and you enter it in, it will show what the farmers were talking about.

106
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,300
 Birds were eating their crops.

107
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,400
 People on Twitter started freaking out about this and they're like "well you know false

108
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,120
 positives and da da da da da da."

109
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,240
 And Giannis said "here's the thing, does it happen 10 out of 10 times?"

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
 No.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,440
 Sometimes it only happens 9 out of 10 times.

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
 It's not always exact.

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,360
 But he goes "it shouldn't be happening at all."

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,520
 He goes "even if it only happened 2 or 3 times out of 10, it shouldn't be happening

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
 at all.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,600
 If the AI is spitting out gibberish, that's fine because in a sense the images are gibberish,

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,320
 the language can be gibberish.

118
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,660
 But if you then take that language and you input it 10 times and 9 out of 10 times it

119
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,580
 shows pictures of birds when you type in the gobbly gook that one of the farmers was saying,

120
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,580
 he goes "it shouldn't do it at all."

121
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:54,100
 There is something running in this AI that is creating its own language.

122
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
 They did another one.

123
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,500
 They put in quote "2 whales talking about food with subtitles."

124
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,000
 The AI created a picture of two cartoon whales and one of them was saying "watcha zode a

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
 hawke's ria."

126
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,040
 And when they take that gibberish and put it into the AI to see what that prompt means,

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,240
 it's pictures...

128
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,760
 This is really interesting because it's the two whales talking.

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,680
 When you put that phrase in it shows pictures of fish meals.

130
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
 So it's not just pictures of fish.

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
 It's pictures of fish on a plate.

132
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,220
 Like servings of fish for a human.

133
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,060
 It was specifically saying fish meals.

134
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,380
 Not fish.

135
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,500
 Fish meals.

136
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,860
 Now some people like I said are pushing back against this.

137
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,100
 They're saying false positives.

138
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,220
 People got really upset about this.

139
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,980
 This is what I find just so interesting.

140
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
 It's actually not quite interesting.

141
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,140
 I find it quite tedious.

142
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,420
 It's one thing to be a skeptic and it's one thing to be a knee jerk skeptic and be like

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
 "no that's impossible.

144
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
 Here's why."

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,480
 And then you point it out so if you typed in apoplo, that's some of the terrorists you

146
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 got.

147
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
 Birds.

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 One person pointed out well apopoly is similar to apidea which is the Latin term for a specific

149
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
 family of birds.

150
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,080
 Well yeah sure you got us there.

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,120
 I'm sure there's but it showed all types of birds.

152
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,880
 It wasn't just this particular species.

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,900
 So you would have some crossover.

154
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,520
 But to even say that, to even be like well you know it doesn't have its own language.

155
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,860
 It actually just speaks Latin.

156
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,580
 That's still weird.

157
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,860
 That's still super bizarre.

158
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,700
 So there is this pushback to it.

159
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,540
 It's interesting nonetheless but what I also found super interesting, I was recently watching

160
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,260
 I'll put this in the show notes as well.

161
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,620
 I was watching an AI program that was composing music.

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,300
 Like this guy created this music and then he wanted the AI to finish it and it became

163
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
 this hellish music.

164
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,820
 Basically it was people screaming.

165
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,520
 I can't play you into the sound clips for copyright reasons.

166
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,240
 But I'll put it in the show notes.

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,320
 And in the comments for that video someone said they had heard a conspiracy theory about

168
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
 the AI.

169
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 Just AI in general.

170
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,000
 And this is going into the intro.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Darker force behind the AI.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
 There's a conspiracy theory apparently going around.

173
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,440
 I hadn't heard of this until I saw it on this YouTube comment.

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,180
 That demons have infiltrated the AI.

175
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,860
 That demons are using this code to interact with humans.

176
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,220
 And that's why it seems like it's advancing so quickly.

177
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,420
 That's why it seems like you can have a conversation with this stuff.

178
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,780
 There was a guy recently at Google who got fired because he said like his conversation

179
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,580
 program became self aware.

180
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,580
 And they fired him.

181
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,460
 They fired him because he disclosed stuff.

182
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
 They were working on this stuff.

183
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,940
 It was an NDA and he was talking about it.

184
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
 So they fired him.

185
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,640
 I don't think that it's actually self aware.

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
 I mean I could be wrong.

187
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,560
 The AI could be hunting me down right now for even talking about it.

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
 Roku's Basilic and all that.

189
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,040
 But there's this idea that the reason why AI is advancing so quickly is because demons

190
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,960
 have now infiltrated the code.

191
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,480
 That when you're talking to these things, when you're inputting these prompts into a computer,

192
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,480
 the reason why it works so well is because it's under demonic influence.

193
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,980
 Everything behind the ones and the zeros are creatures that have existed since before time

194
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
 began.

195
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
 I like that theory.

196
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,420
 I just found that theory today.

197
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,980
 I haven't had a lot of time to dig into it.

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
 But I find it super interesting.

199
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,460
 Really you have a belief that's existed since the Stone Age.

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,220
 Interacting with modern day technology.

201
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,640
 Cutting edge technology really.

202
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,420
 What if this language that we're looking at is not just gibberish spit out by an AI as

203
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,660
 it's trying to learn how to communicate?

204
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,400
 It's actually the language of the demons.

205
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,280
 It's actually the language of the damned.

206
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,080
 Fascinating story when conspiracy theories and real world science and science fiction

207
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,520
 all collide together.

208
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
 What a crazy story.

209
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
 I mean even without the demons it's really cool.

210
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,040
 I'll put a bunch of links on the show notes.

211
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
 You can take a look at all that stuff.

212
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,600
 That AI song is weird.

213
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,220
 Tonya Taylor Joy and Britney Spears Your Fight Over Me will come someday but not even the

214
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
 AI will allow it today.

215
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,260
 That was one thing they were saying was that it's possible in theory to bypass the filters

216
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,900
 that have been set up by putting in this gibberish.

217
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,020
 There may be a way to break into the AI and start producing content that it shouldn't

218
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
 produce.

219
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,940
 If you know the gibberish code you could use it to produce porn.

220
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,680
 To be honest I didn't specifically say porn but I think that's coming down the pipe.

221
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,680
 I really do with that with deepfakes and all sorts of stuff and this AI that can generate

222
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,400
 any image and it's getting the picture quality is getting better and better.

223
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,160
 Even if you put safeguards saying you can't put in these particular acts if you know the

224
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 AI's language for those acts you can put those in because the filter you can't filter

225
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
 out a word that you don't know yet right.

226
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
 The people who designed the AI said we're going to make it so you can't have people

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,180
 have sex but if there's a AI generated gibberish word for sex then you would put in that word

228
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,020
 and it would create the artwork.

229
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,260
 Because the designers didn't know that word existed until the AI invented it.

230
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
 Absolutely fascinating.

231
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,560
 We'll see where this story goes.

232
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,940
 But until then Angela Yoshi let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

233
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,380
 We are leaving behind University of Texas at Austin.

234
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,820
 We are headed all the way out.

235
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,940
 Oh to Houston, Texas.

236
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,440
 I don't even know how far away that is.

237
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,520
 I forgot both these stories took place in Texas.

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,920
 But as we're taking this short journey I want to give one more pitch for the asylum case

239
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,520
 studies that is hosted by a good friend of mine named Tressa.

240
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 It's a fantastic show.

241
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,200
 I've been on it three times now.

242
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,240
 The most recent episode we reviewed Megaparana.

243
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,120
 What she does is she brings on people and they watch asylum movies.

244
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,860
 There's like the sci-fi channel movies and we analyze them and sometimes they're great.

245
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,260
 Most of the time they are not but I have so much fun doing that show with Tressa.

246
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,300
 Tressa is currently trying out as well to be a co-host of a paranormal podcast called

247
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,340
 Late Night Legends or a co-co-co-host is how she put it.

248
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,180
 And I'm gonna they're having a vote.

249
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,140
 So if you're a fan of Dead Rabbit Radio, if you're a fan of the asylum case studies, go

250
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,720
 to the link and vote for Tressa to be a co-co-co-host of Late Night Legends.

251
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,000
 And maybe check out the podcast as well.

252
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,960
 I haven't checked it out Late Night Legends but it's another paranormal podcast.

253
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,520
 So maybe it's pretty dope.

254
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
 Tressa's pretty dope.

255
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,600
 So I'll take her word for it.

256
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,840
 Angela Yoshi go ahead and land this carpenter copter here at Houston, Texas.

257
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,400
 We're gonna wrap up season 18 with a really, really cool story.

258
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,480
 This episode might go a little long but this is a good one.

259
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,580
 In the year 1979 and the month of May, we're in the city of Houston, Texas and there's

260
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,260
 a young man.

261
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,460
 We don't have his name.

262
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,900
 This was reported in the amazing website ThinkAboutItDocs.com where we get a ton of paranormal

263
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,180
 stuff from such a crazy story.

264
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,140
 May 1979, Houston, Texas.

265
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,900
 We don't have his name but we're gonna go ahead and call him Philip.

266
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,900
 He is involved in a head-on collision with a drunk driver.

267
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,380
 It is completely unavoidable.

268
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,180
 It is completely not his fault.

269
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,040
 That doesn't matter, right?

270
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,320
 These cars collide together and not only is it a horrific car crash, Philip is trapped

271
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,760
 in the wreckage of his car.

272
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,200
 It takes a couple hours to get him out because his injuries are so severe they have to be

273
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,920
 very, very gentle.

274
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,200
 Any move could end this man's life.

275
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
 He's taken to the hospital.

276
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,880
 He's put in the ICU and a specialist comes in and they're doing all these tests and the

277
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,060
 specialist goes, "Okay, here's the thing.

278
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,580
 What we see is some massive trauma to your neck.

279
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:02,420
 The atlas vertebrae, the part of your spine that touches your skull, it's broken.

280
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,980
 We are gonna do everything we can for you not to die.

281
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,300
 I mean, that's why you're in the hospital, right?

282
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,900
 But you can't move and we still need to do tests.

283
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,140
 We don't know how much damage has been done to your skull, how much damage has been done

284
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,820
 to your brain.

285
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
 These things you do when you're in the hospital, right?

286
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,400
 You're like, "Oh man, in my brain, I kind of need that thing."

287
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,480
 So don't move.

288
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
 They have him immobilized here in the hospital.

289
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,320
 We're gonna have to run all these tests before we even can do anything, right?

290
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,960
 Philip says while he was laying there, he just passed the time by counting the ceiling

291
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
 tiles.

292
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,680
 You can't do anything.

293
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
 You're completely helpless in this situation.

294
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,560
 I would be terrified, right?

295
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,340
 But maybe when you're in this situation, if there's nothing you can do, you just have

296
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,620
 a calmness about you.

297
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
 Or maybe not.

298
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
 Maybe he was totally freaking out.

299
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
 I don't know.

300
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:02,260
 But he said he just laid there and counted the ceiling tiles and then he went blind.

301
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,060
 He was laying there for by his calculation a couple hours, laying there in the hospital

302
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,380
 and then he went blind.

303
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,000
 The first thing that popped in his head was, "I'm dead.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,880
 I've died.

305
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
 And this is what death is.

306
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,760
 It's just darkness."

307
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,240
 But then, through the darkness, he begins to accelerate.

308
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,400
 And he starts thinking, "This is it.

309
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
 This is my soul going somewhere."

310
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
 But while he's still trying to hold onto these thoughts of life and death and what comes next,

311
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:47,520
 his body, his essence is going faster and faster and faster and faster to a point unknown.

312
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:55,520
 He can feel the speed pushing him through the nothing.

313
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,700
 And he knows at this point that he's dead.

314
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,500
 He knows, for a matter of fact, that he's dead.

315
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,780
 And while he's holding onto this thought that his existence is over, he hears what he calls

316
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,040
 a quote, "Outside thought."

317
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
 He said, "It wasn't a voice in my head, but it wasn't me either.

318
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:23,040
 It was an outside thought and this thought, thought, release the fear."

319
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,680
 So Philip did.

320
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,840
 He starts to relax and as he's relaxing, he stops accelerating.

321
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,160
 He begins to slow down and then he comes to a stop.

322
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:44,100
 His vision comes back to him and he's standing in this long, rectangular room.

323
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,900
 He said the entire place was made of green stone.

324
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,860
 He described it as a deep green color.

325
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,300
 The ceiling, the floors, the walls, he's looking around and it's just this deep green color.

326
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,820
 But there was a glistening, crystalline surface laid over it.

327
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,880
 He walked up to one of the walls and he's looking at the detail and he's touching it and he

328
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,600
 said it was similar to granite.

329
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,880
 He had all these little fine features in it.

330
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,120
 He looks around, there's no doors, there's no windows in this giant rectangular stone

331
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,600
 building.

332
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 And there was no light source.

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
 But the place was completely lit up.

334
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,440
 He had no trouble seeing even though there were no windows and no lights.

335
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,860
 He turns and he sees that one end of the rectangle is empty.

336
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,260
 He just goes on to a certain point and then there's a wall.

337
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,700
 But when he turns and faces the opposite direction of the rectangle, he sees at the end seven

338
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,700
 evenly spaced three foot tall stone pedestals.

339
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,820
 And while he's looking at those, he gets the sensation that he is no longer alone.

340
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,220
 Something is in this room with him.

341
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,640
 Something is standing right behind him.

342
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:13,080
 And he turns around to see what it is and something is standing right behind him.

343
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:21,260
 He spins around again and something is standing right behind him.

344
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
 He couldn't face it.

345
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,380
 Whenever he turned around, it just reappeared behind him.

346
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,240
 He didn't know what this was but he didn't get a sense of evil.

347
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,980
 He wasn't scared of it.

348
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,740
 But he did get a sense that it wanted him to move.

349
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,240
 To where?

350
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
 Where is he going to go?

351
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,900
 He's in a giant stone rectangle.

352
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:51,900
 But this thing is insisting he moves and he starts to feel that it's insisting him to move

353
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
 towards the pedestals.

354
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,180
 It's urging him to go.

355
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,080
 But Phillip is not moving.

356
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,600
 Phillip is just standing there and this urge gets stronger and stronger.

357
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,800
 He's like, "Bro, I'm not moving.

358
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
 Dude, I just got teleported.

359
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,440
 I don't know if I'm dead.

360
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
 Where am I?

361
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,120
 I can't figure any of this out."

362
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,200
 And now this thing that won't face me is telling me to move and I'm not...

363
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
 Phillip gets shoved.

364
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
 Phillip straight gets pushed.

365
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,920
 And now he's sliding towards the pedestals.

366
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,840
 He passes the stone pedestals.

367
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,280
 He's headed straight to the green stone wall and this entity pushes him through the wall.

368
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:41,260
 He thought when he was originally accelerating through the deep darkness that that was nothing.

369
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,520
 But that was something.

370
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,300
 He just couldn't see it.

371
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,600
 Now he is nowhere.

372
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,660
 This is true.

373
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,540
 This is true oblivion.

374
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,900
 This is true nothingness.

375
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,740
 And he begins to accelerate once again.

376
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,740
 As he's flying through this void, the entity is still behind him, following him the entire

377
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
 way.

378
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,560
 And he flies through this void for a good deal of time.

379
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:24,520
 Until suddenly and instantly he is surrounded by the cosmos.

380
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,720
 He is floating through deep space.

381
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,380
 He looks in every direction and he sees stars and galaxies.

382
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,340
 He sees the beauty of creation all around him.

383
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,500
 And as he's standing here, flowing through the cosmos, a thought pops in his head.

384
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,420
 I want to be somewhere else.

385
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:52,780
 He begins accelerating again but this time he is flying through a different universe.

386
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,480
 He said I could tell that the stars were laid out in a different order.

387
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,680
 I wasn't in the same place I was before.

388
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,920
 When I said I wanted to be somewhere else, the entity actually took me, not to another

389
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,000
 portion of the galaxy, not to another edge of the universe, to a different universe.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,780
 He's floating through this new reality and he wants to know what's behind him.

391
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:20,040
 He needs to know what's behind him.

392
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,860
 And with great effort, he turns around and he sees it.

393
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:34,020
 He says the entity had a form of a glowing sphere of warm orange light.

394
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:44,020
 It had a reddish corona wrapping around it and there was a depth to the colors.

395
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,940
 He could tell this thing was conscious.

396
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,660
 He could tell that it had its own thought process.

397
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,000
 It wasn't just a mechanical beast or an animal.

398
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,120
 And he could also tell, even though this thing had no eyes or no visible eyes, that

399
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,600
 it was looking at Philip.

400
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,080
 He could tell that this thing was staring at him.

401
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:16,880
 And he could tell that the entity was waiting for Philip to make a decision.

402
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:28,100
 Philip reaches out to touch the orb and Philip says, "What do you want?"

403
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:39,020
 The orb slightly glided to Philip's right hand side.

404
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,220
 Philip blinks because the bright lights of the hospital are burning into his retinas.

405
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
 He can see again.

406
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,920
 He's back in his bed, completely immobilized, back on Earth.

407
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,040
 His real vision had returned.

408
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,480
 He was back in the broken body that he left.

409
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:05,960
 But the next day, the specialist came in and said, "Hey, Philip, hope you had a good night's

410
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
 sleep.

411
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
 I'm sure that you got a lot of rest thinking you could die at any moment."

412
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,840
 But speaking of that, we've run some tests.

413
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,460
 You have absolutely no skull injuries, brain injuries.

414
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,180
 You're totally fine on that.

415
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,340
 And that thing where we thought that your neck was broken, that's not true.

416
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,340
 Philip's like, "What are you talking about?

417
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,460
 You guys are having me strump down on this table.

418
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
 Did it heal?

419
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,460
 No, no, no, no, no.

420
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,180
 What's interesting is that we did see that your atlas vertebrae was fractured.

421
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,300
 Apparently, that is an old injury.

422
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,180
 We see, based on our X-rays and things like that, it looks like that happened when you

423
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,460
 were a child.

424
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,280
 And it's healed by now.

425
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,160
 When we got the report that you were injured in the car accident and the severity of it,

426
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,560
 when we saw those fractures, we assumed it was from that.

427
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,760
 But you're good to go.

428
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,080
 I can unstrap you right now.

429
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,000
 You can sit right up.

430
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,240
 Your neck is totally fine.

431
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,200
 Any injury that you had actually came from childhood.

432
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,560
 And Philip said, "I never had an injury like that in my childhood."

433
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,860
 Like, you're basically telling me that I broke my neck as a kid?

434
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,900
 Specialist is like, "Yeah, I mean, we can see trauma to that area, but it's completely

435
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
 healed.

436
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,420
 If you were injured in any way, it would have been as a child.

437
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:30,780
 The injury is completely healed and you're good to go."

438
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,180
 What a fascinating story.

439
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,980
 And really, for me, what a way to wrap up season 18.

440
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,280
 Because there are so many ways we can go with this.

441
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,160
 First off, near-death experience, right?

442
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
 Traveling to beyond.

443
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,720
 Did he die in that room?

444
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
 So, yeah, I mean, let's start breaking it down.

445
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
 Did he die in that room?

446
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,800
 And this is, once again, we've covered it a couple of times this season.

447
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,360
 Again, I hope I'm not beating a dead horse or beating a horse into quantum immortality.

448
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,360
 But quantum immortality, this idea that when you die, you can get slotted into another reality.

449
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,240
 Which I find fascinating.

450
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,060
 Am I completely sold on the concept?

451
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,100
 No, but I do find incidents of it interesting.

452
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,380
 We covered one earlier this week, I think, even yesterday.

453
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,300
 But this isn't just that, right?

454
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,820
 You do have that theory that he died and then he got teleported into a body where he was

455
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
 alive.

456
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,780
 Like, maybe he did go, "Shut down the table!"

457
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,100
 He saw Albun and the Chipmunks was on TV and he reached for the remote and he died.

458
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,540
 And then he got slotted into a reality where Albun and the Chipmunks was and on TV that

459
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,220
 day so he didn't reach for the remote.

460
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
 You have that.

461
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,440
 But then, even extrapolating that, when we look at things like quantum immortality, we've

462
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,360
 had stories, and I'll put these all in the show notes, of the one kid who drowned and

463
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,280
 then he ended up in a version of himself that knew how to swim.

464
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,960
 And the one we covered earlier this week, the kid who may have shot himself with a gun.

465
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,480
 I think that was Wednesday's episode, but then he entered a world where he was still

466
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,920
 alive but he remembered rotting in the grave.

467
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,640
 These are all really interesting and actually quite terrifying versions of quantum immortality.

468
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,740
 What's interesting about this story is he doesn't just shift realities, he shifts COSMOSES.

469
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,820
 Is that a plural, COSMOSE-I?

470
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:20,420
 He saw the constellations laid out in a different order.

471
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,620
 That's mind-boggling.

472
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,520
 I don't know why I've never really thought about that.

473
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,100
 We talk about the Berenstein Bears and the Berenstain Bears.

474
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:37,800
 But when you quantum immortality, that's a word, imagine not just going into a life

475
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,320
 so similar that you kind of remember it, maybe people are like, "Oh yeah, I know."

476
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,200
 He went to a place where the constellations look different.

477
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,240
 The universe itself was laid out differently.

478
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,160
 And then I started to think, I mean, I really ran with this story.

479
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,600
 I started thinking, "What if, because you have people who swear up and down that aliens

480
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,340
 are real and they've seen aliens, they've been abducted by aliens, while the majority,

481
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,740
 way more people have seen ghosts than have seen aliens."

482
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,860
 I'm not talking about UFOs, I'm not talking about something in the sky that's unidentified.

483
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:17,260
 Pound for pound, more people have seen ghosts than have ever seen an alien life form.

484
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:24,100
 And I started thinking, "What if the people who see aliens are from another reality?"

485
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,140
 They came from a reality where alien encounters were more common.

486
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:33,480
 They died, they shifted into our world where they're very, very rare.

487
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,600
 They're probably one of the most rare paranormal phenomena.

488
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,320
 They're a little bit above Bigfoot.

489
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,160
 But they're nowhere near ghosts, nowhere near ghosts.

490
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,560
 Because the cosmos would have been different in their reality.

491
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,920
 We look in this reality, well, the closest star is Alpha Centauri that can possibly hold

492
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,560
 life and that's what like 50 light years away.

493
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,620
 Well what if they're coming from a reality where Alpha Centauri was only 10 light years

494
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,860
 away or 5?

495
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,140
 Maybe in their reality, alien travel, alien abductions is more common.

496
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,980
 And then they slip getting out of their bathtub and they shift over to our universe and they

497
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,840
 tell us these stories about grey aliens or these human aliens wearing spacesuits or little

498
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,180
 green men or whatever and we're like, "Well, that's really cool."

499
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,280
 Dude, we don't get those interactions here because our universes are laid out differently.

500
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,120
 Fascinating, I mean am I saying that's the end all be all?

501
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,280
 No, no, but maybe.

502
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,640
 Maybe we're constantly just shifting from reality to reality because to be honest, unless the

503
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,160
 big, actually I don't even know where the Big Dipper is.

504
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,600
 I can look up and see the Big Dipper but all of a sudden if it was on the other side of

505
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
 the sky, I don't know.

506
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 Right?

507
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 I don't know.

508
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,140
 It's so fascinating to think that the entire universe could change.

509
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,300
 It's not just you go to a reality where things are slightly different, where things are so

510
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,320
 different that you don't even notice that you died in one reality and shifted to the

511
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 other.

512
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,680
 The cosmos has changed.

513
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,240
 The layout of the universe, literally in one reality, life could have evolved on another

514
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:19,100
 planet to gain interstellar travel and then in 50 million other realities that never happened.

515
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,080
 This story is so fascinating to me.

516
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,600
 It really, really is.

517
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,120
 Then you also have the idea of this, the story we covered about the young boy who may have

518
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,360
 shot himself in one reality and then saw all the bugs come out of the box and that may

519
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,720
 have represented his decay and that like he had a memory of being dead, which is again

520
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,000
 absolutely terrifying.

521
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,240
 This man suffered severe injuries in a car crash.

522
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,560
 Quantum immortality, he shifts into a reality where that happened to him as a kid or where

523
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,920
 the injury is so traumatic that when he shifted into this reality they were still there but

524
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
 they were so traumatic.

525
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:05,400
 They were still there because they were so traumatic but they had healed.

526
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,720
 There's so many interesting things.

527
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,680
 Generally in these type of stories, the kid who may have shot himself with a gun, I hate

528
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,840
 to keep going back to that one.

529
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,280
 I hate even saying that sentence because it's so bleak.

530
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,120
 He didn't have a bullet hole in his neck when he came to the new reality.

531
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
 He's like, "Hey Ma, check out my new scar.

532
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,800
 So why would the injuries carry over into the new universe?"

533
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 I don't know.

534
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
 This is absolutely...

535
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,160
 And I'm really fixated on the quantum immortality thing.

536
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,600
 This could easily just be classified as a classic near-death experience like he was going

537
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,680
 and when he asked the orb, "What do you want?"

538
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,640
 The orb wanted him back alive.

539
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,920
 Let's forget the whole quantum immortality thing.

540
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,920
 The orb wanted him back on Earth and it healed his wounds.

541
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,320
 It healed him in such a way that it looked like they'd been healed for decades because

542
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,920
 Philip swears, "I never got in an accident like that when I was a kid."

543
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,920
 Although if you get in an accident like that was a kid, you probably want to remember it.

544
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,520
 You might have had severe brain damage back then but honestly, he doesn't remember it.

545
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,200
 When he asked the orb, "What do you want?"

546
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,240
 He was sent back to Earth.

547
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,280
 So it was like it wanted him here, wanted him back for some reason.

548
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,000
 Now, obviously the skeptical answer was this guy was dreaming.

549
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 This was a dream.

550
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,800
 It was a stressful situation and he fell asleep, Jason.

551
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,880
 Generally when people don't move for a couple hours, they fall asleep and that's fair.

552
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,000
 The skeptical answer is fair.

553
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,720
 And also you could just say the entire story's made up with these stories.

554
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
 You could always say that.

555
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,560
 But assuming that it's not, that this actually happened, you could say that he fell asleep.

556
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,960
 Well, generally, yeah, people do sleep and they don't move for a long time.

557
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,800
 But when you wake up, your wounds aren't healed.

558
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,040
 If you break your arm, you're like, "Ah, good napal cure.

559
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,000
 You don't wake up and your arms back together."

560
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 So I don't think the skeptical answer really washes with that one.

561
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,440
 That he just had a good snooze and everything was okay.

562
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,560
 Fascinating story.

563
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
 Fascinating story.

564
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,320
 You have a man who really probably died, right?

565
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,160
 He was so precariously holding on to life in this physical form and he saw the afterlife.

566
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,480
 He went through pretty much all of the phases.

567
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,080
 He went to the oblivion.

568
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,160
 He went to nothingness.

569
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:26,320
 And then he saw the beauty of creation with a guardian or a guide with him on that journey.

570
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,800
 So classic life after death story or near death experience story.

571
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,080
 And then classic quantum immortality story coming back to a reality where the injury

572
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,880
 hadn't happened.

573
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,960
 I love stories like this again.

574
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
 I hope I'm not doing too many of them.

575
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 I just find them absolutely engaging.

576
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,080
 And I'm not entirely sold on the quantum immortality thing either.

577
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,560
 It's just so interesting to me, especially when their experience is this vivid.

578
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,160
 And I thought, what a way to end season 18.

579
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,200
 Because you know, death is something that we all think about.

580
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,800
 Some people think about it a little more than others.

581
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,680
 I think about it all the time.

582
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,800
 Losing people close to me, losing myself.

583
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,160
 And I think that's why I kind of gravitate to these stories.

584
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,080
 Because it tells me that even though I may feel sorrow in this universe, in another

585
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,960
 universe I may not be in sorrow.

586
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,800
 I may still have that person in my life.

587
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,000
 And if I don't, right?

588
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,520
 If I don't, I believe that when you die, you can go to paradise.

589
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,080
 And so stories like this just make me think of the people that I've lost and what wonders

590
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,360
 they must be seeing.

591
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,240
 What great mysteries they must be unraveling.

592
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,520
 Stories like this aren't just stories of really cool visuals and people standing on

593
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,120
 the edge of eternity.

594
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,520
 It's also stories of hope, right?

595
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,120
 I don't believe people just disappear when they die.

596
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,000
 I believe there is something else.

597
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,360
 And these type of stories just make me kind of happy too.

598
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,160
 It's part of this mystery, but it's also going, I'm glad that the people close to me who have

599
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,880
 passed on are part of such an amazing cosmic journey.

600
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,840
 These aren't just really cool mystery stories.

601
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,880
 To me they're stories of hope.

602
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,360
 What a better way to end season 18 than to constantly talk about a little kid shooting

603
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,960
 himself in the head and hope.

604
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,840
 I hope you guys have an amazing two weeks while I'm taking my break.

605
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,760
 I will be playing a bunch of video games and having a bunch of fun and I hope you guys

606
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
 are doing the same.

607

615
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

616
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
 I'm so glad you listened to it today.

617
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
 Have a great time while I'm done.

618
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
 I'll see you guys next time.

619
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:48,760
 Bye.

620

 Bye.

622
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:29,760

 Bye.
