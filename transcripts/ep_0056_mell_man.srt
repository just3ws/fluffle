00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Today we take a look at the incredible, edible medicinal mummy today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,800
 [music]

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,500
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,800
 I'm having a better day than I did yesterday.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 Man, that episode made me mad.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,800
 And again, like I said, it was the fifth time I had recorded that story.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,000
 Sometimes you gotta be the bad guy though.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
 Sometimes you gotta be the bad guy.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,400
 I like believing in this stuff, man.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,900
 But I don't like believing in it when it's dangerous.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,500
 Like the public monster I think is more realistic.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,900
 Like you know what, I'm not even gonna...

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,000
 Okay.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 The last yesterday's episode was yesterday's episode.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,900
 It was recorded.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,800
 And I'm moving on.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,300
 Today's episode is gonna be short though.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,500
 Because this was originally supposed to be the second story in yesterday's episode.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,600
 And I was like, you know what?

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,100
 I'm just gonna give it its own little episode.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,800
 Nice little come down from yesterday's episode.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,700
 And if you're interested in yesterday's episode, go ahead and check the feed.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,900
 If you haven't listened to it.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
 If you're a new listener, thanks for checking in.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,000
 If you're an old listener, thanks for coming back.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Sounded super cheesy.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,800
 But let's get into the incredible edible medicinal mummy.

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,300
 And I know that sounds completely ridiculous and made up,

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,100
 but it is actually true.

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,000
 Maybe.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 It's very interesting.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,700
 It's a very interesting story.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,700
 So there is a thing called a mellified man.

36
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,900
 And this comes out of a document written by a Chinese doctor in the 16th century.

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,800
 And he had heard this story from some men in the Middle East.

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,300
 So you know, everyone's kind of traveling.

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,700
 The 16th century is pretty late in human history.

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,800
 People are, you know, know other continents exist.

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,700
 And they're kind of like traveling around, meeting stuff.

42
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,600
 And so this Chinese doctor, Lee Shizen.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,200
 Lee Shizen.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,100
 Doesn't matter.

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,900
 Anyways, I shouldn't say it doesn't matter, but I can't pronounce it.

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,500
 So.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 So the doctor's name, Lee, Lee Shizen, Shizhen.

48
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,600
 Back in the 16th century, he writes this book about 16, like medicine of that time period.

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
 And when he's talking to these people in the Middle East,

50
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,300
 here's the story of the mellified man.

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,500
 So what's a mellified man?

52
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,100
 It's fascinating and a little creepy and possibly tasty.

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,400
 So what you do is when a man is getting old, so like 70s and 80s is normally when this would start.

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,700
 You know, it's a common misconception that humans used to only live 40 years.

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,300
 That's the, that was the average lifespan.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,000
 And the reason why it was so low, because we had such high infant death rates.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
 People did live to be 60, 70, 80 years old, hundreds of years ago.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 When you hear people go, well, you know, 40s old back.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600
 Benjamin Franklin was 40.

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,900
 That's old because, you know, you only live to be 40.

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,600
 That's not true.

62
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,100
 People lived, our human race wouldn't evolve if everyone was dropping dead at 40.

63
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,500
 The average age was 40 because infant mortality and, you know, kids dying at one and two and three was so high

64
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,200
 that they were dropping down the average.

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,400
 People did live to be 60, 70, 80 years old back then.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,700
 It wasn't completely uncommon for Benjamin Franklin to be 60 something and Thomas Edison to all that stuff.

67
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
 To be older than 40 or 35, which is what the average has always been stated.

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,600
 But anyways, so these old men would basically donate their body to science.

69
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,900
 And they were back to 16th century.

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,200
 This story that this Chinese doctor heard in the Middle East.

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,900
 These old men would say, you know what, I've lived a good life.

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,500
 I'm going to donate my body to science.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 Well, how do you do that?

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,200
 Eat honey.

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,700
 Just eat honey.

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
 That's all you eat is honey all the time.

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
 You begin to bathe in honey.

78
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,200
 So your only meals are honey.

79
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 You bathe in honey.

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
 You drink honey.

81
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:52,200
 You get to the point where reportedly even your sweat is honey and your poop, you poop honey.

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 There's nothing else in your system.

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 It doesn't come out as poop.

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 It comes out as honey.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
 That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 That sounds like slow diarrhea, slow thick diarrhea, which I can't imagine a worse combination of words.

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,700
 Slow, thick, thorny diarrhea would be the only way that would be worse.

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,700
 So you drink and eat honey.

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
 You poop out long, slow, diarrhea bouts of honey.

90
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,200
 And you die, obviously, because you're not getting enough nutrition.

91
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,700
 But you're soaked with honey.

92
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,200
 How's that donating your body to science, Jason?

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 Hold up.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 There's a couple more steps here.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,200
 You then take the honey-soaked man and you put him in a coffin full of honey.

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,700
 And you seal it and you put the month and the date of when you've sealed the coffin and you store it away.

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 100 years later, the concoction is complete.

98
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,700
 You open it up and now at this point the body is basically like just one with the honey.

99
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,200
 And you begin scooping out honey with bits of people in it.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
 And you eat it, cures all sorts of diseases.

101
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
 You have a broken bone or a fracture.

102
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
 You can rub the malefied man on your skin.

103
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 It'll heal the bone.

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,700
 This was something that was incredibly expensive.

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,200
 If you think about it, it took 100 years to make and a human body.

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,700
 So it wasn't something that you could go to, you know, the equivalent of a Kmart to do it.

107
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
 It was something that was generally sold to the wealthy or in back offices and things like that.

108
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,700
 The Chinese doctor was like, "Oh my God, that's absolutely insane."

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,200
 He said, the actual author, the Li Shenzhen, said,

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,700
 "I myself do not know whether the tale is true or not.

111
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,700
 In any case, I append it for the consideration of the learned."

112
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,700
 So he's putting it in his book, but he's saying, "I don't know if this is true or not."

113
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,200
 One, because it's something that he's hearing secondhand.

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 So that's the smart thing to do, to be like, you know, I didn't witness it.

115
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,700
 I didn't eat any malefied man.

116
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,200
 So it may not be true, but I'm putting it in here because it's a cultural practice.

117
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,200
 They haven't found any proof of this, but they do know that honey was used to embalm people.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,700
 We have found people who were embalmed with honey.

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,200
 And what's interesting, I was reading, stay up at the link below, but they found a stone age.

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,700
 They did an excavation of like a stone age burial spot.

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,700
 And some of the bodies had what they call, I think it was like, broken bee legs and nectar.

122
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,700
 And they believe that that was just byproducts from the honey dissolving, like you got down to the pure basics.

123
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
 It's kind of horrible to think that a bunch of bees are breaking their legs while they're making honey.

124
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,200
 But so we do know that honey has been used for mummification or burials because it's actually an amazing preservative.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,700
 You know that it will keep the body sticking around for a super long time.

126
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:43,200
 We also know in Buddhism, there is what's called self mummification, where they go through this long process of actually mummifying themselves while they're alive.

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,700
 They stop eating certain types of food.

128
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,700
 Basically, their goal is to purify their body before they die.

129
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,200
 And they'll stop eating certain types of fruit.

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 Eventually, they'll just start eating like roots and rocks, I guess, so they feel full.

131
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,700
 Sounds terrible. And then when they die, the point is they want no parasites in them whatsoever.

132
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,700
 They basically want to naturally delay the decay process as long as possible.

133
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:13,700
 And you go into the lotus pose and you basically ring, like the point where you've just been eating roots and rocks for a while.

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,700
 You know the end's almost there.

135
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,700
 The monks will put you in the lotus pose and they give you a bell and you ring it every once in a while.

136
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,700
 I'm sure if you wanted to be a dick, you could just keep going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

137
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,200
 But you ring it every once in a while and then when the other monks hear the bell stop ringing, they know you're dead.

138
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 And they close you in a tomb and they give it a period, I believe, of a year or more.

139
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 And then they open the tomb back up and if you haven't decayed, they take you out of the tomb.

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 You're still in the lotus pose and they put you on display.

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,200
 If you have decayed, they just shut the door and you kind of, you know, you kind of suck because you didn't do it right, apparently.

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 It's funny because they have a picture of one of the self mummified guys and he's in his traditional robes

143
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,700
 and his face is all, you know, desiccated, but it's not like super, like he's just dried out.

144
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
 He doesn't, not rotting.

145
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
 He's wearing a pair of modern sunglasses.

146
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:06,700
 I'm assuming it's because your eyes, like liquefy, or they would just be terrible to see dead people stare at you all the time.

147
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
 But it's a little ridiculous.

148
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,700
 They couldn't even make, like, ornamental sunglasses or make it kind of fit the look they're going for.

149
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,700
 So we, so, I mean, self mummification is possible.

150
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 They do preserve people with honey.

151
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,200
 The Chinese actually have a big book about recipes that can be used using human body parts.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
 So all of these elements work.

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
 It's funny. I was looking at some of the recipes that they use.

154
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:37,200
 Some of the ingredients they use for these Chinese recipes, the human hair cut off of head, human hair collected from a comb.

155
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
 Two different, two different ingredients, apparently.

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
 Human earwax, human knee dirt.

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:52,200
 There's 33 recipes that include human feces, but oddly enough, zero recipes, including human feces from a newborn.

158
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
 Luckily, that sounds disgusting.

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:03,700
 There is recipes involving human menstrual blood and human semen, but apparently, evil wizards combine the both of them,

160
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,700
 and they shortens their lifespan because the energy is too much.

161
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:14,700
 So, you know, there's a ton of stuff about these human body part curals.

162
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,200
 Like, if you just use the semen, it gives you power, and if you just use the menstrual blood, it can kind of give you power,

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 but if you mix them, it gives you too much power and you burn out quickly.

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
 So all the elements of the malefied man are verifiable.

165
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 I'm, okay, let me back up.

166
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
 I don't think actually drinking human semen gives you more power.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:40,700
 What I'm saying is that the practice of using human remains or human body parts for magic is people have done that, people have mummified people in honey,

168
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
 and people have done self-mummification.

169
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
 The question is, have people actually done the malefied man?

170
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
 I would be surprised if they don't, if they didn't.

171
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,700
 I would be surprised if they don't still do it today.

172
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,700
 I would be shocked if there's not some super rich guy in the world today who has not tried eating a malefied man.

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,200
 And just for the experience of it, if you, I mean think about it, you can have the finest wines in the world,

174
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 you can have the finest women of the world, you can see the most beautiful sunsets,

175
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,700
 and then one day you go to this party with all these super rich people and they're like,

176
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
 "Hey man, keep quiet on those golf rumors."

177
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,700
 And the other guy's like, "Yeah, of course, nobody talks about golf rumors."

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,200
 And he goes, "Hey, have you ever eaten a honey-soaked human bean?"

179
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 Don't worry, he wasn't violently killed, he did it because he wanted to.

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,700
 But how would you like to have a spoonful of human honey?

181
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,200
 Who would, okay, who would say, "Nah, I'm good."

182
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,700
 Because as long as the person didn't, like, as long as he wasn't like, ritually sacrificed to it,

183
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,700
 if some guy's like, "You know what I want to be when I grow up?

184
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
 Honey."

185
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
 And then he grows up and becomes honey.

186
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
 And then someone offers me said honey.

187
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
 I mean the honey.

188
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,700
 I think at a certain point, it's not cannibalism, it's just...

189
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,200
 Man, made of honey?

190
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,700
 Like, is that really cannibalism at this point?

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
 Have I just outed myself as cannibal?

192
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,200
 I would, if someone gave me a steak and they're like, "Wait, what's this?"

193
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,700
 And they're like, "It's Tony."

194
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
 I'm not eating the steak.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 But if someone gave me a bowl of honey, and I'm like, "What are these flakes?"

196
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 And they're like, "Oh, that was Tony's great-great-grandpa."

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 All he ever wanted to be was a sweet confection.

198
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
 That's all he ever wanted to be.

199
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,700
 He loved Willy Wonka that much that he wanted.

200
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,200
 When he saw that fat kid fall into the chocolate river,

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
 he orgasmed.

202
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 That's all he ever wanted to be was candy.

203
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 And now he is.

204
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 You want to take a bite?

205
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,700
 I think I'd take a bite.

206
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,200
 And I definitely think that this is something that's still around.

207
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 I would be shocked, shocked, if they still aren't making mellified men.

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,700
 And because the process takes so long, the people you'd be eating would be like Jesse James and Thomas Edison.

209
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
 Would Thomas Edison know?

210
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
 He died in like the mid-century.

211
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
 He'll be coming up.

212
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,200
 We could probably eat Thomas Edison in about another 30 years, if he was made of honey.

213
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 So that's the story of a malefied man.

214
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,700
 Definitely possible.

215
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,700
 Definitely scientifically possible, I think, other than the poop and honey.

216
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
 I don't know about that.

217
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,700
 And it's something that I think people have done in the past and probably still do it today.

218
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
 Healthy dose of cautions, obviously.

219
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
 It could be completely made up in an urban legend.

220
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,200
 That sounds vaguely plausible.

221
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,700
 My question to you is, would you eat a honey-soaked man?

222
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,700
 Hit me up at DeadrabbitRadio@gmail.com.

223
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,200
 Do not send me recipes of other human body parts, like I said.

224
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 I'm not into eating humans.

225
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 They have to be dead for 100 years and soaked in honey.

226
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 DeadrabbitRadio@gmail.com.

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,700
 Yes, I've seen how to prepare a live girl.

228
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
 I don't need that copy pasta anymore.

229
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 What was the other one?

230
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 Oh, see, you made me forget.

231
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
 Facebook.com/DeadrabbitRadio is going to be our Facebook page.

232
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 We're also available on Twitter at JasonOCarpenter.

233
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,700
 DeadrabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

234
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,700
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

235
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
 Have a great one, guys.
