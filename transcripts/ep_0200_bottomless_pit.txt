 Can bees live in your eyeballs?
 Can mannequins move on their own and then we travel down into the earth as we explore the mysteries of
 Bottomless pits today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's the 200th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio
 We've almost been out this for a year. We started I think it was in
 June June of last year. We're almost at a full year
 But we're definitely 200 episodes in that's kind of cool. It's kind of nice
 I don't know what I don't know what else to say. I appreciate that you guys are coming back to the show
 Listening to it. Our download numbers are always going up. Now the first news story. I saw pop-up
 Quite a few days ago, and I thought that's fake. That's absolutely fake
 Recently we're in Taiwan. There was this woman named he who goes to the graveyard to go visit her relatives
 It's not like they were living there anything they were buried and she went down there
 And she wanted to tidy up their graves so she began pulling weeds and then she's like ah my eyeball and goes home
 She's like damn ancestors should be protecting me
 She goes home and her eyeball keeps hurting and itching and stuff like that
 And she can't figure out what it is and so she goes to the eye doctor
 I'm sure going to try to pronounce the word but I'm just calling the eye doctor and the eye doctor starts looking in there
 And he says not the woman but the doctor the pronoun as in he has the doctor said
 It looked like there was an insect leg in there and when he began poking around there was four
 Sweatbees in her eyeball like not like actually in the ball itself
 But like around the eyeball on the inside
 Drinking her tears and I'm like that story is fake the story is 100% fake and
 Then I saw it pop up the next day and it was kind of the same thing when I go up fake news spreading around
 How would you not know there's I could understand if there was one bee in your eyeball?
 Maybe but four bees in your eyeball and apparently sweat bees are really small, but I was still super
 I was like that's not true and then finally another article came out today
 And they actually included video footage of a press conference where the young woman and the doctor
 Gave a press conference with photographs of
 The bees in her eyeball now
 I had seen photographs of bees on an eyeball and earlier things that I think that's just like some mock-up
 But apparently it's real. I mean they held a full press conference and these people are given interviews
 I don't understand what they're saying
 But they kept cutting back to pictures of bees and eyeballs and it was like this big news deal
 I don't think of that. I do think it's real. How do you go about your day with four bees in your eyeballs?
 I always heard this urban legend quote-unquote urban legend. It may be true
 But I heard a long time ago. There was a young wife a young hot blonde a young beautiful hot blonde wife
 Sitting there in her yoga pants and her tank top her tight tank top
 Press against her body. Anyways, I don't know what she was wearing the point. That's what I hope she was wearing
 She was mailing wedding invitations and she was licking the envelopes
 But in the letter you guys know how you stick put a letter in but anyway, she's licking the envelopes
 She's licking the envelopes and eventually she licks and she gets a paper cut on her tongue. Ow
 Only there was a Jason here to kiss my tongue and make me feel better
 But I wasn't there and she just kind of went about her business. It's really hard to to treat a tongue wound
 But then a couple days later, maybe a couple weeks later. I'm not exactly for sure of the time period
 I was just horrified at the story her tongue begins to throb and starts to like
 pulsate
 And she's swelling up. She's not swelling up her tongue is swelling up if she was swelling up that would be a different story
 That'd be a very very sexy story
 Anyways, eventually she goes to the dentist and the dentist is like you need to go to the doctor because that is completely abnormal
 Tongues shouldn't pulsate. They shouldn't
 Undulate in your mouth. She then goes to the doctor and the doctor's looking at it
 And he's like, oh, yeah, that's looks like maybe you have like a really bad infection. She might want to eat in a week
 Can you help me doctors like yeah, I can understand you and I can help you and
 He cuts her tongue open and a bunch of cockroaches came out now
 I doubt that story is true
 The the this that was a story that I heard and which the cockroach had a cockroach had laid eggs
 That got stuck to the envelope and when she licked it and cut her tongue
 The eggs went into her tongue and they fed off of the blood and saliva in her mouth
 So they became full-grown cockroaches and the pulse I'm getting grossed out just thinking about it
 the pulsating of her tongue where the cockroaches
 Crawling over each other and they cut it out and all the cockroaches came out again
 I don't know if that's a real story, but that's quite disgusting and whenever I lick an envelope
 Which I very rarely do nowadays. I think of that story
 But that's enough of cockroaches apparently the bee lady is cool like they got the bees out
 But man, that's pretty disgusting
 But I wouldn't much rather take bees in my eyes than cockroaches in my mouth and no I'm not gonna make a dick joke there
 But I was very tempted to halfway through that story
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story now our next story is kind of weird
 Because it's something that I'm sure has a simple answer
 But everyone in the neighborhood is being really tight-lipped about it. We are going to a place called Wappenger's
 Falls, New York Wappenger's fall. Oh, yeah, that's the only way I can pronounce that word
 Wappingers. Anyways, we're going there. We're going to a place with the last word falls in New York
 The year is 1871. There's a choo-choo train driving along riding along the rails and there's a horrible accident
 *makes noise*
 21 people are killed sorry 22 people are killed
 That's why I have notes and not only that but the train actually derailed and smashed through a neighborhood
 So that was bad, right? That's a bad that's a bad combination of things
 1877 so only five years later a massive fire rips through that same neighborhood and all but two buildings are burned down a house
 And then I think like a bigger house or factory or something like that
 But you're like, okay, what does that have to do with anything jason a train crash fire?
 Where you going with this? Does this story involve a sexy sexy bride with something swollen in her mouth?
 And no, unfortunately not this story involves something equally sexy in a weird way. There is a house
 There is a house that lives that lives there is a house that is in that neighborhood
 Known as the john loson house and what makes this house noticeable or
 Remarkable is the fact that it is inhabited by only three mannequins
 So there's three mannequins dressed up in period clothing. So like older time clothing. They're not wearing juicy couture
 You know, they're just kind of wearing like frilly dresses and little sun hats and stuff like that
 So you walk by the house and you just see these three mannequins sitting in the kitchen
 They're like, that's kind of bizarre. It's kind of weird
 You've never seen anyone else in the house
 Now that would is just bizarre enough. You're thinking maybe there's a serial killer there
 You're thinking all sorts of weirdness stuff, but you're like three mannequins. That's fine
 But then a couple days later you walk by the house again
 And now you see two of the mannequins sitting on the porch
 And one of them inside the living room looking out of the window
 And you go, oh, okay. So it's some sort of joke like some guys moving around mannequins in there
 Puts them out on the porch dresses them up in old timey clothing
 You know, whatever one of them's left out one of them's inside playing solitaire because she's the lonely one
 But then you notice that almost every time you pass by that house the mannequins are in a different position
 When the weather is bad, they are never outside. That's one one pattern you notice
 But a lot of times you'll see them sitting on the porch. Sometimes all of them sometimes just one or two of them
 You'll see them inside and they'll be in poses. It's not like they're just leaning up against stuff
 They're dressed in different clothing than the last time you saw them. That's all you know
 Now neighbors have reported that on occasion there is a light on in the kitchen, but the drapes are closed shut
 But other than that nobody knows who lives in the house
 Nobody knows who's doing this
 There's something creepy about mannequins. It's really bizarre like I remember their twilight zone episode where the mannequins come to
 Life and that was kind of spooky that was kind of spooky and like a weird surreal way because spoiler alert
 The girl didn't know she was a mannequin and she like escaped and lived her life
 Like once a year one of the mannequins got to spend a day out
 But this one mannequin went out and then developed this whole false memory
 Knit forgot she was a mannequin and then one day she goes shopping in the stores and the mannequins
 Adopt her and turn her back into a mannequin that that kind of creeped me out because it was just kind of a weird story
 But the fact that they like look like human and they're they're not and they just kind of stand in human poses
 And the fact that most of the time they're really really hot. They're really sexy
 You very rarely see an unattractive mannequin
 I guess the ones that are missing their heads and their arms and their legs are pretty unattractive
 But even then they got a little nice little hourglass shape
 But generally mannequins are pretty hot now when I was reading about the story
 I was it was kind of bringing me back to that childhood thing like oh man
 That would be so spooky to like have mannequins walk around. There's something just creepy about that
 But of course I kept digging because I'm like logically this is impossible
 If there was a house that mannequins were walking around then
 One of two things would have happened
 One the government would have come in and taken those mannequins and turned them into super soldiers
 Or at least found out what sort of phenomenon was happening in this house
 Or two this would be the only story that was ever covered on every paranormal website ever
 If it was 100 true that these mannequins could be documented moving around
 It would be the first ghost story you ever heard as a kid
 So I kept digging and it turns out
 That the idea that nobody knows who lives there is a bit of a
 Misleading statement because as a boggett for a long time that statement was true
 But as of now since august 2016 the mannequins are gone from the house
 And when people started asking one of the neighbors said
 The mannequins are removed out by the person who owned that house
 And now they're in another house, but you can't go there and I won't tell you where it's at
 So I do know who lived there, but I'm not going to tell you who it was
 I'm not going to tell you where they went. I'm just telling you that the mannequins are gone
 So that I think still leads us back to our first theory
 If these things were real and I believe there are real paranormal things that kind of fly under the radar
 But if I'm able to stumble across that one late night while I'm you know just scrolling through stuff
 Then I'm sure the CIA could find it
 But it leads us back to that theory. What if these mannequins were real and they were being spotted in this area?
 And they're in this house moving around and the first thing that happens is the government would come out because they would
 Investigate anything that was weird. I got a story prepped coming up for next season as well about
 Russia's psychic spies that they just like announced in their newsletter
 That's the whole thing. I really have to dig into that but governments do look into this stuff
 So if the government came out and found that this was a real phenomenon
 They stood out there for a few days in a surveillance van. They saw you walking back and forth going what?
 Like golly the mannequins are still moving around
 But they're surveilling the place and they don't see anyone coming in they would go in
 Examine what was going on and if there was something paranormal going on they would simply take the mannequins
 And then they could just have like some CIA agent pretending to be a neighbor being like oh, yeah, I live there
 They moved away mannequins everything moved away
 And then people go like oh that's the end of that mystery
 While really these mannequins are like being trained in some CIA
 CIA warehouse to like fight other mannequins there to fight other inanimate objects are these things real?
 It's most likely it was an art installation. Some guy was goofing around
 It could have been some weird fetish thing too could be that souls of people who died in that train crash
 You're like, yeah, why should you mention all that stuff in the beginning?
 Could be that souls of people who died in that train crash inhabited those
 mannequins
 The most likely one obviously is it's some sort of art thing or sex thing
 But if these things are real
 They're not just at someone's house that this neighbor won't say where it's at
 They're being fully examined by government or non-governmental agencies to find out what makes these things work
 And how to make more of them
 Moral of the story
 Do not get lost in a macy's or seers
 ever
 Because you don't know which one of those mannequins could actually be a spook in more ways than one
 For new listeners of the show, I use the word spook and it's meaning as an FBI or a CIA spy
 I do not mean it as a racial slur. I'm not saying watch out for black mannequins a long time listeners of this show
 I'm sure are well aware of the fact that I use the word spook a lot
 That's not a racist slur. Okay. I figured I had to jump in there just in case you're like
 My dear that guy's super racist. He doesn't like black mannequins. I love all mannequins
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our last story here
 The next story is something that I was always intrigued about as a child
 I think a lot of people were just because the imagery is so bizarre and it really tests the limits of what's physically possible
 We know they exist in space
 But do they exist in earth?
 I'm talking about bottomless pits
 Now, obviously I'm talking about black holes in space, but you know just a pit that goes on forever
 Would defy all logic all physics
 But it's something that there's just something really like enthralling about that idea
 So I started looking into bottomless not literally I wish I don't know if I knew a pit was bottomless
 If I knew a pit was 100 feet deep, I don't think I'd look into it like I don't like
 Looking into the pitch black abyss
 Especially if it's high maybe if it's like three foot and I look down and I see cthulhu
 I'd be like oh, it's kind of cool
 But I want to want to look down a giant abyss
 And see cthulhu even though he'd be farther away. I'd be safer
 There's quite a few stories about bottomless pits the stories that I found seemed to center in
 America and two of them are actually quite close to each other
 But for our stories the first two are actually only small entries that were in this book called weird usa
 Which we've had some run-ins with before
 They're the ones who talked about spider web gate cemetery, which was just absolutely just
 Garbage information, so I'm always a little iffy on weird us books. I'm sure the authors are lovely people
 I just had a bad experience with the information from that one. Anyways, first off
 Let's hop in the jason jalopy. We're just we're not crossing in the oceans
 We're driving our car it looks like the Beverly hillbilly's car, but we got those spinning rims on it
 So it's like jeet out. We're going to Hannibal, Missouri
 Now down in Hannibal, Missouri
 There is a legend that there used to be this pit or I'm sure it's still there
 It probably doesn't like fall in on itself
 But there is a pit in Hannibal, Missouri, which no one has found
 since this happened
 But it was this bottomless pit and animals kept falling into it
 So I don't know how stupid the animals are down in Missouri
 But anyways animals kept falling into this pit and people are like well golly
 Better find out what's down in that pit now
 That's a bad idea. There's no time frame for this story. I don't know if it took place in 1997 or 1797
 Because if it took place any time past the 1970s, you just throw a camcorder down there attached to a rope obviously and see what you get
 But back then whenever this story took place the guy a guy said you know what I'm gonna do
 I'm gonna tie a rope around my waist and I'm gonna lower myself in
 Yee-haw and he goes down into the pit
 And then at some time later according to the book sometime later his friends show up and they hoist them out
 And here's the exact quote his hair had turned completely white
 And he was wildly insane somebody stop me like I mean
 It's not somebody stop me that that part I made up, but
 The wildly insane it sounds like something you'd put on like a sixth graders t-shirt
 Or like a fourth graders t-shirt totally tubular and wildly insane you pull a man out of a pit
 How do you differentiate they're like man this guy looks insane and someone else goes no no no
 He's wildly insane
 Obviously that story is probably not true for a couple reasons one
 There's no time period given for it the guy who went wildly insane. We don't have his name
 Did he lower himself into the pit?
 With his friends not noticing and they just showed up to you know drink some brews and watch the game and they see a rope
 Leading into this pit
 Was his friend supposed to be there to pull him up and a short time later
 He realized they had went and watched the game without him and totally forgot he was hanging down there
 Such a bizarre story, but anyways he goes wildly insane most likely a fake story
 But it's a legend in Hannibal, Missouri
 Now we're driving hot back in the jason jalopy with a wildly insane guy in the back just
 She's going crazy quoting Deadpool the whole time. We're like, oh my god. This guy's driving me nuts
 We drive up to
 Tacoma, Washington
 And there this time we have a dude's name
 But we still don't have a time period for it and technically we have half a name. His name is johnson
 Now his name his first name may be john his last name son
 But probably not it's probably just johnson. He finds a hole in his yard. He moves into this house
 And he doesn't notice the hole at first, but then one day this dog finds his big old hole
 It's a hole that's about four feet in diameter and it's interesting because we're looking at these legends here
 Think about the story. I just told you about Hannibal, Missouri. That was pretty much all the information
 That was in the book
 That's all the information of the legend and now we're moving to this one. Well, you're gonna find more concrete stuff
 This one we have the size of the hole. It's four foot in diameter
 It has a three foot brick wall around it. So it almost looks like a giant well or medium sized well
 I don't know how big wells normally are
 But there's like a three foot brick wall surrounding it which makes it a little suspicious
 He didn't notice it in the first place, but whatever
 And he looks down. It's this huge pit
 So he wants to figure out what's down there obviously and now I don't think he did it on the first day
 He moved in but one day he's bored. It's Saturday afternoon. He throws a rope down there
 He keeps low night. He didn't toss the coiled rope down there
 He's lowering a rope down there is what I meant to say and all the rope goes down
 And he's holding the end and this does he doesn't feel that he's hit the bottom yet and he's like, hmm
 That's weird. He did he throws 40 feet of rope down there. No bottom now
 That's really probably to me 40 feet doesn't sound that long
 But I guess going straight down it probably is he starts to think it's an abandoned well
 And what are you going to do with an abandoned well? He starts throwing old tires into it
 Just tossing old tires down there just because he has to get rid of them anyways
 I don't know what this guy was doing for a job. Maybe it was like automotive repairman
 Maybe just really like tires. I don't know
 Eventually the hole starts to fill up full of tires, which is what will happen when you throw tires in there
 At a later time he starts talking to his neighbors. He's like, you know, hey, yeah, it's pretty nice area. Isn't it? Yeah
 Hey, he goes. Hey, hey, have you guys know anything of previous owners?
 Never mentioned to me about the big old hole in the backyard and they're like, oh, yeah
 Yeah, that hole they didn't tell you about that
 Johnson's like no, what's going on with that hole? I keep throwing tires in it and they're like, oh my god, don't throw tires in it
 No, I'm just joking. I didn't say that
 Anyways after they gave him a heart attack
 They go no, no, it's throw it's safe to throw tires in there
 But don't throw marble in it because the previous owners kept throwing chunks of marble in there
 Now I'm assuming that they were some sort of like counter maker. Again, I don't think they just really really love chunks of marble
 They kept throwing chunks of marble in there and eventually it filled up and then there was an explosion and it blew out everywhere
 And then they moved away now. I don't think the two events were connected
 But the marble did all shoot out like a shotgun blast and they moved away now at that point if I was Johnson, I'd be thinking uh-oh
 I better start getting some of those tires out of there because I don't want a tire explosion
 But he doesn't he just leaves them in there
 But what he starts to notice is over time he has this pile of tires in the pit and now like you can see the top of the
 Tires, they're higher than the pit
 Over time he starts to see the top of the tire slowly go down
 And after an indeterminate amount of time they don't put it in the article pretty soon
 He couldn't see the top of the tires anymore like the pit was getting smaller and smaller and smaller
 It was just melting or shrinking or falling into something
 And that's all we know. We don't know where he lives. We don't have any other information on the story
 If there ever was a tire explosion, we don't know. We don't know what's going on
 Interesting story again most likely a local legend, but it's interesting to see the comparison one has far more details
 So it's almost automatically more believable. It's very weird. I read the first one
 I was like, well, if I don't know who it is and I don't know when it happened
 Then it's probably not real
 But the second one I still missing some key details like a location and a date
 But it's more believable because the character acts in a more believable way. He goes, oh, it's a big pit
 I wonder what I'm gonna do with it. I'm throw garbage in it
 Not lower myself into it and go wildly insane. It's just kind of interesting how those two things play out
 But when I said bottomless pits when I said I was going to talk about bottomless pits
 I'm sure a good 30 40 of you go up
 He's going to mel's he's going to mel's not mel's diner from happy days. That's dated reference. Did they still even show reruns of that?
 No, anyone who really investigates bottomless pits knows the story
 Of mel waters mel waters
 Is a man who made a phone call
 I don't know why i'm talking like that all of a sudden mel waters is a dude so back in back in
 1997 mel waters called up coast to coast am with art bell
 And told this crazy story over the radio and really sparked a renewed interest in the idea of bottomless pits
 He is the elan musk of the bottomless pits
 He is the guy who really like got everyone to think. Whoa, this could actually be something
 We're going to ellensburg washington. So very very. I don't know if it's near actually
 It's in the same state as the coma. We're still in washington
 I probably should have looked it up on google maps
 But anyways, we're in ellensburg washington and you have a man named mel waters
 And what he did was he found a bottomless pit
 He found a big they can't say that it's bottomless until they started testing it
 But he notices this giant pit in his property. It also has like a little bit of a wall
 I think his wall was made of metal just a small like wall
 And his first thing is he starts throwing garbage in it, which again is a normal thing
 And now you see again the difference. We have dates now. We have a full name and stuff like that
 He starts throwing garbage into the pit
 And starts to get curious about it and
 Can't see how deep it is. He takes a pack of lifesavers wraps a string around it lowers it figuring if it hits water
 He'll pull it up and the lifesavers will be dissolved nothing. So he's doing these scientific tests
 Eventually, he's able to get 80,000 feet
 of fishing lure
 string
 Fishing string that's what it's called right fishing line fishing line. I never I'm not an outdoors dude at all
 Anyways, he's puts down 80,000 feet of fishing lure dammit a fishing line
 And doesn't hit bottom doesn't hit bottom
 Now people are going away a second this story is okay. Let me finish. Let me finish. He doesn't hit bottom
 So now he's like truly
 Truly, this is a bottomless pit
 He keeps throwing junk in it can't figure it out keeps throwing junk in it
 But then he knows these dudes his friends of his these friends of his are basque sheep herders
 So rock on basque brothers his basque sheep herders
 Are hanging out with him and he's telling them about this hole and they said well
 You know if you really want to test this hole we got a test for you. So they take a sheep
 This is okay
 So let before I get into the sheep story that was a little bit of a teaser because then it gets really bizarre
 Let's talk about the fishing fishing line
 um 80,000 feet of fishing line is obviously a lot
 Of fishing line. I mean that must have cost him quite a lot of money to get that much unless he's a true scavenger
 and just like rifling through fishermen stuff
 80,000 feet is a ton but
 I that's what I thought when I read that I was like there's no way any human could collect 80,000 feet of fishing line if
 Unless they worked at a fishing line company and they were like stealing it like Johnny Cash. So
 That was my logic
 But there was a geologist who said there is no and this is a little more scientifically
 Possible than my just like you can't own it. That's impossible. This geologist said
 fishing line
 Drop to 80,000 feet into the earth would melt
 It would just melt because it's just too hot down there. It's not saying the hot lava is down there
 But the temperature 80,000 feet down is way too hot
 It's impossible the the heat of the planet would just burn the string
 And also you'd wonder how does he know that it doesn't hit the ground to just start piling up
 But let's give him the benefit of the doubt here for a second
 Because assuming the hole is actually that deep at a certain point. It's like not into the earth anymore
 It's like almost a portal into something else a a basically a gateway
 It's less a bottomless pit carved into the planet and more of a really really deep pit that opens to some sort of abyss
 Which is actually where the term bottomless pit comes from so
 That aside the geological pressures and stuff aside because we're getting into the weird stuff now
 He's back. He's hanging out with the bass sheep herders. They take a sheep and they put it into a crate
 And they begin lowering it into the bottomless pit and the whole time they should
 They hear it getting less and less as they're lowering it down
 They lower it down about 1500 feet and then all of a sudden they hear it and the the ropes start shaking violently
 They hear it running around in the crate and screaming and then nothing
 The lamb goes silent. You're pulling this
 Sheep up this lamb slash sheep
 Up to the top of I do in this with my hand motion for some reason like i'm pulling a rope
 They pull it to the top of the pit
 And the sheep is dead
 So they do see it's dead and they do a field autopsy on it. They cut it open and it's all of its organs have turned to like this gelatinous
 tumor
 And they're like, oh that's disgusting. No one's eating lamb chops tonight
 and so
 They pull it out
 And they see that the tumor is moving and the one dude goes
 I'm gonna cut it open. I'm gonna see what's in that the other guys are like, no, no, no, don't don't don't and he does
 He cuts it open and what is described as
 a tumor seal
 Just falls out still attached with an umbilical cord
 To something to the basically the mama tumor inside the sheep
 So it's basically it looks like a seal
 But it kind of also looks like a giant tumor just like a growth
 With hauntingly human like eyes is how it's described
 And according to this website that i was reading
 It says that the seal the tumor seal looked at the sheep herders and mel
 And the sheep herders looked at the tumor seal
 silently
 For two hours at a certain point someone's going to be like you guys are seeing that right like I would say that after the first 30 seconds
 But apparently for two hours everyone just kind of looked at each other
 And then after two hours the tumor the tumor seal nodded to the men and jumped into the pit
 And they're like what in tarnation was that and mel's water's just like I don't know wait
 Wait wait a second
 I used to have esophagus cancer and now it's in remission
 He felt the tumors in his own body disappear going to remission. So bizarre
 yes
 It's weirder because the tumor seal keeps showing up after that he pops back out of the pits. He's like
 I'm back folks. He's doing a little dance like the frog from Warner Brothers
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
 Ta-da-da-da has a little top hat now and a cane he shows up just all the time it starts visiting the sheep herders be like what are you guys doing?
 Can I play rummy? Yeah, I'm really good at this here. Let me deal. He ended and he's
 Playing with the cards
 He can also well he can't talk to them, but only veam shortwave radio
 So he's like down there on a ham radio
 His name is to me. Hey, it's to me coming from the hole. How are you guys doing up there?
 And they're like god damn it too. Well, this guy stopped calling me. Hey, to me. What's up?
 He can talk to him via shortwave radio
 I mean come on. So we're gonna get into how the story evolved in a second. He can talk to them via radio, but
 Unfortunately for us whenever they tried recording his voice. It just came out as static
 But if we were there, we would have been able to understand what to me was saying
 Eventually though people always go were mel. Where's this hole at?
 Like seriously, I can get cured of my cancer. I can throw garbage down there
 I might even be able to be harassed on various occasions by a talking tumor and he goes well
 I can't tell you where it's at because this is kind of the conclusion to the story
 The federal government found out about the hole and they either scared him off their property and took the place over
 Or they bought it from him or both right now
 Well as of really his last communication mel said he was living on australia
 On the federal government's dime. They basically paid him off but told him if they didn't take the deal
 They were going to find a drug lab on his property
 And that place is now owned by the u.s. Military which that pattern does fit
 Other weird locations we found when I did that death valley episode all these weird underground spots are all now owned by the government
 And they're totally off limits to civilians
 But it's a very convenient answer as well. So let's start getting into the nitty gritty here
 We're running a little long, but let's get in the nitty gritty here because I just can't leave you with that
 There's never been anyone
 Oh something that a lot of skeptics go is they say mel waters never existed. There's no record that he lived in that area
 However, he could be using a fake name. I'm not going to totally hang my hat on the fact like well
 There wasn't a guy named mel waters up there
 Then the whole story is fake
 Like I'm not going to hang but I think there's other stuff that proves that the story is kind of ridiculous other than that
 Using a fake name is not
 Musicians use fake names. Like that's just kind of a normal thing
 There's other interesting
 Things that are about this one. They are used to be a file on all the mel water stories at
 A local library that files gone and people have pointed to that being some sort of conspiracy
 Although other people could say it could just been a patron who took that
 People are still looking for mel's hole today. I don't know if mel is still alive
 And if it's a fake name, we never really would know if he was alive
 People believe they've narrowed down kind of the area where the hole could be but since they don't know
 Who the person was who really made the phone call to art bell
 Or owned the property or anything like that. They can't look through property records
 So people are still looking for this hole and everyone else is saying your guys are idiots because it doesn't exist
 It's physically impossible
 And I think they're half right a bottomless hole cannot exist
 That goes all the way through the earth just the pressure of the earth would collapse a hole at any given point
 So what you can have though, where's it going to get, you know paranormal here
 You could have a deep hole
 Or it really anything that enters into
 Some other realm
 So it doesn't even have to be a bottomless pit you could look at the pit and it could only be three feet deep
 But when you throw a penny in there, you just see the penny disappear into the ground
 Obviously science disagrees with me on that
 But I mean when you're looking at the paranormal and the supernatural that's possible
 You could come home from work today
 Walk through your bedroom door
 And end up in raven dale some magical forest full of pixies and a dark overlord trying to take stuff over in a supernatural world
 It's incredibly
 Small chance at whatever happened, but in a world where you believe in the paranormal and supernatural it's possible
 So make sure that you're really good with your bow and arrow skills before you go home
 But if you were able to have a static place you could have these weird time slips and portals moving around
 But if there was actually a hole
 That you were able to go into and enter into this other realm
 And that's why it seems bottomless. There's some other fantasy realm
 That is just full of couches broken down tv sets in tires and they're like why god
 Why are you punishing us as another tire comes rolling crushing their village?
 But I think that's the really the only workable way you could have a bottomless pit as described in these stories
 Because really that's only the interesting way if someone goes I found a bottomless pit
 You're like really and they're like look I can look all the way through the planet earth. You'd be like, yeah, it's kind of cool
 But that's not necessarily interesting
 I want a bottomless pit that leads somewhere not just a pit that just goes
 To the molten core of the planet big whoop. Yeah
 Like that's to me is just a big old hole in the ground
 I would want a bottomless pit that was truly bottomless like you could throw stuff in forever and it would never fill up
 And then that's a paranormal thing
 Otherwise you're just throwing couches through and they're getting melted in hot lava
 And that's really not bottomless the bottomless part the bottom part is just the other side of the planet
 So if we take that scenario I took a little long time to get to this point
 This is my point if we take that scenario that could be moved
 That could be moved
 If you if you were able to identify that here is a hole
 And in this hole is a static gateway to another realm
 We can either do one or two things we can put a government or a military presence on this hole
 And it would be super bizarre because we're in this little part of washington all of a sudden this military base springs up out of nowhere
 And maybe there was one there for a time
 But it seems like the first thing they would want to do is
 Can we move it?
 Can we move this hole?
 We want to put it somewhere else
 If we dig this hole up
 Will the unusual qualities remain as scientists are like, I don't know you got 8 000 feet of fishing line and they're like, yeah it's over there
 You figure out how deep
 The actual earth pit is and where it opens up into something else
 And the thing is is you could say well, we could dig it up and we could retain its properties
 Or we could dig it up and then it's just a bunch of dirt is the risk versus the reward
 And if this agency or this government says it is
 It's absolutely where we don't want it here. We want to be able to access this on a regular basis without bringing trucks in
 Let's move it
 so
 Going on that thought mel's hole. I believe if it's real at all
 Which i'm highly doubtful of
 But if it's real at all
 It isn't there anymore
 They would have found it by now people have said that they've seen it before
 The story actually I forgot to mention the stories of this bottomless pit existed before the phone call
 That mel made and some people go no, it was just a really really deep pit. It wasn't really bottomless
 But whether or not it's like this portal where you can throw sheep down and then talking tumors pop out
 I don't know people have said the dogs have come back to life being thrown in there
 People have said black beams have shot out of there or radios will play really old music when you walk by which I think they just have
 the oldie station on but
 There's lots of other weird phenomenon. So it would be something that the military would or a government agency or a
 secret society would want control of
 But not there
 They'd want to move it
 there could be a place
 outside of the view of
 us of normal people
 that
 all of these items all of these things
 are stored
 And you go isn't that the plot of like indiana jones isn't that the plot of that show warehouse 13 predictive programming maybe?
 predictive programming
 No, I think I honestly believe that if any of this stuff is real if any of this stuff is provable whether it's walking mannequins or bottomless pits
 Somebody wants to own and contain those and study them and more importantly use them
 Because why not?
 The one thing we forget a lot of times
 Is that governments and secret societies and secret agencies?
 And it's mad scientists are people. They're us. They are us. They just have more
 access to the paths of power or money or technology, but they're us
 If you found a bottomless pit
 You would start throwing junk into it if the illuminati had access to a pit
 They're going to start throwing junk into it. It's just human curiosity to want to do these things
 But after you got tired after you got bored of throwing your eight television set down there and never hearing it smash
 You're going to think
 If I can throw stuff down there
 Can stuff from down there come up?
 But see that's where we differ from these other groups
 We can just think about it or lower a sheep down 1500 feet
 If you are a governmental agency or a secret society
 You have the resources
 to find out
 100 percent
 What's on the other side of that portal?
 You have the power to 100 find out what's on the other side of that portal
 The question is
 What will they bring back up?
