1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Did you know that Japanese samurai love to play Bloody Mary?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,500
 Then we travel to Kirtland, Ohio, a town that was personally cursed by Joseph Smith.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,080
 Whether or not you believe in the curse is up to you, but everyone has to agree that the

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
 day the red fog rolled into town, evil came with it.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
 I'm a little sleepy, so I'm drinking a Diet Pepsi.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
 I get two of these a day.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,720
 Probably should drink it before I record my cast for this life.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,000
 And you know what's also life?

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
 You know who else is living?

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
 One of our legacy Patreons, I hope he's still alive, Hunter McCarthy.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,880
 Everyone give a round of applause to Hunter McCarthy.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 He's alive.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
 He's showing that his heart is beating.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
 He's pulling in an X-ray machine and sonograms and stuff like that.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,640
 I'm running out of ways to introduce you guys.

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,160
 Hunter, you're going to be Avatar Alive.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,440
 Hunter, you're our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,080
 If you can't afford to Patreon, I totally understand.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,160
 Just help spread the word about the show.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,640
 Really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
 Hunter, I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
 You're going to take a little journey across the Pacific Ocean.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,080
 We are headed out to ancient Japan.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,720
 So we're rowing on out.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,480
 Hunter is standing on the bow like George Washington.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,360
 So this first story is actually a recommendation from a long time listener of the show, Fabio.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,560
 He sent a ton of stuff to the show, so really, really appreciated Fabio.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,480
 So when we get to the shores of Japan, it's old timey Japan.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
 And we're all wearing like awesome samurai garbs.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
 So we're like the plated armor and we got like the katana and the little knife and

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
 we're like looking out for ninjas and stuff like that.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,400
 We don't see any ninjas, but we're kind of disappointed in that because we really wanted

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 to see a ninja.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,640
 We're like, yeah, sure, we're a samurai and all, but you know, ninjas are way cooler.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,360
 We're being led into this big house.

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,600
 There's this other samurai guy.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,080
 He's like, hey guys, come over here.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
 You're from the tour group.

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,840
 Tour groups haven't been invented yet, because it's like 1599 AD.

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
 Come on over here, guys.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,400
 He leads us into this spooky house and it has three rooms.

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
 It might have more than that.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,120
 It might not just be built for this.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,000
 It might have 10 rooms, but we're only going to use three rooms.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,440
 What we're about to engage in is the practice known as Hayukmonigatari kai dekankai.

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
 That's exactly how you pronounce it.

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,160
 Don't double check that.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
 Do not put that into Google Frantiation.

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 I got it right.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,760
 This was an old game that actually started off with the samurai class in old timey Japan.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,720
 We actually, the earliest reference people can find of it is in 1660.

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,000
 The idea was this.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,480
 And this is a game you can play at home as well.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,240
 If you're a samurai, or even if you're not a samurai, what you do is you have three rooms.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,040
 The first room you gather there with your friends.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,960
 You get as many friends as you want who want to engage in this.

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 Pre or post COVID.

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,880
 You might not want to do it right now.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,680
 You have a bunch of people in one room.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,440
 And then the second room, you have nothing.

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,840
 And then in the third room, you have 100 candles.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,880
 I should also say this game is not safe to play on many levels.

68
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,600
 The first one being unattended flame.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,080
 Unattended 100 candles.

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,360
 You have three rooms.

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,400
 So the samurai would all sit in the first room and they'd be like, dude, you want to

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
 hear a scary story and everyone turns and he goes once upon a time.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 That's a fairy tale.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And if people were like, oh no, how are they ever get ruffles, still skins gold?

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,680
 No, they would say the scary stories were totally ruined the immersion.

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,720
 But the scary stories, the samurai would sit there and go once upon a time.

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,000
 Damn it, not once upon a time.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,320
 The samurai would go, hey guys, this is what happened.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,840
 Once there was this villager who was like walking through the woods and then like a

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,800
 goblin bit him.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
 People were like, oh, that's really spooky.

82
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,120
 Rolling their eyes, they're like, I always let that guy start because they always tell

83
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
 the name of stories.

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,600
 And then the storyteller, whoever told the first scary story.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,640
 Oh, I should say this too.

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,440
 This has to take, I forgot this detail.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,120
 This episode is starting to get off to a great start.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,840
 You have to wait till the darkest part of night.

89
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,440
 So you can't be doing this at 3 in the afternoon.

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
 So it's like 2 in the morning.

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
 I guess I should have started out.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,520
 Spooky 2 in the morning.

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
 There's an owl screeching.

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,720
 Are there owls in Japan?

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,560
 There's one now screeching.

96
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,560
 The wind.

97
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 Wooden shoes.

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,960
 Clock, clock, clock, clock on whatever Japanese house floors are made out of.

99
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
 I'm going to assume wood, but their walls are made of paper.

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
 So I really shouldn't assume anything.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,920
 Lop, lop, lop.

102
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
 Where was I going?

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
 Oh yeah.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,920
 Now it's become architectural digest podcast.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,440
 You have, the samurai tells a scary story.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,560
 And everyone goes, oh man that was super scary.

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 And then the samurai who tells the first scary story.

108
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
 It's the darkest time of night.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
 It has to leave the room with his fellow samurai.

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,600
 Walk through the empty room.

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,160
 Get to the room, damn it I forgot another detail.

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,040
 They're going to get to the room with the candles.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 And in the room with the candles, I left this part out too.

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,640
 There's a mirror on a table.

115
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,560
 So you have a third room with a mirror on a table, 100 candles.

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,440
 Samurai who tells a scary story walks through the empty room into the room with all the

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,320
 candles, has to snuff out a candle and then stare into the mirror for a bit.

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,720
 There's no specified time period, but it's more than just a glance.

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,320
 Then he walks back through the empty room to rejoin his fellow soldiers.

120
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 So you can see where this is going.

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,160
 This is actually a really interesting idea.

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
 When they played this game it was a test of bravery because as the night wore on you have

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
 to tell 100 stories, not one person.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,240
 Each person tells a different story.

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,360
 And it has to be a true story of something that they encountered that was paranormal or

126
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,320
 grim, very dark story.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
 Or a story that they had gathered from their countrymen.

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,600
 They're like killing peasants and the peasants are like "Oh, here's a scary story for you

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,920
 the time you showed up and murdered my family."

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,520
 Samurai's like "Haha, I can't wait to tell that story later chop."

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,440
 The samurais are going out when they're not oppressing the people and when they're not

132
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,040
 oppressing the peasantry.

133
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,480
 They're gathering spooky stories.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,720
 So if you would go and they would snuff out the candle, so as the night progressed the

135
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,040
 room would get darker and darker and you'd have to look in that mirror.

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,680
 And we all know it's kind of a scientific fact that if you look in a mirror in low light

137
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,120
 it will cause hallucinations.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,120
 By the time you get to like story 80 you're super spooked out to even walk through that

139
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
 second room.

140
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,280
 See that second room is supposed to be a passageway between the living and the damned.

141
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,360
 The room of the lights and the candles are slowly going out.

142
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,120
 And the stories get progressively scarier or they just kind of start to weigh on your

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
 conscience.

144
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,360
 The last 20 stories might not have been that scary, but story 67, oh that didn't sit well

145
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
 with you.

146
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
 You're still thinking about that one.

147
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,840
 The storyteller is the one who always has to go put out the candle.

148
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,040
 They said most of these games ended at story 99.

149
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,480
 Because people were too scared to tell that last story.

150
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,800
 It was considered a test of bravery among the samurai class.

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
 In 1660 there was a nursery story written about this.

152
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,760
 The tradition had already existed, but that's when it went mainstream.

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,720
 There was a nursery story and the samurai, the last samurai who was walking through the

154
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,040
 house, he saw like a spooky hand coming at him in the light of the last candle and he

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
 turned around with his samurai sword.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,640
 That's why you shouldn't play these games with people who are fully armed and most likely

157
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,140
 have PTSD.

158
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,640
 He sees this spooky hand coming at him from the darkness and he swings around with his

159
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,160
 samurai sword to cut the hand off and it was a spider.

160
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,560
 He didn't cut the spider, he cut the webbing and then I don't know fell in the flame and

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
 burned up.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
 I added that last detail, but it would be cool.

163
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,160
 So that was like a story you would tell little kids to make them not afraid.

164
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,480
 Not afraid of playing a game that samurai are playing.

165
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,600
 They're like "Now I told you Billy, don't play that game that you didn't know existed

166
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
 until you read the story."

167
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 They're like "What?"

168
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,800
 It's a weird warning.

169
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,600
 But because it became super popular it actually drifted down to the lower classes and they

170
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
 began playing it.

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,880
 The popular, because you had to come up with these stories, people started to scour the

172
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,800
 land looking for the scariest stories to tell.

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,760
 Eventually there was a book published.

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
 There's a little bit of a...

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,200
 Oh and to be fair, I'm looking at my notes, they didn't use candles, they used andons

176
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,080
 because I'm sure I would have gotten several comments on that.

177
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,860
 It's a Japanese light, but it's basically a candle in a paper box.

178
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,040
 So in 1677 there was actually a book published called "100 Tales of Many Countries" and

179
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,360
 these were stories that had been gathered around the world, spooky tales, to scare people.

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,440
 People couldn't find enough stories to tell so they had to start selling books, supplements

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,000
 like D&D supplements to take care of it.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,200
 You can play this game today, I've seen variations of it where you can do it in one room.

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,240
 No, you would need two rooms at least.

184
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,080
 You need to have one room and you don't need the second room with the passageway.

185
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,640
 They said you can do it with one room.

186
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,280
 I guess you could do it with one room and just the candles in that room.

187
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,680
 Whether or not it's one room, ten rooms, three rooms, the traditional three rooms, you can

188
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
 play this game.

189
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,520
 The problem is, is I was not able to find any cleansing ritual for it.

190
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,120
 Any sort of ritual you're doing like that where you're playing with fire, literally,

191
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
 and that's why I say that's the other problem wrong with it.

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,400
 One is you actually have open flame, unattended open flame, but the other one is you're kind

193
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,320
 of, you're telling these creepy stories, you're moving through a passageway, you're going

194
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,240
 to a room where there's no life, there's a mirror that you're going to stare into, the

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,480
 light level is dropping, you're invoking things.

196
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,200
 You're invoking, you're doing a ritual that's trying to invoke something.

197
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,960
 Whether it's just fear, human fear, or something even darker than that, there's no banishing

198
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,440
 ritual, there's no cleansing ritual, so it seems fairly dangerous from a metaphysical

199
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,920
 aspect and then just from a regular physical aspect with all the unattended flame.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,080
 But it is a game you can play if you're willing to take both of those risks.

201
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
 Try it.

202
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,480
 I think also you might want to pare down the stories.

203
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,440
 Hundred stories is a lot, because you know you're going to get that one guy who starts

204
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,680
 describing that novel he's been writing since junior high.

205
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
 He's like, first off, let me describe the world.

206
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,160
 Let me do the world building.

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,080
 He's like, the unicorns and the vampires have been at war for a thousand years before the

208
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
 story.

209
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,600
 You're like, is it spooky?

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
 He's like, yeah, yeah, kind of.

211
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,280
 So maybe cut it down to like 50 stories or 20?

212
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,120
 The less stories you have, the less candles you have, so it's safer that way.

213
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,920
 But if you feel like playing it, there you go.

214
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,040
 The samurai did it.

215
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
 And you could do it too.

216
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,720
 I don't recommend doing it.

217
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,640
 I don't recommend doing it in a paper house.

218
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,520
 But if you feel like you wanted to invoke a dark spirit by telling spooky stories, there

219
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
 you go.

220
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,080
 Hunter, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

221
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,200
 We're leaving behind Japan before the spooky spooky ghosts crawl out of the mirror.

222
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,400
 We are headed out to Kirtland, Ohio.

223
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:52,040
 There's a black hair coming from the back of the car.

224
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:59,080
 And I'm just sitting there in a white dress and black hair is covering my face.

225
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
 And you're waiting for a jump scare, but there's not.

226
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,320
 It just got cursed by a ghost down there.

227
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,120
 I turn around and I'm like, yeah, I guess I'm a 13 year old girl for the rest of this

228
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
 episode.

229
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,520
 I am a, what are they called?

230
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
 A yokai?

231
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,720
 I looked in the mirror too long.

232
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 I told 101 stories of Roku, so this is how I am for the rest of the episode.

233
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
 But that doesn't matter.

234
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 That doesn't matter because I can still tell this story, although I probably will start

235
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,160
 killing people at some point.

236
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,880
 This was actually recommended to me by Brew via Gmail.

237
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
 He's been sending me a bunch of stuff lately.

238
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,760
 Thank you very much for the recommendation, Brew.

239
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,920
 Very, very interesting story.

240
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,520
 Now we've been to Kirtland, Ohio before.

241
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,600
 A long time ago, most of you guys may not remember, longtime listeners of the show should

242
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,680
 remember it as the home of the melon heads.

243
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
 Just monster people of little dudes of big melon heads.

244
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,480
 They were supposed to be the scientific experiment.

245
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,120
 There's different origin stories for them, but Hunter, fly the carbonic copter over those

246
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,400
 melon heads they're chasing us.

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
 They're not going to catch up to us.

248
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,400
 We're specifically going to Kirtland, Ohio.

249
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,280
 The year is 1831.

250
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,400
 We all hop out of the carbonic copter.

251
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,440
 And as we're getting out there, we see like wagons, old timey wagons.

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,080
 There's no other kind of wagon.

253
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
 There's no new timey wagon.

254
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,000
 There's wagons and horses and stuff like that.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,520
 And we see a man and he jumps off the wagon and he goes, "Everybody, dudes, this is Zion."

256
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
 And everyone starts clapping.

257
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,160
 And we're just like standing there like, "What?"

258
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,880
 And I tap me on the shoulder and I'm like, "That man is Joseph Smith."

259
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,560
 And you're like, "I'm okay.

260
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
 It's so weird."

261
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,960
 They just jumped off and declared this place as Zion.

262
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,120
 Zion is the, trying to think of a way to sum it up, it's basically the holy city or the

263
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,720
 promised land that will be rebuilt in Christianity.

264
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,840
 Also if you're not a big fan of Christian faith, it's from the Matrix.

265
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,360
 So either one.

266
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
 It's supposed to be this promised land.

267
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,800
 And in Latter-day Saint Faith, the promised land is supposed to be in the United States.

268
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 So when Joseph Smith, 1831, he had just really got the Mormon church started up.

269
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,080
 And they had left New York, they had come to Kirtland, Ohio, and he goes, "This is it,

270
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
 guys.

271
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 This is it.

272
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,040
 This is the place we're all going to chill on."

273
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 Maybe he actually didn't declare it as Zion.

274
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
 Actually, I'm looking at my notes.

275
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
 He just said it was a really dope town.

276
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,400
 He might not have declared it as Zion.

277
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,160
 I actually think he said Zion was in Mississippi somewhere.

278
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,760
 I used to, I never was a follower of the Latter-day Saints, but I dated a lot of Mormon girls,

279
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,480
 so I used to know more about that stuff.

280
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,160
 You know, just to get a date.

281
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,840
 But anyways, that doesn't matter.

282
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
 This is actually, this is a very important part to Latter-day Saint tradition, because

283
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,840
 this is where the very first temple was built.

284
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,680
 On 1836, they held the dedication for this temple, and Joseph Smith goes, "Here it is.

285
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
 This is Zion."

286
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
 And the guy's like, "No, no, that's the other place."

287
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,480
 He goes, "Oh, I'm sorry.

288
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,560
 This is just a really cool city."

289
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,560
 And then pillars of fire appeared in the sky, some Samurais were playing that game of on

290
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
 a cloud.

291
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
 Pillars of fire appeared in the sky.

292
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 People started flying around.

293
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
 A bunch of people who were there to watch the dedication of the church, that's all they

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 came out to see, but they get to see angels and fire.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
 This is way better.

296
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,040
 This is way better than the church dedication.

297
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,800
 But what happens is, and this happens very common with religions, especially new religions.

298
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,040
 They get persecuted.

299
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
 People don't understand what it is.

300
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,120
 The stuff seems too wacky.

301
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,320
 The beliefs seem too far out of there.

302
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
 Or they seem heresy.

303
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
 I think I'm downplaying it.

304
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,880
 They seem like they're outright heresy.

305
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,520
 So in this church, the Mormons were persecuted.

306
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,600
 The city actually began to take the Mormon's property and then expelled them to the outskirts

307
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,840
 of town to a place called Pinotentiary Glen, which was actually just a giant ditch.

308
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
 They did it during the winter time.

309
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,840
 A bunch of the Mormons died.

310
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
 They had no shelter.

311
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,000
 They couldn't stay warm.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 They froze to death.

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,680
 Joseph Smith says we gotta leave, because this town's obviously not accepting of us.

314
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,560
 They did murder a bunch of us by making us sleep in the cold.

315
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,200
 So he packs up his followers and they leave town.

316
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,640
 But as he's leaving town, he actually places a curse on Kirtland, Ohio.

317
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,200
 This was the place he was supposed to...

318
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,680
 His first temple was built here.

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,440
 This is where he was supposed to rule from on high and spread the word of the Latter-day

320
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
 Saints.

321
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,640
 He's like, "We're out, guys.

322
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,120
 We're leaving this town.

323
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 We're out, and we built that really cool church.

324
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
 Let's get rid of it."

325
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,920
 So we're not gonna let anyone else use it.

326
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,480
 So they go to set it on fire before they leave.

327
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,280
 And the church won't burn, no matter how hard they try.

328
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,080
 I don't know how hard they try.

329
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,680
 Joseph Smith's just kind of singeing the corner of it.

330
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 He's like, "Oh, no.

331
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
 It won't burn.

332
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 Oh, well."

333
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,880
 They're trying to burn the church down, burn down the temple.

334
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,960
 But all of the flames are going...

335
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,360
 All the flames, like everything they set on fire, is blowing away and it lands on a Methodist

336
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
 church next door, torches it.

337
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,240
 It literally burns into the ground.

338
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,400
 At that point, Joseph Smith's like, "Okay, we gotta leave."

339
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,920
 I'm like, "Okay, we're done."

340
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,120
 But there's still a curse on this town.

341
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,980
 Now that curse story has been around for decades, or really a century at this point.

342
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,440
 People in the town still think that it's cursed.

343
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 It's a very small town.

344
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,400
 It has a population of about 7,000 people.

345
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
 But you'll see reports of ghost stories, weird crimes.

346
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,200
 Some kids were skinny dipping, and this woman goes, "Stop skinny dipping!"

347
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
 And their kids are like, "What are you gonna do about it?"

348
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,520
 She threw dynamite into the lake.

349
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,800
 I mean, it's basically like Derry from the It novel.

350
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,040
 There's just a bunch of weird people there.

351
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,360
 Sorry, Curt Lindo, Ohio listeners.

352
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,640
 But you guys know what I'm talking about.

353
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
 All of those were just weird anecdotes.

354
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,080
 People heard about this curse.

355
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,000
 The Mormon Church actually has moved back in.

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,960
 There's like four different denominations in the area.

357
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,320
 It's a thriving center, because that is their first temple.

358
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,840
 They were able to kind of reclaim that land.

359
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,160
 But whether or not you believe in the curse, you knew something was different the day that

360
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,720
 the red fog rolled into town.

361
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,200
 There's a lot of different sects of the Latter-day Saints.

362
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,360
 One of them is the reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

363
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,680
 And in the 1980s, there was a man named Jeffrey Lundgren.

364
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
 He was a member of that church.

365
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,360
 And it's a more liberal, has a more liberal view of the text.

366
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,320
 So they allow women ministers.

367
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,360
 They preach about gay rights and things like that.

368
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,320
 So that's going to cause a little bit of an issue with some of the people who are more

369
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
 conservative in the church.

370
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,400
 And that's just the nature of everything.

371
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,520
 And that was Jeffrey Lundgren.

372
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,800
 He was actually had a more conservative view of how the church should be run.

373
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,640
 But for now, he's a member of the RLDS.

374
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,680
 And he actually works at the Kirtland Temple, that original temple.

375
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,280
 Now it's run by the RLDS.

376
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
 And he does tours through the temple.

377
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,680
 I don't know how big the temple is.

378
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
 He's just like, "Here's a room.

379
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
 Okay, we're done.

380
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
 Here's a view."

381
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,120
 But anyways, he gives tours and he also teaches Bible study classes.

382
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,640
 So even though he doesn't agree with everything, he agrees with most of it.

383
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,680
 And it's a job.

384
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,400
 And it's a way for him to find like souls.

385
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 Because not everyone agrees with these new views of the RLDS.

386
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
 So during his Bible study classes, he's actually kind of talking to people and he's like, "Hey,

387
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,520
 yeah, that's stuff they're talking about.

388
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
 It's cool and all.

389
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,080
 You know, I have a different interpretation."

390
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 People go, "Oh, that's interesting.

391
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,040
 I'm just on the tour group, but tell me your interpretation."

392
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,080
 He also, because that's just one thing and that's fine freedom of speech, he also began

393
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 embezzling money.

394
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
 There's no such thing as freedom of money.

395
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,280
 You don't have the right to just take other people's money.

396
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:48,320
 The Kirtland church finds out that he embezzled between $25,000 to $40,000.

397
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,720
 So they're like, "We should have caught you.

398
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 We should have caught you at the $25,000."

399
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
 But we didn't.

400
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 You might have had $40,000.

401
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 They fire him.

402
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 He's like, "Fine, whatever.

403
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 Your church is kind of lame."

404
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,240
 And I got like 20 people to come with me.

405
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,080
 1987 now.

406
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,720
 This is where we get classic cult behavior.

407
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,080
 This is where we get classic cult behavior.

408
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
 This is just like the Ant Hill kids.

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
 This is like Jonestown.

410
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,640
 Him and his followers rent this large farmhouse.

411
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
 And almost all of them live in it.

412
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,280
 There's about 20 people living in the farmhouse.

413
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
 They got this big barn, probably a couple of cows and chickens running around.

414
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,720
 One of the things is you have to give the money to Jeffrey.

415
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
 Very, very common thing.

416
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,680
 You go out, you work, but you sign your paychecks over to Jeffrey Lundgren.

417
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,880
 You also got to call him "Dad," which is just weird.

418
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 Everyone's doing this.

419
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
 Everyone's following the program except for one family.

420
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,920
 But they're pretty devout, so Jeffrey kind of lets it slide.

421
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,040
 They don't live at the farmhouse and they're not giving him all of their money.

422
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,600
 Because you have this member named Dennis Avery and he goes, "Listen, I got three kids.

423
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,880
 I'm going to give you a bunch of my money, but I can't give you all of it."

424
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,720
 And he sold his house.

425
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,560
 I think he lived in Mississippi or Missouri.

426
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,280
 He sold his house to move to Ohio to be a part of this church, to be a part of Jeffrey's

427
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,080
 church.

428
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,640
 And he kept some of the money for himself.

429
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,920
 So Jeffrey was a little suspicious of Dennis.

430
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 But what are you going to do?

431
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
 You're running a cult.

432
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 You're a busy man.

433
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
 You're going to be a priest.

434
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
 You're going to be a priest.

435
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
 You're going to be a priest.

436
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
 You're going to be a priest.

437
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
 You're going to be a priest.

438
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
 You're going to be a priest.

439
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 You're going to be a priest.

440
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
 You're going to be a priest.

441
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 You're going to be a priest.

442
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 You're going to be a priest.

443
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
 You're going to be a priest.

444
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
 You're going to be a priest.

445
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 You're going to be a priest.

446
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
 You're going to be a priest.

447
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
 You're going to be a priest.

448
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
 You're going to be a priest.

449
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
 You're going to be a priest.

450
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 You're going to be a priest.

451
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
 You're going to be a priest.

452
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,920
 You're going to be a priest.

453
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 You're going to be a priest.

454
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
 You're going to be a priest.

455
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 So he's saying that stuff and then he begins predicting.

456
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
 This is kind of badass honestly.

457
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,920
 But he begins predicting on May 15th 1988.

458
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,920
 Demons would show up running around.

459
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
 They're going to attack the world.

460
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 And the only way that we can help fight them off is that we have to attack, not them, not

461
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 fight the hell mouth in Sunnydale.

462
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,920
 Jeffrey Lundgren and his 20 followers have to arm themselves of course and attack and

463
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
 take over the Kirtland Temple.

464
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 So I honestly got to say I don't think he probably, he probably did have these visions,

465
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
 but I think he really just wanted to get back at his employer for that one.

466
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,920
 But maybe he saw it as the pinnacle of all earthy religion.

467
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 It was the first Mormon temple.

468
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
 That's what he wants to do.

469
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,920
 Now around the same time, this is very one of those interesting stories because fate,

470
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,920
 law enforcement and tragedy keep intersecting each other around the same time.

471
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,920
 Before May 15th, you see they have to do this before May 15th attack the temple.

472
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 The police start getting tips that hey people keep shooting guns off at the Lundgren farm.

473
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
 And yeah it's a farming community, people shoot off guns all the time,

474
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:57,920
 but it's not like a "pfft" it's like a "bada-da-da-da-da". It's like you're watching some World War 2 movie.

475
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
 They're just constantly shooting off rounds.

476
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 So the police go and talk to him and they're like "hey, Jeffrey. Are you running a cult?

477
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
 Are you running a fully armed and operational cult out here?

478
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 What? Me? No way dude."

479
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
 He's like kicking the guns away with his foot and they're going off as he's kicking them.

480
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 He's like "no, not me. Those are other weird noises. I ate some bullets for breakfast."

481
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,920
 The cops leave and so he gets scared. He realizes "okay, they're on to us.

482
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,920
 We can't actually lead an armed attack against this church now."

483
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 So that actually prevented that assault. So that was early in 1988.

484
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,920
 But then we're coming up to October 10th, 1988.

485
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 And at this point like people are fully aware that he's running a cult.

486
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 Whether or not he's arming these guys to do anything crazy,

487
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,920
 all the talk in town is that this guy is bad news.

488
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 So he's actually excommunicated from the RLDS church.

489
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 He was still like a member of that church.

490
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
 I don't think he was going and singing hymns the whole time.

491
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 As he was scoping out, he's like "oh dude, I can totally break through that window.

492
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
 I have this guy throw a grenade through here."

493
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
 I think he was a member in spirit.

494
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 But that was the day they excommunicated him from that church.

495
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 Now his religion had this belief. You do see this belief in other Mormon faiths,

496
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 and I think in other religious faiths overall.

497
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 But it's called chiastic interpretation.

498
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 It's a way of looking at biblical text or holy works and having a mirror image of it.

499
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 I was trying to understand it really for you guys.

500
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 I was really trying to figure out what in the world that meant.

501
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,920
 It's like how Bible verses could be read the same way backwards and forwards and things like that.

502
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,920
 So, Bruce said in his email he heard of someone who actually had gone to this guy's house back in the day.

503
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,920
 Because it wasn't like, from what I understand, it wasn't a completely isolated farmhouse.

504
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
 It probably was on the outskirts of town, but according to Bruce's email,

505
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,920
 he knew someone who had gone there and said there were mirrors all over the corners of the room.

506
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
 Little mirrors.

507
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,920
 So it makes sense because they have this idea of mirror reflection.

508
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 So the fact that he says he chose Ohio to come to because that has a mirror type thing.

509
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 It's not like a paladrome, if that's the thing, where it's the same backwards and forward,

510
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
 but you have O-O and then two words in the middle.

511
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 That's why he chose Ohio.

512
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 1010, 1988 was a very, very powerful chiastic date.

513
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 Because you have all these duality, all this reflection in it.

514
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,920
 And then that is the day that just happened to be where the RLDS church excommunicated him.

515
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 That same day, massive thunderstorm.

516
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 That same day, huge rainbow.

517
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,920
 So all these events are happening and Jeffrey turns to his followers and goes,

518
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
 "The seven seals have been opened." Well, the first one.

519
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 The other six will be opened soon, but this is the beginning of the end of the world.

520
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,920
 I have been kicked out of this church of man.

521
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
 We are a church of God.

522
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 And then there was a huge rainstorm and then a rainbow.

523
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 And everyone's like, "Those usually follow each other up."

524
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

525
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
 But it's on a special day, so the rainbow is extra special.

526
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,920
 He realizes that the end of the world is coming and they have to be able to secure their place.

527
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
 They can't take the Kirtland Temple, though.

528
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 There's too many eyes on them, but they still need a blood sacrifice.

529
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,920
 What's someone they have access to who's expendable?

530
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,920
 Dennis Avery and his family.

531
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,920
 Dennis Avery was a devout member of this church, but they lived off the farm.

532
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 But, you know, they would have functions together, so April 17th, 1989, when they're invited to go to the farm.

533
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 I don't really think anything of it. It's just going to be a big old party, right?

534
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,920
 You have Dennis. He's 47 years old. His wife, Cheryl. She's 41.

535
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 And then three daughters, Trayna, who's 15, Rebecca, who's 13, and Karen, who's 7.

536
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,920
 On April 17th, 1989, Lundgren's wife noticed something roll through the field.

537
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 That morning, the fog was blood red. Just yet another sign that the apocalypse was near.

538
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,920
 That night, Dennis is invited into the barn. He walks in and he knows something's up.

539
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,920
 There's a running chainsaw just sitting on a stump in the corner of the barn.

540
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 Jeffrey Lundgren and all of his closest associates in this cult are there.

541
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,920
 The women have all been sent away to go shopping. He walks into the barn. He's immediately assaulted.

542
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,920
 He's tased. He's trying to fight back. He is subdued. He is bound.

543
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,920
 His hands are bound behind his back. He sees a massive pre-Doug hole.

544
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,920
 He's thrown into the hole and shot to death.

545
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,920
 Nobody can hear the gunshot in the farmhouse near the barn because the chainsaw's running.

546
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,920
 Cheryl is then invited out of the farmhouse into the barn.

547
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 When she walks in there, they tell her, "Just go with it."

548
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,920
 And she is calm. She doesn't react. She sees her husband is already dead in the pit.

549
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,920
 Without a word, they bind her arms behind her back, throw her into the pit, and shoot her.

550
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 They then do that same action with their three children.

551
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,920
 Karen, the seven-year-old, was the last one to be taken to the barn.

552
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,920
 She was given a piggyback ride out there by a cult member before she meets the same fate as the rest of her family.

553
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,920
 The pit is covered up with dirt and lime. The sacrifice has been made.

554
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,920
 Whatever happens now, their place in heaven is secure. That's what they believed.

555
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,920
 That happened on April 17th. On April 18th, the FBI shows up.

556
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 Because they had reports of gunfire.

557
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,920
 Not that night, but just weirdo cults running around with guns.

558
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:10,920
 The police had sent their concerns to the FBI. The FBI happened to show up the day after the murders to talk to the cult members and to look for guns.

559
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:21,920
 At one point, the FBI agents actually go into the barn, are walking on the freshly covered up grave of five people, but they don't even know it.

560
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,920
 They don't see anything suspicious involving firearms. They decide to keep an eye on this group and then they leave.

561
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,920
 At this point, all the members of Jeffrey Lundgren's cult realizes they need to get out of the area.

562
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,920
 Judgment day or not, their judgment day could be coming much quicker.

563
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:49,920
 Every member of the cult knew what was going on. Not every member of the cult participated in the murders, but everyone knew this was going to happen to the family.

564
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,920
 So they all picked up and they went to Missouri and they began splintering off from there.

565
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:10,920
 That happened in April. December 1989, a cult member actually approaches authorities and says, "Guys, you might want to go check out this barn in Kirtland, Ohio. You're going to find a family of five buried in there."

566
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,920
 Why did he turn on the cult? Did he have all of a sudden a moral change of heart? Did he figure out that he didn't want to be part of this?

567
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:30,920
 Jeffrey started banging his wife. Jeffrey wanted a second wife and he took this man's current wife as Jeffrey's second wife and something as small as that broke this cult.

568
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:39,920
 I mean, it's not small if your wife's getting taken, but if Jeffrey had just been able to keep it in his pants, they probably could have gotten away with it at least for a little bit longer.

569
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:47,920
 They discovered the body's massive manhunt goes out. On the California-Mexican border on January 7th, 1990, Jeffrey Lundgren and his wife are arrested.

570
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:58,920
 Jeffrey Lundgren's wife and his son and 10 other members were indicted. A lot of them took pleas. Jeffrey got sentenced to death. His wife, his son, and two others got sentenced to life in prison. They weren't going to get out.

571
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:09,920
 But a lot of them have been free since 2010. Some of them got really minor charges because a lot of them were taking plea deals and ratting out Jeffrey and the Inner Circle.

572
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:17,920
 But a lot of the people who are involved in this are free now. Jeffrey, though, was sentenced to death, but he goes, "You guys can't kill me."

573
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,920
 Not because he's some sort of immortal God, because he's the one true man on earth with the connection to God. He says, "You can't kill me because I'm too fat.

574
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:36,920
 You can't give me a lethal injection because I'm so fat. It would be cruel and unusual. I mean, it's not like you could throw me in a pit and shoot me in the head and then throw a doppelganger of me and shoot him in the head

575
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:49,920
 and watch me watch my own family die as I'm dying on top of my body. That's fine. But it'd be cruel and unusual to give a fat man a drug that will knock him out and then stop his heart."

576
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:59,920
 But the court goes, "This kind of stupid excuse. Get on a treadmill. We're killing you anyways." He was executed on October 24th, 2006.

577
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:05,920
 And an interesting little side note to this whole story. I thought this was fascinating. As I read in this article, I think it was in the Huffington Post.

578
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 They were interviewing Ronald Lough. He was the second in command of this cult and he was the second in command during this murder. He was in prison for the rest of his life.

579
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:27,920
 And there was a quote here from him. It said, "A guard once asked me what it was like to be brainwashed. I immediately responded. It's a lot more captivating than this place."

580
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:36,920
 Even though he was physically trapped in a prison and couldn't leave, that was more freedom than being brainwashed under the thumb of this cult leader.

581
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:44,920
 I was a really fascinating look at being brainwashed and what it's like to be on the other side of that. He realized that now. He's like, "Wow, such a prisoner of my own thoughts."

582
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,920
 But he did participate in the murder of five people and he rightfully is serving the rest of his life in prison.

583
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:00,920
 You may scoff at the idea that curses exist or may scoff at the idea that Joseph Smith himself was able to curse a town that has lasted all this time.

584
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:10,920
 But it was just coincidence that Kirtland, Ohio has this horrible mass murder and there is cults everywhere. Mass murders everywhere. It's not unusual.

585
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:20,920
 And that's true. I mean, the curse part of the story could be apocryphal. Joseph Smith may not have the ability to actually curse an entire city for hundreds of years.

586
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:36,920
 But I do think there's another interesting takeaway from this. When you have a religious group that's bent on violence and looking for signs that they should commit that violence, there's always something that's left out of that equation.

587
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:49,920
 Satan can provide signs as well. The master of lies can also give you signs and symbols to make you think you're on the right path.

588
00:33:49,920 --> 00:34:05,920
 So when you're looking for those indicators that you are doing the right thing, it's not enough to look for those indicators, but you have to think, "Who would benefit the most from me following this path?"

589
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:20,920
 I believe they saw the signs. I believe they saw the fog. But I don't believe those came from any sort of divine power. I think they came from someplace darker and more menacing.

590
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:33,920
 They came from a source that wanted to see a family annihilated and then even more families destroyed when their loved ones are in prison for committing this act.

591
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:47,920
 Darkness can pretend to be a beacon of light just to lead you farther down the tunnel until the light shuts off and you are all alone in the darkness.
