1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 A dog defies all odds to save two little girls.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,720
 A world famous UFC fighter faces his greatest fear, alien abduction, and then we travel

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,560
 to the depths of the human psyche to meet a man who believes he can use the powers of

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,560
 the universe to turn his ex-girlfriend into humanity's god today on Dead or Avid Radio.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:36,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead or Avid Radio, I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,800
 Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
 Just a quick note, next week might be a little rough as far as release goes.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
 I have some family coming into the area so I'm gonna be spending some time with them.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,080
 I might have some reruns at the beginning of the week or might have some reruns at the

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,080
 end of the week.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:07,080
 Secondly, we gotta give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Kacen Jarpenter.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,320
 Kacen, thank you so much.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,800
 Obviously, that's a play on my name.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,600
 It'll be interesting if Kacen ever subscribes to any other Patreons because they won't get

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
 the joke.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,480
 But I really appreciate your support Kacen.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,840
 If you can't support the Patreon, we do have a merch store and if you can't do that, that's

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
 okay.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,040
 If you can't get the word out about the show, you can write a review.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,200
 Just tell your friends, it really, really, really, really helps a lot.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,160
 Kacen, you have control of the carpenter copter today.

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,760
 Hope that you have your flight certificate.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,240
 We are flying over to the Philippines, specifically the year 2011.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,400
 It's December.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,880
 I remember the December 2011 in the Philippines.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,840
 I'm a big Filipino nut.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,240
 They used to call me like a fill head.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,600
 I know all about the country.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,280
 And I remember in 2011, huge massive storms.

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
 I think it was the air pressure was kind of high.

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,920
 I think it was like 28 or like, I don't know what's high barometer thing flying through

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 a storm.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
 You're like, Jason, I'm trying to listen to this while I'm going to sleep.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,480
 Don't make alarm noises.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
 Helicopter lands in Zambonga City.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,920
 Zambonga City.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
 That's actually rated the 11th best city to live in in the Philippines.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Fill head right here.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
 I know everything about Philippines.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
 And in the Philippines, we're going to meet a cast of characters, these lovable dudes.

43
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
 We have Dina.

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
 She's 11 year old girl.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
 She's waving to us from across the street.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 Hey, Dina.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,320
 And then her niece, Princess, who's three years old.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
 Hey, Dina, Princess.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
 Sorry, I called you Dina.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
 Get in the names mixed up.

51
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then like we're waving it.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,280
 And then we actually might be the cause for this accident.

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,560
 So as we're waving, we notice they also have a little dog there.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 It's a mutt.

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,720
 It's a little mutt dog named Ka-Bang.

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 Little puppies walking by.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,880
 Now Ka-Bang was found by Dina's dad, a dude named Rudy Bungal.

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,720
 And he found it in a swamp.

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,920
 The Philippines have the 11th best swamps in the world.

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,280
 So he found this dog.

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,680
 He found Ka-Bang in a swamp and brought it home to his kids.

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,640
 Now dogs, especially mutts in the Philippines are not looked upon very well.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,840
 They're not these lovable little scamp set star in animated films.

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,600
 They're just trash.

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,960
 They're trash with four legs.

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,680
 Now they do love dogs over there, but they're like bread dogs.

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 Pure bread dogs.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,360
 What's it even between pure bread and thorough bread?

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
 One's a horse, right?

70
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 This isn't a horse.

71
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
 It's a little puppy named Ka-Bang.

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
 And so we're waving to these girls and Ka-Bang's like, "Woof woof woof."

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,360
 And we're kind of distracting them because one day a motorcycle comes racing down the

74
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,040
 street and the girls are in the way because they're slowly crossing the street a little

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 bit.

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,080
 Let's get closer to them to wave and we're still waving and they're getting closer.

77
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,120
 This motorcycle's coming.

78
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
 And Ka-Bang, we don't see what's going to happen.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,240
 The girls don't see what's going to happen, but Ka-Bang sees what's going to happen.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,400
 Now dog doesn't die, but what's about to happen is kind of gross.

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,040
 So if you love dogs, just skip ahead and just go fast forward until you stop hearing me

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
 use the word dog or Ka-Bang.

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
 The motorcycle's coming, but don't actually because this is a lovable story.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,720
 The dog jumps in front of the motorcycle, right?

85
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,520
 And the motorcycle doesn't kill the girls because it was going that fast.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,600
 It was the 11th fastest motorcycle in the Philippines at that time.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:25,840
 The dog jumps in front of the motorcycle and gets its muzzle or nose, jaw thingy mouth,

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,160
 I guess is the other word for it, caught in the spokes of the motorcycle and rips its

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,840
 mouth open.

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,880
 Now the girls are freaking out, the motorcycle dude's freaking out.

91
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,080
 Rudy comes out and sees the dog and the dog was missing the top half of its mouth.

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
 Don't worry, this story has a happy ending.

93
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
 This isn't just gruesome injuries for beautiful animals.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,480
 This dog has the top of its mouth taken off and it's all bloody.

95
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,080
 Obviously, it wasn't laying on a pillow of cotton candy.

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,240
 Rudy comes out and he's like, "Oh no, I'm a dog."

97
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,120
 And they take the dog to the vet and the vet's like, "Uh, yeah, this isn't going to work,

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
 but I'm going to try.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
 I'm going to try my best."

100
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
 This dog saved these little girls' lives.

101
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,560
 This vet happened to be the 11th best vet in the Philippines, so he was able to save

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
 Cabang's life.

103
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,080
 But he only had like half a mouth and the top of his face was gone.

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,760
 So if you took a dog, don't do this, this is just for illustrative effect.

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,640
 If you took a dog with his mutt mouth, not a little pug, he had like the long snout

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,520
 and you cut off the top so now he just has a bottom jaw and nothing on the top.

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
 That's what it would look like.

108
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
 You could have a lot of photos of him in the show notes if you want to save this guy.

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,480
 And so they start, the word gets out about this guy.

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
 It goes viral.

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
 Little Cabang saved these two little girls.

112
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,560
 Can you just donate some money to help this dog?

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,760
 They end up raising $22,000.

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,360
 The dog is sent to America, so now he's like, "Now he is an animated puppy."

115
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,000
 So he's like, "Living in the boat."

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
 And there's a song where he's like, "Dance with all the other dogs on the boat."

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 And they're like, "Ugh."

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 Trying to avert their eyes.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,440
 They're like, "Oh, that's such a gruesome injury."

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,200
 But because that's what you normally do.

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,880
 You see something, you're like, "Oh, whoa, what happened to you?"

122
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,000
 And then you go, "Ah, never mind."

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,520
 You have an initial reaction to something.

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
 Then you get over it and you're like, "Ah, whatever."

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
 So that's what this musical number is about.

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,520
 The dog's going, "Dude, what's up with that dog?"

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,040
 And then he's like, "I'm just being me.

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,880
 Just being a dog who saved some girls."

129
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,400
 And then the other dogs are like, "Yeah, I guess that's cool."

130
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,540
 You know, its appearance is fur deep.

131
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,680
 So then they do a dance number.

132
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,360
 They get off the boat and then he goes to the vet.

133
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,760
 And the vet, a bunch of vets were doing all these surgeries on him and he's still alive.

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,920
 So now they said, "Listen, we just wanted to make it so he was functional.

135
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,720
 We weren't worried about his cos-- There was no cosmetic surgery.

136
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,760
 So basically now he looks like a pug with a big old jaw."

137
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,400
 And he's super happy.

138
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,120
 And you're like, "Jason, that's just a story about a dog getting his mouth caught in the

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,840
 gears of a motorcycle."

140
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 But that's not all.

141
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,160
 Because he actually-- So they take him into the vet thing and they fix him up.

142
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,360
 And then they say, "Whoa, he goes to get up and he starts seeing a dance number.

143
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
 New mouth, new life, new--" And they're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, cabang, cabang.

144
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
 Sit back down."

145
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,360
 Because while they were fixing his mouth, they realized he had heartworm.

146
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,440
 I was wondering what that horrible worm-like moving pain was in my heart.

147
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,800
 He had heartworm, which is typical of dogs in like the swamps, in the swampier regions.

148
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
 And he had a tumor the size of a golf ball inside of him.

149
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,160
 So he was like, "Oh, I was wondering why golfers kept chasing me down the street.

150
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
 Just thought people hated me."

151
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
 So not-- And they took him out.

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 They didn't leave him in there.

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,240
 They just didn't go, "Oh, he has heartworm and a golf ball tumor, but you don't have

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
 enough money for that.

155
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
 So get another go fund me."

156
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,240
 So cabang saves the lives of his master's daughter and master's niece.

157
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
 They're all a family.

158
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,920
 And he saved himself by getting a golf ball tumor removed and getting all the heartworm

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
 cured.

160
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,440
 So had he not jumped into the way of that motorcycle, he would be dead already.

161
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 And so would these girls.

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,240
 So sometimes it's better-- The moral of the story, I guess, is sometimes it's better

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,000
 to be hideously disfigured.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
 Because one, you get a couple of musical numbers out of it.

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
 Two, you might have saved someone's life by doing it.

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,080
 I just remembered a horrible story that's the opposite of this.

167
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,320
 And then three, might save your own life as well.

168
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,520
 So good on you, cabang.

169
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
 As far as the Philippines concerned, you may be ranked 11th in dogs that have had cosmetic

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,040
 surgery funded by GoFundMe's in America.

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,000
 But to Dead Rabbit Radio, you're the number one puppy in our book.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,160
 It was funny though, as of now, I've got to go to this Dara moment.

173
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,920
 When I was in Sacramento, I had a buddy who was dating this dude.

174
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,440
 And they came up-- Not my friend.

175
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,960
 My friend was this girl.

176
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,160
 She was dating this guy who came up with this-- This is all public knowledge at this point.

177
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,000
 So I'm not ratting anyone out, as in the newspaper.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
 She was dating this Russian dude.

179
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,000
 And this Russian guy and his friend decided to pull some insurance scam by setting a restaurant

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,640
 that the friend owned on fire.

181
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,680
 So they doubt-- You like how the tone changes?

182
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
 Because this story is kind of dark.

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
 Sorry.

184
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,040
 If you skipped the dog stuff and this is where you're coming back in, I apologize.

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,880
 But anyways, this story must have taken place back in 2004, 2005.

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,520
 I've never really looked it up.

187
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,920
 I remembered reading about it when it happened, and then years later, I met someone involved

188
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
 in this.

189
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
 My friend was dating this Russian guy.

190
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,640
 And so what happened was these two Russian guys wanted to burn down this restaurant in

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,080
 Sacramento to get insurance money.

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
 So they doused the place in gas, which is stupid.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,720
 But they doused-- Most crimes are stupid.

194
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,880
 Arson's probably the easiest crime to get caught with, because there's dedicated arson investigators.

195
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,720
 You commit a homicide, you're going to have a homicide investigator after you.

196
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,640
 You commit petty theft or graffiti or stuff like that.

197
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
 Most of the time, it's just whoever cop shows up on the scene or whatever cop gets the report,

198
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,760
 it'll be some beat cop after you.

199
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 So you can smash many windows as you want.

200
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,840
 But once you start setting fires, you'll have a dedicated arson investigator who is as good

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,340
 as a homicide detective.

202
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,280
 Their specialty is just tracking down people.

203
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,120
 It's very, very hard to get away with arson.

204
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,520
 Obviously, your mileage may vary.

205
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,480
 And I want to get a bunch of emails from arson as being like, "I'm still out there, and I'm

206
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 smoking."

207
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,600
 Yeah, whatever.

208
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,560
 But anyways, these two dudes were decided to come up with a scam, and they doused the

209
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,480
 place in gasoline, or some sort of-- It may not have been gasoline specifically, but I

210
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
 believe it was.

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,920
 It was some sort of something that would ignite on fire, and they're on opposite sides

212
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
 of the building.

213
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,440
 And the one guy was standing outside the door.

214
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,400
 The other guy was apparently opening the door to get out, and the dude on the other side

215
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
 of the building ignited the fire.

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,280
 And the guy who was still-- He was just getting out just then.

217
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,840
 The air ignited and torched him, burned him super battling.

218
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
 He stumbles out of the building.

219
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
 He's on fire.

220
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,720
 And my friend was-- She wasn't dating the guy who got set on fire.

221
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,320
 She was dating the other guy.

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,000
 And she dumped him because-- She dumped him.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,800
 I don't know if it was because of the arson conviction, or she was just done with him

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
 because she kind of rotated through him in pretty quickly.

225
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,400
 But she was saying that-- And I remember reading about it in the newspaper, "Oh, that's tragic.

226
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,880
 Committing a crime for financial gain.

227
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,720
 You're permanently disfigured."

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,880
 And-- But you live with it.

229
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,200
 If you got horribly burned, or you got all your limbs blown off and stuff like that,

230
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,280
 you can still live-- It would be horrible if it happened at the same time.

231
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,200
 But even if it did, you just got to roll with the punches.

232
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,920
 That's just the way life is.

233
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,040
 And that actually plays in our next segment, honestly.

234
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,800
 But the idea is that-- He got horribly burned.

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,320
 And I guess he was a really vain guy.

236
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
 He was a really good-looking guy.

237
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,720
 And he was always about his looks and his hair and his face and stuff like that.

238
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,200
 And she goes-- I walked into the hospital room to see him, and he just was completely just

239
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,080
 burned up.

240
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 Completely burned up.

241
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,760
 And he said that he looked like a monster.

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,840
 He couldn't even look at himself.

243
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
 He looked like a monster.

244
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,840
 And he ended up dying within a year.

245
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,680
 And I go, "Did he kill himself?"

246
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
 And she just kind of shrugged.

247
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,200
 And she goes, "He just gave up."

248
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,680
 I'm sure it was a struggle having to deal with the wounds and stuff like that.

249
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,480
 But she didn't-- She just goes, "He just gave up."

250
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,040
 So I don't know if he was in, still doing recovery, and he just lost the will to live,

251
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,840
 or maybe he OD'd or something like that.

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,120
 But yeah, ooh.

253
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,160
 So that's-- The Kabang story is much more uplifting.

254
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,920
 I don't know-- Why did I get onto that one?

255
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,800
 Just talking about gruesome injuries and stuff like that.

256
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,600
 The moral of the story for that one is, just don't commit crimes or stupid crimes.

257
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,040
 You might have to still bread for your family or something like that, or cheat on some sort

258
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
 of-- I don't know.

259
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
 I don't know.

260
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
 You know what I'm saying.

261
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 Just don't blow stuff up.

262
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

263
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
 Our next story is really short.

264
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,280
 It's actually-- I'm cribbing this from the Joe Rogan podcast, but it raises an interesting

265
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
 question.

266
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,800
 George-- George's?

267
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 George's?

268
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 St. Pierre.

269
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,440
 He's a UFC fighter.

270
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,200
 I believe he's retired now.

271
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,920
 His trainer was on the Joe Rogan show.

272
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
 His trainer was Farras Zahabi.

273
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,880
 And Farras was just, you know, Joe Rogan's podcast.

274
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,120
 They just kind of-- It's a really good podcast.

275
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,200
 I'm sure you guys have heard of it, but Joe Rogan just kind of weaves through the conversation,

276
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
 kind of lets it go where it goes.

277
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,800
 And this part of the conversation, Farras says, "Yeah, I used to travel with George's,

278
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
 and we'd be in the hotel room.

279
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
 One day I was in the bathroom and I was brushing my teeth because we'd share a room together

280
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
 sometimes.

281
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,080
 Came out of the bathroom.

282
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,520
 There was a foam roller laying on the ground in front of the door and I moved it.

283
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,960
 This UFC fighter jumps up and goes, "No, no, no, no, don't move it!

284
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
 Don't move it!

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
 Don't move it!"

286
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
 And Zahabi was like, "Uh, what's going on?"

287
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,600
 He goes, "No, no, no, I have to leave that there."

288
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
 Because this is the way that it works.

289
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,560
 If aliens abduct me, they'll come into the room and they'll grab me and they'll take

290
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,000
 me to their spaceship, but then they'll erase my mind and I'll never know if I was abducted.

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,280
 However, I'll know because the foam roller has moved away from the door.

292
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,600
 The aliens won't remember to put the foam roller back.

293
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,000
 So then I'll know I was abducted.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,480
 Which to Joe Rogan had a great comment to this.

295
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 This was his quote.

296
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,760
 "Doesn't he think the aliens can come through walls?

297
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
 How are they taking them out?

298
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,720
 Taking them through the hallway holding his hand?"

299
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
 Which is true.

300
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,120
 But the reason why I wanted to highlight this, which isn't, it's not true that they'll

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
 do that.

302
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,920
 One, the image of a guy walking through a hotel hallway with an alien holding his hand like

303
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
 to out the lobby and nobody noticing is quite comical.

304
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,280
 But we covered this before.

305
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,120
 Not this particular incident, but there was the guy who, I think it was Michael Menken

306
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,200
 or Melken.

307
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,480
 He sold the hats that could prevent you from being abducted or the aliens were eating your

308
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
 mind.

309
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
 They also cured autism.

310
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
 He sold those hats.

311
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,320
 That was probably about 60 episodes ago.

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,640
 We did that one.

313
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,120
 And he also believed that you could put a door lock on a door.

314
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,100
 There was like this advanced door stopping technology that would prevent yourself from

315
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
 being abducted.

316
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,960
 The idea of aliens having to open and close your door is bizarre to begin with.

317
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,560
 They have interstellar travel, but they have to come through a doorway.

318
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,800
 That almost sounds folklorious to me.

319
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,160
 And we've talked about that as well.

320
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,000
 A lot of times where we see this blending between like elves and fairies and gnomes of

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,360
 old world stuff and then aliens of today.

322
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,600
 The idea of being kidnapped, of being replaced.

323
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,760
 But this is like you have to invite them in type of thing like a vampire show.

324
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,360
 They have to come through a doorway.

325
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,400
 Opens up a whole bunch of questions.

326
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,280
 I think the most interesting question, two of them.

327
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,600
 One, if you were abducted, would you want to know?

328
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,040
 Like would it be better to just not know?

329
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,600
 Not to have like horrible visions or every time you see like ET, you're totally like

330
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
 peeing your pants.

331
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,960
 But like you don't have any idea whatsoever.

332
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,880
 You have no hang ups or weirdo fetishes for short gray people.

333
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,400
 You just have been abducted.

334
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 Aliens it's up to you.

335
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 You're brought back down.

336
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 You have no clue.

337
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
 Would you rather have that?

338
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,120
 Or would you rather remember the violation?

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,360
 Two, the second question is.

340
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,160
 Could a UFC, and we've gone over this a couple of times, but could a UFC fighter basically

341
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,880
 take over a spaceship single-handedly?

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
 Like I get it, they can paralyze you with your beams, but you still figure someone who's

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,760
 spent their life in the octagon has more willpower than your average dairy farmer.

344
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,480
 Could be wrong on that.

345
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,160
 I think they could probably override the gray's mental control.

346
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,880
 But yeah, it's funny because this little incident, this little thing on the Joe Rogan

347
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,720
 show really like opens up a bunch of questions about grays.

348
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,080
 Not alien abductions in general, and it also shows that even UFC fighters are afraid of

349
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
 something.

350
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
 Which I mean, I guess we figured.

351
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,880
 I wonder how many of them are afraid of the dark and they're like, "No, I don't want

352
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 to get choked out.

353
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
 No, no, no, it's my worst fear."

354
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,560
 Getting choked out does not hurt at all.

355
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,040
 And it's so funny because I used to read when I read a lot of true crime, they'd be like,

356
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,280
 and then he strangled her and I'm like, "Oh my God, that must be so horrible."

357
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
 It's not that bad.

358
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,100
 I'm not recommending you do it to people, but if you ever find yourself in a situation

359
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,040
 where you're getting murdered and getting strangled, you should just go fight back,

360
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
 obviously, fight back.

361
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,600
 But if you lose the fight, just go, "Ah, there's worse ways to go."

362
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,800
 If you're listening to this podcast right now and being murdered at the same time, yeah,

363
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 don't worry about it.

364
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,680
 Let's move on to our last topic here, and I hope I have time for this.

365
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,280
 This is, I don't want to read through this because it's actually quite wordy, but there's

366
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,360
 a four, it sucks because it's on four chance, so it's gone at this point.

367
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,720
 So I could read through it, but I think it's kind of slow going.

368
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,460
 But anyways, back on December 23rd, 2019, this guy posted a thing on 4chan called "Worshipping

369
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,220
 My Tinder Date."

370
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,820
 And he goes on to say, I'll read some specific quotes from this, "I pray to her every night

371
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
 before bed."

372
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,860
 Okay, that's fine, dear.

373
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,300
 I'm trying to think like, I, okay, I'll see this.

374
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
 I've had a one-night-us.

375
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,860
 I've had a girl that I was totally head over in heels with and it's just like, "Oh my

376
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,540
 God, why can't I have?

377
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,760
 Why can't I be with her?

378
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,520
 Oh my God, it hurts my heart.

379
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 Why, universe?

380
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
 What, whatever."

381
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,480
 Like, I, and I can't say that I only had those when I was younger.

382
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,520
 Like I think the last one I had was like, when I was like 32.

383
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,600
 And then I just kind of was like, "Mmm, no, I'm not doing that anymore."

384
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,040
 And it sucks because it actually ruined another relationship.

385
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,760
 I believe it ruined another relationship.

386
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
 I was in this one, I was in this long-distance thing where I was pining over this girl for

387
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
 years and years and years.

388
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
 And it didn't work out.

389
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,020
 And then I met this other girl and she, we, we had this great time together and she's

390
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,820
 like, "I gotta go to LA and take care of some stuff."

391
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,740
 My mom and my dad are down there.

392
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,940
 But I would like to, you know, do something.

393
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,340
 I would like to be with you.

394
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,500
 And I was like, "Nope, I don't do anything long-distance because I had such a bad experience

395
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 the first time."

396
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,780
 And that girl was honestly the, probably the nicest woman I've ever met outside my mom.

397
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
 And she was gorgeous.

398
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,240
 But I was like, "I'm not doing that."

399
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,840
 And we still talk from time to time and I kind of feel bad about that.

400
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,000
 Like I think if, I can't do a long-term relationship, but she was like, "Give me a year type of

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 thing."

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,120
 And I was like, "Ugh, it sucked.

403
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,040
 I didn't put any work into it."

404
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,240
 But so that's the problem too is those one-nightest things can kind of ruin your, is this person

405
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,600
 was taking advantage of you.

406
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,120
 My one-nightest was taking advantage of me.

407
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,440
 She's basically stringing me along.

408
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,900
 I was dating other girls at the time, but I was always pining for this one.

409
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
 This episode is getting oddly personal.

410
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,700
 I was always pining for this one girl.

411
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,140
 I was dating these other girls here and there.

412
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
 Anyways, whatever.

413
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,780
 But I think it did end up ruining my relationship with this other woman.

414
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,180
 So, and she was awesome.

415
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,500
 Anyways, anyways.

416
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,400
 So that's the, I didn't intend on revealing that information.

417
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,900
 This guy, and I didn't pray to these girls every night.

418
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
 I've never done that.

419
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,440
 This guy, I pray to her every night.

420
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,800
 But he says he can't get her out of his head.

421
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,520
 And then we go to this quote, "Perhaps one day, if I acquire the necessary amounts of

422
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:54,800
 wealth to do such a thing, we'll strike up pillars, statues, and synagogues?"

423
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,300
 Synagogues.

424
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,640
 So yeah, I don't know how you build a synagogue for someone.

425
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,320
 This was just such a weird, why is synagogue?

426
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,860
 Like are synagogues normally named after people?

427
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,060
 Is there like, what?

428
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 That doesn't make any sense.

429
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
 Well none of this makes sense.

430
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
 I don't know why I'm getting hung up on that.

431
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,700
 But anyways, so pillar statues and synagogues to pay homage to her beauty.

432
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,060
 That'd be so weird walking down the street and it's Tinder date number three synagogue.

433
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,860
 And people are like, "Oh, should I pray here?"

434
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
 I don't know.

435
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,820
 Maybe I should just go down the street to one that's actually like a real synagogue as

436
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,860
 opposed to this one.

437
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,700
 But this stained glass window is just a picture of a girl taking a selfie.

438
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,840
 He goes on to say that he's revealed a lot to this woman and I'm wondering if he's done

439
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,500
 it in person or just through prayer.

440
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,520
 But it says that the whatever the case, whether it's just through praying to this woman in

441
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,120
 a synagogue made for her or actually talking to her on Tinder, it's not even clear if he's

442
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,400
 met this woman in real life, which is what's creepy about it.

443
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,480
 He says, "This woman has awoken an insatiable devotion deep within me.

444
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,780
 I wish I could utter her true name on this post.

445
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,260
 Alas, doing such a thing has the potential to jeopardize precisely what makes her outstanding."

446
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,940
 The unknowingness of her power is so pure.

447
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,580
 If she ever finds out her raw strength, it will be the end of the world.

448
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:24,220
 And again, when I have been pining over a woman, this is just weird, right?

449
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,700
 Like I'm not raw.

450
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,360
 You guys aren't nodding your head to this and being like, "Oh yeah dude, she would destroy

451
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,400
 the world, just like my girlfriend.

452
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,680
 Is he talking about my girlfriend?"

453
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,880
 This is weird, right?

454
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,200
 Sometimes I feel, I don't think I'm special or separate from humanity, but I think my

455
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,440
 view on relationships is much more blunt than other people's.

456
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,400
 So maybe I'm the odd one out.

457
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,380
 But yeah, I remember seeing this girl recently and I told her, I did something nice for

458
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,380
 her and I said, "Remember this three months from now when you're telling all your friends

459
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,380
 what a jerk I am, what a horrible guy I am."

460
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,580
 And she goes, "Why would I do that?"

461
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,300
 And I'm like, "You'll see, you'll see."

462
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,860
 Because I've dated, I've never been in a relationship longer than a year.

463
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,060
 Most of my relationships are very, very short.

464
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,180
 So I know exactly how they all play out.

465
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,020
 And even when I started seeing this girl recently, I made a comment like that.

466
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,280
 I said, "Yeah, you know, it'll last a couple months and then it'll just be over with three

467
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
 months tops."

468
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
 My friend goes, "Why?"

469
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,440
 And I go, "Listen, this is the key.

470
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
 This is how this works out."

471
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,140
 I don't change at all.

472
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,160
 My personality is exactly the same.

473
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,740
 But what happens is it starts off being very attractive and funny and I'm charming and

474
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,320
 I'm humble and I'm self-assured.

475
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,520
 I go, "And then three months from now, I don't take anything seriously.

476
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:55,820
 I'm glib or flirting with other women and instead of being self-assured, I'm cocky or

477
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,820
 arrogant."

478
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
 I haven't changed at all.

479
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
 Your perception of me has changed.

480
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,420
 You go from liking me to being irritated by me to disgust to outright hatred.

481
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,660
 And the point is to break up in between liking me and being irritated by me.

482
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
 You can be a little irritated by me.

483
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
 We break up.

484
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,620
 We're still totally good or kosher because there's going to be a synagogue based on me.

485
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,920
 But once it starts to get to disgust and hatred, then it starts to get bad.

486
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,560
 But I don't generally break up with people.

487
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,080
 I just keep going and then they are like, "I'm done."

488
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,480
 And I'm like, "Okay."

489
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,240
 I normally don't pull the trigger on that.

490
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,160
 But oddly enough, I do always hang up first.

491
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,840
 I never let people, like, "We're talking on the phone.

492
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
 I start to notice a little in the conversation.

493
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 Hey, I gotta go."

494
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
 "Uh, okay."

495
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
 Like, I don't let them hang up on me.

496
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,120
 But I will let them dump me.

497
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,260
 You're bizarre, little Jason, so I know.

498
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,780
 Anyways, so this is the guy also goes on to say this.

499
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,780
 Now he wants us to find the salvation in this random girl on Tinder.

500
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,480
 "I will also pray maybe you one day will come across her and bask in her eternal warmth.

501
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,420
 But until then, you must have hope.

502
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,700
 Your decisions and life, at the very least, lead you to a location within a mile radius

503
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,060
 of her aura, not directly in front of her.

504
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,020
 Just someday you're going to be traveling through Tucson, Arizona and be like, "I can

505
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
 feel I'm close."

506
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,680
 Why not just in front of you?

507
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,240
 What is this guy's problem?

508
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,000
 I don't want to be a mile from the most amazing woman ever.

509
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,200
 Just if I, if you can control the universe, put me there.

510
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,880
 But anyways, lead you to a location within a mile radius of her aura, as that will surely

511
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,600
 be enough to invigorate you for another decade or two.

512
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 I guess I should have read the rest of that sentence before I went off on that.

513
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 So I guess just being around her energizes you.

514
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,040
 Then this is the clue here, because right now we don't know his relationship with this

515
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 girl.

516
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,680
 It ends with this, "Too long didn't read.

517
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,640
 She's cut contact."

518
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,780
 So she has been talking to this girl.

519
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,080
 And then she cut him off.

520
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,000
 She's cut contact because I spurge, I don't know how to pronounce that word, spurge basically,

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 like, went overboard.

522
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,520
 She's cut contact because I went overboard and I can't shake her from my mind.

523
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,320
 So using the law of attraction, I will pray her back into my life.

524
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,880
 And that is the core, and that's why I wanted to talk about this.

525
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,840
 I didn't want to just highlight this guy's email because it's weird.

526
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,720
 I wanted to talk very briefly about the law of attraction and how it relates to this,

527
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,800
 because I see this a lot, especially on 4chan.

528
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,520
 People go, "How can I law of attraction a woman or a man?"

529
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,400
 I don't know what you're into, but how can I law attraction someone into my life?

530
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
 You can't.

531
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,480
 Little asterisks there.

532
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,040
 This is the interesting thing.

533
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,320
 And this has ramifications for a lot of stuff that's coming up.

534
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,440
 Law of attraction, very, very briefly, is what you...

535
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,560
 The universe wants to give you what you want.

536
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,840
 So you have to put into the universe what you want.

537
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,000
 You have to believe, too, that you already have it.

538
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,560
 I suggest people reading the science of getting rich by Wallace Waddles.

539
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,720
 It's a great book.

540
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,520
 You can find it anywhere because there's no copyright to it.

541
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,800
 It's from the 1890s.

542
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
 It's before the secret.

543
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,040
 It's before thinking to grow rich.

544
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,560
 It's what those books are based on.

545
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
 Read this book.

546
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
 It's fascinating.

547
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,320
 But you have to believe you already have it.

548
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 I use visualization and the science of getting rich to promote this show.

549
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,000
 And I've talked about that in past shows.

550
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,560
 I visualize myself already having 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 listeners.

551
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,800
 I visualize that in my head.

552
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,920
 And I honestly believe it helps the show grow.

553
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,560
 Now, obviously, you have to visualize and do the work.

554
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,240
 If I just released one episode a month and sat in Daydream having 10,000 listeners,

555
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 it's not going to work.

556
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,920
 Because you have to do the work as well, and that's a key component.

557
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,040
 So read the book, Science of Getting Rich.

558
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,080
 I've thought about doing an audiobook version of it.

559
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,240
 But read the book.

560
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,040
 But this is what I want to get into.

561
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,920
 You can't use the law of attraction because you go, "OK, you can hack the universe, Jason.

562
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 You can get people to listen to your show."

563
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,640
 I'm not making people listen to my show.

564
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,120
 I'm putting it out in the universe that makes it more likely for people to find my show in

565
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
 the first place.

566
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,840
 If the show sucks, they're not going to listen to it.

567
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,320
 It's not a zombie power.

568
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,720
 I'm not a warlock.

569
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 But what I can do is I can maneuver the universe into a place that makes it more likely that

570
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,880
 a new listener finds it.

571
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,480
 A new listener who's looking for a show like this can find it.

572
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,320
 So can you do that with a particular person?

573
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,880
 You can't.

574
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,960
 Now you can put out to the universe, "I want to meet someone with these particular attributes."

575
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,440
 Now, of course, if you're like, "Oh, she got a big boobs and a giant butt," like technically,

576
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,160
 yes, you could do that.

577
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,920
 But again, you have to put in the work.

578
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,480
 If you want a gorgeous, gorgeous woman who's smart and intelligent and funny and all this

579
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,880
 stuff, you better be that as well.

580
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,400
 You can't be a shrub and want this perfect thing and you're not putting in the work yourself.

581
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,280
 And that's a big component to this law of attraction.

582
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,960
 If you are a total misanthrope and despise humanity and you want someone who looks like

583
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
 Taylor Swift and acts like Taylor...

584
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,760
 Or just Taylor Swift in general, it's not going to work because will your personality

585
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,200
 be attractive to someone who has all of the traits that you want?

586
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,440
 So I'm not saying that if you're cabang, you can't date a super hot chick.

587
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,600
 But if you're cabang and everything else works, you're missing the top half of your

588
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,480
 job but you're funny and you're smart and you're hardworking and stuff like that, then

589
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,240
 yeah, you can put into the universe to attract someone who's attracted to those traits.

590
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,880
 You can do a generic mate, but you can't do somebody specific.

591
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,280
 I could not all the times I sat around thinking about that girl that I really, really like

592
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,800
 and daydream and oh, we could go do this, we could go do that daydream into it mildly.

593
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,960
 That doesn't attract them.

594
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
 It does the opposite.

595
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
 This is really, really fascinating.

596
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
 We're going to end it like this.

597
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,840
 When you put out into the universe towards a specific person like that and you're saying,

598
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,880
 "I want you, I want you," you're visualizing that person coming to you, you're actually

599
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,120
 infusing that person with power to do their own thing.

600
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,440
 You're giving them strength.

601
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,160
 Let's say that I'm putting out into the universe and I use the science of getting rich.

602
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 I use it with all aspects of my life.

603
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,400
 When you're putting it out into the universe that you want this particular thing, let's

604
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,240
 say that you go, "But Jason, I hate you and I hate your show so I'm going to use visualization

605
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,920
 to make it so nobody listens to your show.

606
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,680
 That's not how it works because I'm the subject of the visualization.

607
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,360
 You're giving me power.

608
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
 You're making me stronger.

609
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,040
 That's why people go ignore the haters.

610
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,440
 The haters are putting energy on you and if you stop to think about them and engage with

611
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,120
 them, it's distracting.

612
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,560
 You're putting your energy into paying attention to negative things.

613
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,520
 You keep looking ahead and the haters, all of their energy is basically the wins in your

614
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
 sales.

615
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
 It doesn't matter what their intent is.

616
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,840
 You're the subject.

617
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
 You'll keep going ahead.

618
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,240
 It's fascinating because they're putting mental energy into you.

619
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,560
 Making you farther from them and closer to your goal.

620
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,920
 Can't stop to engage with them.

621
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,720
 Just keep going.

622
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
 So I want to say this.

623
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,640
 On episode 300, we put out that challenge about you guys changing your lives like I did with

624
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 this show.

625
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,720
 Back on episode 300, I said by episode 600, we all need to be in a different, better place

626
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 than we are today.

627
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,680
 I think we would be better for it.

628
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,120
 I think the world would be better for it.

629
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,800
 And so this is your first piece of homework.

630
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,280
 Here on episode, what?

631
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,880
 Episode 379, here's your first piece of homework.

632
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:28,360
 I want you starting today to start visualizing that new you.

633
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,520
 And I mean really visualizing it.

634
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,600
 The smell of your new workplace.

635
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,520
 The type of clothes you're going to wear when you're successful.

636
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,640
 I want you to feel the cloth against your skin.

637
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,520
 I want you to feel or maybe you're a bikini model and it's nylon.

638
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,280
 It doesn't matter.

639
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,960
 And if you are, give me a phone call.

640
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,120
 I want you to experience the warmth of the sun months from now.

641
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,720
 When you are in a different place in a different time as a different person.

642
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,400
 I want you to visual, because that's the way it works.

643
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,200
 I want you to visualize it to the second where you're going to be when you're successful.

644
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,040
 I want you to use this life hack as well.

645
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,960
 And this isn't a paid promotion.

646
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,580
 I'm not going to come out with a book that you need to buy.

647
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,440
 This is something, this is free from me to you.

648
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,760
 The science of getting rich, like I said, there's no affiliate link.

649
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,920
 You can find that anywhere.

650
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,040
 You can find it for free.

651
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,560
 It is not a copyrighted book because it's so old.

652
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,880
 That book honestly made me look at myself and the world so differently.

653
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,120
 You have to visualize your success to achieve it.

654
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,320
 Every bodybuilder in the world will tell you, "I pictured my body before I picked up my

655
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
 weights."

656
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
 You have to do that.

657
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,880
 So this is your homework.

658
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
 This is the first episode you're getting homework.

659
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,800
 I want you to visualize the new you.

660
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 Not this guy.

661
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,080
 This guy, hopefully he comes around and he realizes that this woman is just a mortal

662
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
 woman.

663
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,320
 And, because it's creepy and hopefully he doesn't try to murder this chick.

664
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,960
 But just leave her behind.

665
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
 I want it.

666
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,400
 And so if you're listening to this podcast, you do it too.

667
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,760
 But again, leave out the synagogues unless you're Jewish and then you can go to them.

668
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,440
 But don't build them for women is what I'm saying.

669
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
 And then I want you guys to, that's your homework.

670
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,880
 Start that process.

671
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,560
 Visualize that now.

672
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,680
 Think about it.

673
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,520
 Put it out into the universe.

674
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,440
 You'll have to do the work as well, but the first step is knowing that you've already

675
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,720
 gotten there.

676
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,400
 You have to believe you are already at the end goal.

677
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,880
 Because if you believe that it is true, the universe goes, "Oh, they're supposed to be

678
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 successful.

679
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,480
 I better start moving things in line."

680
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,240
 Because the universe believes you.

681
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,320
 The universe is yours to create.

682
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,480
 So let's get to work, guys.

683
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:27,080
 Let's start making better versions of ourselves today.

684
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,760
 Bye.

685
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,340
 (upbeat music)

686
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,920
 (upbeat music)
