1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 What happens when a little girl experiences one of the most terrifying paranormal events we've ever covered on this show?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we travel to Idaho to take a look at a fun adventure, take a look at a humorous adventure of what happens when two humans encounter two aliens.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 While our extraterrestrial neighbors may enjoy zipping around in spaceships,

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 what they really want to do is drive a car.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I go to the movies. That's pretty much what I do every weekend when I can.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Actually, you know what? Remind me, I want to talk to you about that movie thing.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 But first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is someone who always reminds me of everything, reminds me of all my long lost loves.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our longtime Patreon supporters.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Everyone give it up to Splacketorius.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Wee! Come on in!

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command. Splacketorius, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. It really is.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out so much.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And then also, look at this awesome artwork we have for Fan Art Friday.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 It's a little retro game boy with the Dead Rabbit Radio logo.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And this was created by Scion Online.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Scion Online, check out their YouTube channel. I'll put the links in the show notes.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 They also created a new custom outro for us.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 An 8-bit version of Bella Royale. So stay tuned for that at the end of the episode.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Thank you so much Scion Online. I love the artwork. I love the song. We'll be playing that soon.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And Splacketorius, first off, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Drive us all the way out to a house in the suburbs.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 This story, you know, we're researching these ghost stories all the time. Episode 1047.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But this might be one of the creepiest stories I've come across.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Maybe top 10. Maybe top 5. I don't want to build it up too much. I don't think I can.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 It's incredibly dark. It's incredibly creepy.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And normally I don't do this, but this is one of those stories where I'm actually going to just do screenshots.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 So we're not going to reveal this person's username, because they're still going through some stuff.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I want to give them a bit of privacy as far as that goes. Normally I like to have the username, so, you know, as a researcher, you like to have your sources there.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Otherwise, I can just post stuff online all day long and be like, "Look at this crazy thing I found. Isn't that nuts?"

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And you wouldn't know, right? So you have the sources there, so you can check my work, basically.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 This is going to be one of those stories that I'm not going to do that, because it's deeply personal and they're still ongoing issues.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So let's take a look at this. This is absolutely terrifying. It's very short, but...

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So we're going to go ahead and call this person... Sam.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Not the real name, not that I know of, right? Just posted online.

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But Sam, Samantha, said, "A long time ago when I was a kid, I had just, like, just gotten sexually assaulted.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And it happened in my house. It happened in my room.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 She says, "I had just been sexually assaulted and I was laying in my bed, and I wasn't asleep.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I was just laying there.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 My room was dark, but the whole light was on.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Bedroom door was open. I could hear the television playing downstairs in the living room.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And I'm laying in the bed and I'm looking down the hallway.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And all of a sudden, I see a face peeking out from around the corner.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 At the end of the hallway, I could clearly see this face leaning into the hallway.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Just staring at me.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It wasn't anyone who lived in that house. It was no one that I had seen before.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I'm laying there in bed. I'm looking down the hallway and I'm seeing this face.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And it's looking at me.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It's looking right at me.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And he's smiling.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 He has this huge grin on his face as he's watching me cower in the darkness.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's it. I mean, that's it.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And you would, she, I mean, she goes on to say she was so terrified she couldn't even scream.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But even that would have caused a huge host of problems, right?

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 If she had just been sexually assaulted by somebody in the house and she's a child,

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 you know, who's going to come to her rescue, right?

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 But it's an interesting, this is interesting on several levels, right?

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 First off, it's very Twin Peek-ish. This was one of those stories,

64
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 where, you know, I do this with a lot of them actually, but I go and look through other things they've posted.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Because again, if they're posting a lot of crazy, super spooky, paranormal stuff,

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 like that actually happened to me today. I was looking at this story.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 It was pretty spooky. And then I found out they had a YouTube channel where they told spooky stories.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Okay, this is probably made up.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 This particular person, I went through their posting history and we'll get into that in a second.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But very Twin Peek-ish, right? Very much like Twin Peaks with the Killer Bob character.

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 If you don't know about that show, Dead Rabbit Radio recommends Twin Peaks.

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 100% I love that show. There's a character named Killer Bob. It's a demon.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's a god. Who knows what it is.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But when people are being raped and murdered in this small town of Twin Peaks,

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 this hobo shows up and starts walking around the house.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And then you see certain people can see him. It's absolutely terrifying.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And it was on just regular television growing up.

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 There's so many different ways I can go with this, even though it's so short.

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 On the one hand you could say it was a demon, right? That this was some sort of entity, some sort of malevolent creature

80
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 being in this house and it was feeding off of her fear.

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You could also say that, well, I think you could also argue that it's a hallucination brought on by trauma,

82
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 which wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility at all, right?

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It's probably actually more in the possibility than a demon.

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But demon, hallucination, it could also have been kind of a combination of the two.

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Like she was seeing the essence of her abuser.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 This is all that we have. I pretty much read you verbatim what's written on here.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I didn't, because I don't do that. I just don't read stuff verbatim, but it's only five sentences long.

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So we don't know who the abuser is.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Was the abuser in the living room watching the television, which would make sense if that's where the grinning head,

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 she says peeking around the corner in the hallway, so we don't have a lot of specifics.

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But I mean, based on what we have, you could read it as that, right? That that is the abuser's essence.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Like the evil it would take to do that to any child.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Any child, let alone one in your house.

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's horrifying either way, but you know what I mean? Like someone under your care.

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That's why there's special laws for teachers, even if the student is 18, a teacher cannot have sex with an 18 year old

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 if they are in the district, if they're in that school district.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 It's against law. You'll go to prison.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The age of consent has nothing to do with it because they're still in your care.

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I don't know if it's the school district, it might just be in your particular school,

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 but people get caught up in that all the time. Teachers are sleeping with 18 year olds and they're like,

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 "You're going to jail for five years if you're a guy."

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 But, like what was this?

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 An entity, a hallucination, a visual representation of the person who just did this to her.

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 She doesn't state that she's ever seen this thing again. It happened back when she was a kid.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 It's terrifying. I mean, I guess the hallucination one is not super terrifying.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It is when you think about it, that creepy image of going through so much physical and emotional trauma that you're hallucinating.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 That's just a terrifying part of the human brain, but the idea that this horrible event happens and then she can see it.

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 She sees this creature.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 This is the interesting thing. We talked about this the other day with the story about Eddie the dog.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It's that as a paranormal researcher, as a person who has experienced paranormal events, I will often default to that.

111
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So when I read this, I thought a demon, a demon that is feasting.

112
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I think it would probably actually be feasting less on her pain and more on the evil in the perpetrator's heart.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 But it still is seeking more energy, more fear, right? That demons and dark entities feed off of fear.

114
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Terrifying thought.

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 She never really makes an assumption of what this is. She never really guesses.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 She just says seeing something like this is what made her a believer in the paranormal.

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So she knew it wasn't real.

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 She knew that this wasn't a person in the house wearing a mask. She knew this wasn't a person in the house pulling a prank.

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 She knew that what she was seeing did not exist.

120
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Or shouldn't exist.

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 But it's a terrifying story, you know, at a child's... a child is just vulnerable by nature.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And then you commit a heinous act and you make them even more vulnerable.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And then Samantha's seen something like this.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It's terrifying. Like there's just something... I know I probably use that word a lot, but there's just something so creepy about this.

125
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And not just creepy, but harmful.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 This is way worse than a ghost walking down the hallway. This is even worse than a bloody ghost appearing at like an old time saloon, a ghost town.

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 A haunted hotel. Like there's just something far, far more damaging and dangerous about something like this.

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 What... what was it?

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And obviously I keep saying about it feeding and enjoying the fear because it was smiling. It wasn't just a spooky face.

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 If a face poked out from around the wall and had a neutral expression...

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 That'd be one thing, but the grin.

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 That's what she remembers more than anything. The grin.

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I looked through the posting history again to see like is this, you know, is this just a spooky YouTube channel and they're out there pushing content?

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 I found a super recent post from this person maybe like a month or two ago.

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And it was quite sad. It was quite sad.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 She now is an adult. She's an adult and she has a husband of 11 years. They've been married.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And she goes, "He's a great dad and a good husband. He helps out around the house."

138
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But he is an addict.

139
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And he can get... I don't want to say aggressive. I don't... she didn't necessarily say that there was anything physical going on, but like emotionally aggressive.

140
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And so I started going through posting history again to kind of see if this is just a spooky YouTube channel.

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And going through her profile, I saw a couple of cleavage shots.

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 There were just close-ups of her breasts and it said like, "Which top do you like better? Like which color?"

143
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Kind of scrolling through. There's a lot of shots of her breasts.

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And I looked at it. So I look at it and I go, "Okay, I think she's probably advertising for an only fans."

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I thought this might be a weird way to advertise, right, to tell the story that I just told.

146
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But these photos are obviously, she's advertising some sort of porn site, most likely the only fans.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And that's continuing to look through her profile.

148
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And I came across a other comment she had left. And it's so sad. Nobody responded to this.

149
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 "You already feel alone in the world and now you're posting anonymously online." No one would respond.

150
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 She posts on this board and she goes, "I need to vent a little bit. My husband..."

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And so there she's married. She has kids now. She goes, "My husband, we've been together for 11 years. We have beautiful children."

152
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He's a really good dad. He's a good husband. He like, helps out around the house. I feel like we're part of a team.

153
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But he is an addict. Or he has addictions. She leaves all of this stuff fairly vague, which is fair, right?

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But she goes, "Sometimes he gets more demanding. Sometimes when he's not using, he's miserable."

155
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And he makes everyone else miserable. And I just kind of need to get all this stuff off my chest.

156
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And then she says, "He's also made me set up an only fans account."

157
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And he's making me post these pictures and I don't know what to do. No one responds to it. No one gives her any advice or a shoulder to cry on or anything like that.

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And that's sad. She's still now as an adult still being victimized.

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You could say it's her choice. You could say, "Jason, that's obviously her choice if she wants to take the pictures."

160
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's her choice if she wants to stay with this guy. And I think that's what she's struggling with.

161
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He has so many good qualities, but his bad qualities are bad. Being forced into pornography.

162
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And I'm not going to tie it all together and be like, "The grinning man. Maybe she married the grinning man.

163
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The grinning man is making her do only fans." I don't think the second part has any sort of paranormal connection.

164
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It's just the victimization of victims. You know what I mean?

165
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's not guaranteed if you've been a victim of something, you don't always have to be a victim.

166
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But victimizers look for that in people. Heavy stuff. Heavy, heavy stuff and creepy.

167
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The whole paranormal angle is one thing and then what's going on right now is terrifying in a different sort of way.

168
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 You're with a guy. You have four kids. He's making you do porn.

169
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Like, how do you leave that? You got four kids with the dude.

170
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Like, how do you just go, "Well, kids, we're leaving." You'd have to go through all the custody stuff and all that stuff.

171
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And then you got to go to Tucson, Arizona and get a job as a dental assistant.

172
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I mean, it can be done. It's possible. People do it. Or you can just take the pictures.

173
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And I think that's her mindset. Everything's going well, but he's an addict, which is the anti-definition of doing well.

174
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And he's pushing her into doing porn.

175
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And it's so interesting when I was looking at those photos of the boobs, right? They weren't spicy, right?

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 They weren't evocative of anything. They felt desperate.

177
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 This was before I knew. Like, I go, "Oh, this is only fans."

178
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Like, someone's trying to promote. And again, that made me going, "Well, is this story just a way to get some subscribers to her only fans?"

179
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 It would be a terrible advertisement for your porn site to say that when you were a child, something horrible happened to you, and then you saw a demon.

180
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Click here for my only fans. It's a terrible advertisement. But I did start to think, "I wonder what's going on?"

181
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And then I found that. It's just tragic, tragic story.

182
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But there's always... Not tomorrow. There's always right now to start making those little changes.

183
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But I mean, that sounds so stereotypical, right? That sounds so hand-wavy. Like, everything will be okay.

184
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I think I do believe everything will be okay or can be okay.

185
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 But there's nothing I can convey in the course of a podcast that will...

186
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Especially not talking to the person. I can tell you platitudes all day long.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I'm sure some of you, I'm sure a lot of you are kind of... Actually, I'm sure a lot of you guys are kind of going through the same thing in different ways.

188
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Sad story. Sad story. Creepy story to begin with. Sad story now, but it doesn't have to be a sad story tomorrow.

189
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It doesn't have to even be a sad story tonight. Things can change.

190
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Splacketorias, let's go and pass you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind this house.

191
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Take us all the way out to Idaho.

192
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Specifically, we're going to Rerea, Idaho. I expect several emails telling me I'm mispronouncing that.

193
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Rerea, Idaho, it's November 2nd, 1967. It's 9.30 p.m.

194
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 It's a car driving down the road and to all of my British listeners out there, suspend your giggles.

195
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Jason, I'm not going to laugh at all tonight after that last story. You want to sit here stone-faced.

196
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 A lot of people had a lot of fun with the... This is a true story. These are real names.

197
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So, no laughing at these incredibly traumatized men. We have... These are kind of funny names, okay?

198
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 His name is Willie Begay. Okay, that's a real name.

199
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Willie Begay. This is in the newspaper. This is an actual human being.

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Willie Begay, he was driving down the highway with his friend Guy Tossi.

201
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So, no one... No one chuckled at that one except for people in Britain.

202
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 If you don't know, in Britain, a Tossa is someone who masturbates in public.

203
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 So, you have two guys named one Willie Begay, you have the other guy Guy Tossi.

204
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 They're driving on the road. They're dead silent. They don't like to talk to each other.

205
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They both know that their names are odd, to say the least, but before they couldn't make fun of each other's names,

206
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 all of a sudden there is a flash of light in the distance.

207
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And then they see a small disc appear, a typical flying saucer, with a clear dome on top of it.

208
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And they can look right into the dome. This is real old school saucer stories, right?

209
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Nowadays we don't see this as much, but back then you would see these stories that would have the clear dome.

210
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And in the clear dome they could see two aliens.

211
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They said that the UFO at this point was fairly close to the car, like the bright flash of light appears.

212
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Now this UFO is right next to their car, it's right in front of them.

213
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's about five feet off the ground and when it appeared, Willie's car came to a complete stop.

214
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 The dome of the UFO...

215
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 opens up.

216
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And one of the aliens floats out.

217
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's landing on the cold pavement, cold Riri Idaho street.

218
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 This little dude, he was three and a half feet tall.

219
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He was like, Jason, I haven't had such a hard time concentrating on this story.

220
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I'm still thinking about the last one, I'm having a hard time telling this story honestly.

221
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I'm about to read you the description of this funny alien and you're like...

222
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You just got to sit in there, sit in there in the dark, oh man, what a bad combination of stories.

223
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But let's keep going.

224
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 The little alien's like shrugging, he's like, seriously bro, you're doing this story?

225
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 That last one was so depressing and it didn't get better for her, but it could, it can get better.

226
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 One of the aliens floats out, he's three and a half feet tall.

227
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 His face is all scarred up.

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Well, this is the description that these two men gave.

229
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 They said the face of this alien either looked heavily scarred or lumpy.

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So we're not talking about a traditional gray alien.

231
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 That's one thing that is almost universal among them is their smooth looking skin.

232
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 When you touch them, it's a very rough feeling, but smooth looking skin.

233
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They said this alien floated down, deeply scarred face, big ears, big round eyeballs.

234
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 No nose or lips, that is typical of a gray alien.

235
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And a deep chest, I don't know exactly what that means, a broad chested?

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Or maybe it's like the chest is kind of concave.

237
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Anyways, a deep chest and had only two fingers on each hand.

238
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 They were wearing traditional alien clothing, we see this a lot.

239
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 They're wearing tight fitting overalls.

240
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 These aliens, because the second one's going to come out of here soon, both also have backpacks on.

241
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 The alien who came out of the ship first begins to move towards the car.

242
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And I'm wondering if it was floating still, if it actually walked, but it's moving towards the car.

243
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And without even pausing, this alien opened the car door and got inside.

244
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Now remember, there's already two people in the car, we got Willie and Guy.

245
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And this alien gets in the car and Willie just like, whatever, like you can take it, you can take it, you can take the steering wheel.

246
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And he scoots over so now Willie and Guy are both crammed up on the passenger seat together.

247
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And the alien grabs the steering wheel and the car begins to move forward.

248
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I've read several accounts of this story and generally it's accepted in all of them that the alien was not powering the car.

249
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Because as it was moving forward, the UFO was always about the same distance from the car.

250
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And the idea is that the UFO was towing the car, the alien just wanted to get inside.

251
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 They could just tow it around anyways, he wanted to get in the steering wheel.

252
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 At 3.5 feet, I don't know if you can even reach the gas pedals, but this alien's holding on the steering wheel and the UFO is pulling the car.

253
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Which would be alarming enough, right?

254
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But if it was continuing to pull you down the road, maybe you'd think, maybe they're going to take us home.

255
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 It's like if you got carjacked, right?

256
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And someone put a gun in your neck and said, "Scoot over, it's my turn."

257
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And they realized that he's only 3.5 feet tall with giant ears and they're like, "Oh, this is kind of weird carjacker."

258
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 If you got carjacked but he begins driving towards your neighborhood, you're like, "Oh, maybe he's going to drive me off in my house."

259
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And then he's going to rob my house, he's going to be like, "Ah, I shouldn't move where all your jewels are."

260
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And they're like, "Oh man."

261
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But imagine if you got carjacked and he didn't drive you back, you're like, "I don't care, I don't care where he's driving me."

262
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 "I'm driving me to the Museum of Modern Art."

263
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "I don't want to get carjacked, they're all terrifying."

264
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 But imagine if he passed the Museum of Modern Art, you're like, "Oh man, I had tickets for today."

265
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 He passes that and begins to drive you onto the middle of a field.

266
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 That's what I'm talking about. That would be way creepier.

267
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 If you got carjacked and he's like, "Turn left."

268
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And you're like, "There is no left."

269
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And then it's just a big empty field and there's like a swamp at the end of it.

270
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 With a spooky crow, you're like, "Oh no, not the crows."

271
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It'd be creepier.

272
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Well, that's what these aliens start doing.

273
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 They begin towing the car off of the highway.

274
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They're towing it into this field.

275
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And they get about 75 feet out of this field and guys like, "Nope, I'm out."

276
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Guys like, "I'm getting out."

277
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He jumps out of the car and just takes off running.

278
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 You know, it's 9.30 at night, it's probably pretty dark.

279
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He gets out, he starts running.

280
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He's running through the darkness and he just disappears.

281
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Not, I guess I should use a different term when I'm talking about aliens and things like that.

282
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 He doesn't dematerialize.

283
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Willie is still sitting in the car and he just sees his friend just run off into the darkness and then can't see him anymore.

284
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 There'd be another way to put that.

285
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Willie is still sitting there though and he's petrified.

286
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And he was so terrified about what was going on.

287
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 He goes, "The alien tried talking to me but I couldn't understand what he was saying."

288
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I mean, to be fair, that could also be that he's an alien.

289
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 The alien was talking to him.

290
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He said, "The alien had this really high-pitched voice, very rapid high-pitched voice, who he compared to a woman."

291
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 He goes, "Imagine if you were standing next to a woman and she was speaking normally, according to him."

292
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Women sound like they're high-pitched and they speak really quickly.

293
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 He's watched too many Doris Day movies.

294
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 He says, I've never even watched a Doris Day movie. I don't know where their reference came from.

295
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 He says they spoke in a really high-pitched, rapid fire voice.

296
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 He goes, "A woman or a bird is what he described it to."

297
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 The alien then, the alien was trying to talk to him and Willie can't make heads or tails of it.

298
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 So the alien jumps out of the car and the second alien then floats from the field.

299
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 He didn't see this one get out of the UFO, but now he sees this second alien kind of floating through the field that they got pulled into.

300
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Both of them floated back into the UFO, the hatch closed.

301
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And then he said, it appeared that fire.

302
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 The term he used was played like fire, like almost had a fiery, he didn't necessarily say it was fire, but it kind of moved like fire.

303
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 It kind of looked like fire, but he didn't feel that it was fire.

304
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 He says he saw this fire kind of appear from the bottom of the craft.

305
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And Willie could feel this rush of air kind of overtake him.

306
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Even though he's in the car, a window must have been rolled down.

307
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 The UFO then shoots up into the sky and it's gone.

308
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Let's switch viewpoints to Guy.

309
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He said he sprinted across the field.

310
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Remember that guy?

311
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Remember the guy who left his buddy there?

312
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in the car, he was in

313
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Probably the point where the alien gave up was when Guy got to a farmhouse.

314
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 He gets to a farmhouse and he's totally freaking out.

315
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 He didn't make any sense at all.

316
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 The farmer, a guy named Willard Hammond was just like, uh-huh.

317
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 He's loading his shotgun.

318
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 He's like, I don't know.

319
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I don't know what you hippies are doing.

320
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 He goes, me and my friend were driving.

321
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Our car got towed out in the middle of the field, but he's like talking about aliens too.

322
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I was like, what are you talking about?

323
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And he goes, I think my friend's dead.

324
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I'm pretty sure I left this dude in the car with this alien.

325
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 They were towing it out off the road.

326
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'm pretty sure my friend's dead.

327
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 He said that a couple of times, my friend's dead.

328
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 My friend's dead.

329
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 So Willard, let's Guy calm down.

330
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And then Guy Willard and Willard's son Bob.

331
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So let's go out and check on your dead friend.

332
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Let's go see what's going on.

333
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Because you would wonder, right?

334
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 You would think maybe there's a car accident.

335
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 That would be my guess.

336
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Actually, no.

337
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I'm a paranormal guy.

338
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Aliens, aliens.

339
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 But I think most people would go, there's probably a car accident.

340
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 This guy is a concussion.

341
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 His friend hopefully isn't dead, but let's go check out.

342
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 He goes, they went out there and sure enough, there is a car sitting in the middle of this field.

343
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And the motor's running.

344
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Even though the car had stopped earlier.

345
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 The motor's running, the headlights are on.

346
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And Willie was now no longer, so when he got pushed over by the alien,

347
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 he was basically like sitting where a center console would be in a modern car.

348
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 He's sitting right in there in the middle.

349
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 They're all crunched together.

350
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Willie is now back behind the steering wheel.

351
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 So after the aliens left, he inched back over and is behind the steering wheel.

352
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 But he's just sitting there with his eyes closed tightly.

353
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 As these three men approach, as Guy, Willard, and Bob are walking towards the car,

354
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 they see Willie just sitting there with his eyes closed as tight as he can.

355
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 And his whole body is just trembling.

356
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 The police were called out.

357
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 You'd probably want medical assistance for this guy, Willard and Bob, who weren't there.

358
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 They were probably who were still, I would still again think it was a car accident.

359
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 This car is all the way off the road.

360
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 This guy's obviously having some sort of trauma.

361
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 The police are called.

362
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And the police do log it as an unidentified flying object,

363
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 because what happens is the next day it gets reported on the radio,

364
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 turns out that other people had seen bizarre events as well.

365
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Which some of it you figure could be fake.

366
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 We do see things like this when there's a sighting in an area.

367
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Be it Bigfoot, UFO, even ghosts.

368
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Popular sighting people would be like, "Oh yeah, I saw something like that too."

369
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 They got a lot of reports like that.

370
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 But we also had reports of cattle stampede in the area.

371
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It should be kind of hard to fake, right?

372
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 It would be kind of hard to fake that there was a cattle stampede twice in the same night.

373
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 They broke out of their fenced in area,

374
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 and the owner had to go and get the cattle and brought them all back.

375
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 And he was like, "Okay, cows, don't do that again."

376
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And then they broke out again, and they ran amuck through the area.

377
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Eventually a UFO research group called NYCAP came in to investigate it.

378
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon.

379
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And they started cataloging all this stuff.

380
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 They treated it as a serious sighting.

381
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 There was another encounter that same evening.

382
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Apparently there was a guy driving a truck, and he saw a disc-shaped object.

383
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 An alien floated over to his car, tapped on his windshield, and he floored it.

384
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 He was out of there. He was out of there so fast. He didn't want anything to do with it.

385
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And the driver immediately thought he was crazy.

386
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Thought he was hallucinating the whole thing.

387
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And the reason why I include that in the more serious, more realistic encounters,

388
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 not just like the fake ones, is that he didn't tell anyone about it.

389
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 He didn't tell anyone about it. What happened was the next day, he was sitting with his friend,

390
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 and they were listening to the radio, and they played this story about the two guys

391
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 and the aliens coming into the car off.

392
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And the friend said, "I looked at my buddy, and he just went completely white."

393
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And I go, "Dude, what's the matter? Why all of a sudden did you lose all the color in your face?"

394
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And the buddy goes, "That happened to me last night, too."

395
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But I thought it was crazy. I didn't tell anyone about it. I thought it was nuts.

396
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Who's going to believe me that this alien came down?

397
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I didn't tell anyone. I thought I was crazy. What would I tell that I'm crazy?

398
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 So it wasn't him. See, it wasn't him making the story of his friend saw him get terrified.

399
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 That he wasn't crazy. That this was real.

400
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 It's an interesting story, and it makes so much sense.

401
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 It makes so much sense, because here's the thing.

402
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Just because you have super advanced technology.

403
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Let's assume that these aliens work in a totally massacre of these two guys,

404
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 and we're pulling them off the side of the road to vaporize them, right?

405
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Because that's definitely possible. Aliens have been known to do that.

406
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 The alien getting in the car. The alien getting in the car and pushing the guy's side.

407
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 I don't think he had to push him aside. I think he just got in the car and the other guy moved,

408
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 because he wants to sit next to a little alien. I probably would.

409
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Get him a chokehold. Get him a chokehold.

410
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 But it would totally make sense for an alien to want to drive a car.

411
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 We still ride in horse drawn carriages, even though our technology is so far advanced past that.

412
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 We still find the charm in it.

413
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You have people who are like, "Hey, you want some butter?"

414
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And I was like, "Oh, yeah, dude. Maybe some pancakes or some toast to go along with it?"

415
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Normally, I don't just sit around and eat butter.

416
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 So, give me some pancakes, and they give me some pancakes, and then they're like,

417
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 "You want some butter?" And I go, "Yeah, sure."

418
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 And then they start churning it. And I'm like, "Oh my God, wow. How long is this going to take?"

419
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 So the summer solstice?

420
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Like, there is a charm in old technology.

421
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 "Hey, you want some ice cream? You want some ice cream?

422
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 I see that you haven't eaten those pancakes yet. No butter."

423
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 "Yeah, sure. I'll take some ice cream."

424
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 They start hand churning the ice cream.

425
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 There's a charm to it.

426
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 So it wouldn't make sense.

427
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Like, just because you have a hyperdrive, just because you have these UFOs that can fly around,

428
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 doesn't mean if you saw a 69 Chevy, you wouldn't want to take it for a ride.

429
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 There's people today who drive 69 Chevys, and they love it.

430
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 They love the feel of it. They love the seatbelts that will cut you in two if you ever get rear-ended.

431
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 They love driving around pure Detroit steel, running onto civics off the road,

432
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 watching the plastic crumple, like tissue paper.

433
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 So it would totally make sense.

434
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 It would not be outside the realm of possibility,

435
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 because a lot of stuff, when we look at alien phenomenon, we can look at ourselves and go,

436
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 "We would do that. We would do that."

437
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 We do constantly observe other animals and in the course of observing them, kill them.

438
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 So all the scientific experiments aliens have been known to do on humans,

439
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 that's not unusual to what humans do.

440
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 We tag animals that we've studied and we see aliens do that.

441
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 We've interfered in other cultures. Aliens do that.

442
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 We're explorers. We're always looking for what's beyond the horizon. Aliens do that.

443
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 So why not a joyride?

444
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Why wouldn't they want to get in some old beat-up car?

445
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Well, back then it was brand new, right?

446
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 But to an alien, how fascinating would that be to sit on a vinyl seat and grab the steering wheel?

447
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 People still use old-school pocket watches.

448
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 It's a fascinating alien story.

449
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It's borders on that mundane.

450
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 It's almost as mundane as you can get with an alien story,

451
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 because aliens are always so super fantastical.

452
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 So you guys know me. I love those kind of mundane slice-of-life stories.

453
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And this is pretty close to it.

454
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 An alien wanted to drive your car. No matter if you were driving it before.

455
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 An alien wanted to get in that car, take it for a joyride.

456
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Now again, it is possible they were also going to kill these two humans,

457
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 because that one guy did get chased.

458
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 I can't say that these aliens were totally innocent, but...

459
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 If they just wanted a joyride, aliens of the universe, you are welcome.

460
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 I'm gonna speak for all of you, man.

461
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And you're like, "No, Jason, don't do it."

462
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Aliens of the universe, if all you want to do is drive around in our cars

463
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 and play with human yo-yos and go ice skating, be my guest.

464
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Literally be my guest. You can all hang out at my house.

465
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 If that's all you want to do, that's dope.

466
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 The moral of the story, I guess, is that even though technology is old, it's still fun to use.

467
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And I think that's another thing that just links up humans and aliens.

468
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 We have more similarities than we have differences, and hopefully that will help us.

469
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 If they ever come to invade, hopefully they will go, "Ah, we're all the same inside."

470
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Well, not technically. We have different organs in different places,

471
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 but we all like driving classic cars.

472
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:38,000
