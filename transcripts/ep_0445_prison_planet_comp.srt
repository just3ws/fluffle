1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 Is it a man, a ghost, or a monster that stalked a Swiss force?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,200
 And then we look at a man who believes that humans did not evolve on Earth.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,440
 It doesn't make sense why we're on this planet.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,200
 Unless we were put here because Earth is our prison today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,600
 [Music]

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,440
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,400
 First off, I wanted to say a shout out to, again, we got a lot of new patrons this week today.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,960
 It's Nicole Girard.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
 Nicole Girard, I don't know if your name is pronounced that way,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
 but I don't know how most of this pronounced.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,120
 Nicole is actually the fiance of Corey, who was our Patreon supporter yesterday.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
 So that's beautiful, right?

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,760
 Our first Patreon couple. Really, really appreciate it.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
 Let's go ahead and get started.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,280
 Nicole, you know what? Your fiance got to fly the Carpenter copter.

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
 You'll get to fly the Carpenter copter too,

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
 but first off, we're going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
 That is a beautiful vehicle.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,440
 We're going to see how you are behind the wheel.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,320
 We're driving out to Switzerland.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,160
 Little wooden people come out of clocks and stuff like that over there.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,800
 And the shoes, they got the wooden shoes.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
 I think that might be Dutch.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,880
 Cuckoo clocks are from Switzerland, right?

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
 There's that famous quote about how...

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,040
 I don't remember the quote ended with cuckoo clocks.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
 Anyways, a bunch of cuckoo clocks.

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
 We're driving around.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,080
 We're going to Switzerland.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,320
 Now, specifically, we're going to a place called the Molls, woods, the Mollays, woods.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,840
 So you're awfully sad there, or you're sad that I mispronounced that.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
 And this is actually a recommendation from Crows on Twitter.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,720
 I saw this on Crows feed, so I thought it was a really interesting story.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,280
 We're headed out to the woods of Mollays.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,120
 Now, for a long time, people in town surrounding the woods would come home from work.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,160
 Oh, you won't believe the day I just had it work.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
 It totally sucked.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,440
 I was like, there, I worked at a call center.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
 It was customer support for cuckoo clocks.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
 It was horrible.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
 But on my way home from work, because I don't work in the forest,

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,080
 but some have to tie this together.

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,880
 I don't know why I started the story off with them coming up from work.

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,560
 But to get home from work, I have to walk through this forest.

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,680
 I saw him.

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,720
 "Who did you see, honey?"

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,080
 Wife says.

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,240
 You won't believe it.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,960
 It was a giant man, giant man.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,720
 And he was dressed up like an army dude.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
 This guy really has a way with words.

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
 Definitely not a literature major.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,840
 He was a giant man.

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
 He was dressed up like an army dude.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,040
 He had on this long camouflage cloak.

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
 Oh my, I know.

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,120
 It's pretty spooky.

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
 And then he turned around and he was wearing a gas mask.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,840
 And I ran away and I came home.

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
 And I complained about my job first before telling you that horrifying story.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
 Now, he's known as Le Loyon.

66
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,320
 Le Loyon.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,560
 And for 10 years, this man inhabited the woods of Mauls.

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,560
 They called him Le Loyon, which means the ghost of Mauls, which that does not mean that.

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
 Listen, I know that English, a lot of people think the language of English is clunky.

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,680
 But how do two words, Le Loyon, mean four words, the ghost of Mauls?

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 Even though I can understand like you can have like two words like Le Lorn, Le Lornlia,

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,720
 Le Lornia, you know the Spanish ghost that like pushes babies into water and yells at you.

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
 Like I think her name means like the woman in white, right?

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
 So technically that's three, like Le, I get the.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
 But how does Loyon mean ghost of Mauls?

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
 That doesn't make sense.

77
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 What part of that is ghost?

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,760
 Is it the low part?

79
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
 Is it the yon part?

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,040
 Anyways, it's weird old language.

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
 What are they speaking Swiss?

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
 What's languages?

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,840
 And is it just like, Swissese?

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,080
 Anyways, Le Loyon meaning the ghost of Mauls, which actually sounds like a

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
 heck you saying it.

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,360
 And I'm thinking it's like a shopping mall and he's like,

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
 come to Hot Topic two for one.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,760
 So anyways, people in town were like, oh dude, look out for this guy.

89
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,600
 People did not know what he was.

90
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
 I mean, they knew he was real.

91
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
 He was six foot two feet tall.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
 He wasn't considered a ghost.

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
 He was considered more along the lines of an urban legend like Joe Trombone or

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
 something like that.

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
 There's some weird urban legend.

96
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 But people were calling the police on him.

97
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,000
 They're like, dude, this big old giant weirdo is walking around.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
 He's dressed up like a military guy.

99
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,280
 I don't know if he's insane or what.

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
 I mean, he's just go investigate.

101
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,160
 He's just going.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
 I don't need a reason to call the police.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
 Just go investigate this giant man walking around dressing up like,

104
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,320
 he would do it all the time.

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,360
 People saw him all the time.

106
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,480
 Sometimes he'd be carrying flowers, which is weird.

107
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,480
 Now he never said or interacted with anyone in a menacing way.

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,760
 Just say local legend.

109
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,320
 But what happened was at a certain point, the media got a hold of it.

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
 Le Martin.

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,560
 It's a paper.

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
 It's a newspaper in Switzerland.

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,280
 September 2013, they posted a photograph.

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,120
 I don't know why I said it like that.

115
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
 They posted a photograph of him from behind.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
 Someone had happened to pull out their camera and take a picture.

117
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
 Now he was first spotted in 2003.

118
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
 Now it's 2013.

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
 It's no longer an urban legend.

120
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
 There's actually photos of this guy.

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
 We covered a guy like that, the cat man.

122
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,400
 He was in Scotland that you had Aki who was sexually harassing people in Britain,

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
 where it's like people in the area see these guys.

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,880
 And then all of a sudden it's like, it becomes a national thing.

125
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
 It goes from being a local legend that only a few people leave into this big thing.

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,240
 So now his pictures in the newspaper, people are now, before people would avoid him,

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
 they'd see him, "Oh, let's get out of here."

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
 They'd leave.

129
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,600
 But now that he is a nationwide urban legend, people are going to the forest specifically to see him.

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,880
 They begin hunting him.

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
 They want proof.

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
 They want a photograph.

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 They want to find out the story behind this guy.

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
 That was published in September 2013.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
 The last sighting of him was only two months later, November 2013.

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,880
 After that, he isn't seen again, but they do find his equipment.

137
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,960
 So there's a little rock and lay next to it was a gas mask, his cloak, and a letter

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,400
 that accused Lay Martin of murdering a quote, "Very harmless being."

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
 Because they revealed he existed.

140
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,760
 He wrote down, "The risk of a beast hunt has made this all too dangerous."

141
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,880
 The newspaper actually responded to that allegation.

142
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,040
 They said, "We didn't murder him. He committed suicide.

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,560
 He could have continued to be this suit walking around.

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
 We're just reporting this story."

145
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
 But the mystery is over now.

146
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,600
 Some people believe he actually physically committed suicide.

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,320
 He killed himself.

148
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
 And he left the message behind.

149
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,840
 Other people said that he simply killed off the character of Leiloyne and went back to a normal life.

150
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
 But to this day, nobody knows who was in the suit or what happened to him.

151
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,120
 Most likely, it was some sort of peaceful meditation, isolation thing going on.

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
 Some people thought it was a fetish, which it could have been a fetish too, but never did anything

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
 to hurt anyone.

154
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,840
 People who had encountered him said he made them feel like not welcome or menacing.

155
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,600
 But it was like, here's a quote from one.

156
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
 It was a rainy Sunday day.

157
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,640
 He had a cap, a dark cloak, and a gas mask.

158
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,800
 What could possibly be going through his head?

159
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,520
 I don't know.

160
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,640
 But it was unforgettable and unpleasant.

161
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,560
 I hope I don't run into him ever again.

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
 That was a quote from someone who ran into him.

163
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,160
 But nothing that character did, nothing Leiloyne did, actually intimidated this person.

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 So it's possible that this was a way of dealing with some sort of existential crisis

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
 and made him feel comfortable, whatever.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
 It's weird.

167
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,680
 Don't get me wrong.

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
 It's totally bizarre.

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,120
 But when he was exposed and now being hunted, he's just like, "Now I got to take this off."

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
 And I would argue that the newspaper did murder him.

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
 Like, that's saying, the newspaper saying, "We didn't murder you.

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,640
 You committed suicide."

173
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,920
 Like, we simply reported it.

174
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,280
 You're the one who chose to take the action.

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,200
 It would be the same thing if a newspaper like outed someone, if you were in the closet,

176
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,400
 you're a gay dude and you're in the closet and the newspaper outs you and then you kill yourself.

177
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 Is the newspaper responsible?

178
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,360
 Well, I would say yeah.

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
 Because you were living, he was a private citizen living a private life.

180
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,840
 And then the newspaper published it.

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,880
 But you know, your mileage may vary because again, he was a weirdo walking around the woods.

182
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,960
 I, and to be fair, I have covered weirdos walking around.

183
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,960
 So, well maybe someday someone will quit being a weirdo because of this show.

184
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,480
 Who knows?

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,680
 And then I'll change my tune because I'm a total immigrant and I'll be like, "What?"

186
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,520
 Hey, I didn't murder him.

187
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,560
 He committed suicide.

188
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
 You're like, "No, Jason, you did murder him."

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
 Remember, you're on trial for his murder.

190
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
 I was like, "Oh yeah."

191
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

192
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,240
 I'm going to have Nicole and Corey break me out of jail here.

193
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
 So, Corey's like watching for the guards.

194
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
 He's ready to crowd chop him.

195
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
 Nicole's like picking the locks.

196
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
 Yeah, no one, no prison can keep me.

197
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,400
 As long as I have people on the outside to break me out.

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
 Calling that carpenter copter Nicole, we are breaking out of this fictional prison I'm in

199
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
 for killing one of my listeners.

200
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,040
 We are flying out to the world.

201
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
 This whole story involves the whole planet.

202
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
 So just, just being sub-orbit, we're going to float around.

203
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,520
 Let's talk a little bit about a man who has even more bizarre evolutionary theories

204
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,240
 than your dear host, Jason Carpenter.

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,560
 There's a man known as Dr. Ellis Silver.

206
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,520
 He's an ecologist and he has a theory that humans did not evolve on the planet Earth.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,440
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,560
 We were placed here.

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,600
 Now that's actually not a bizarre, it's a bizarre theory, but it's not a rare theory.

210
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
 Some people may think of it as panspermia, which is life was seeded throughout the universe,

211
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
 landed on random planets.

212
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,120
 That's pretty, that's not super out there as far as theories go.

213
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
 When you start talking about aliens dropping people off, that makes it a little weirder.

214
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,920
 His theory specifically is that humans were put here as a punishment, that we live on a prison

215
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,040
 planet, planet we're not supposed to be able to escape from.

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
 Now he has a couple different theories of where we come from.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,400
 Some, sometimes he says we're from Mars, sometimes he says we're from much farther off,

218
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,600
 but he believes that the humans have only been here for maybe 60,000 years,

219
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,840
 maybe a little bit longer, but around 60,000 years.

220
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,640
 And here is his proof.

221
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,480
 Now he has a couple different theories, but one is that the UFOs are basically the Wardens.

222
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
 The UFOs are a real phenomenon and they're aliens making sure we don't get too uppity.

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,000
 Make sure we don't try to leave in the planet, make sure we don't blow each other up.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,920
 Just like prison wardens don't want the prisoners to kill everybody in the prison.

225
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,520
 You know, it's a prison, but you want to have some sense of civilization.

226
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,120
 He also says that we may have escaped here, this may have just been the first, like we

227
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
 were still prisoners, but we escaped here.

228
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,760
 We got stuck here, or that we had a planet that was going to blow up all the Krypton,

229
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,280
 we ended up here, stuff like that.

230
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,120
 He also has a theory that he basically, he's hedging his bets, right?

231
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
 He's just basically pulling stuff out of his butt.

232
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,040
 He says it's possible the aliens came down here, banged the animals, and then made us.

233
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,720
 So we're not technically 100% alien, we're like half alien, we're like that girl from

234
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
 Out of This World, that old show.

235
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
 She put her fingers together, bing!

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
 Everything would freeze.

237
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,320
 What was her name?

238
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,280
 It was like Edie or Kebe or Zini,

239
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,840
 Hebe, whatever.

240
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,680
 That was a good show, I doubt it holds up, but that, I used to watch that, I used to watch

241
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,720
 Small Wonder.

242
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,080
 Has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

243
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,520
 The point is, this is his argument for why we're not supposed to be here.

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,320
 We're the smartest creatures on the planet.

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
 We have thought processes.

246
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,120
 We're so different than all the other animals on the planet.

247
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,000
 Now, let me back up here.

248
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
 I'm not making these arguments myself.

249
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,400
 I'm making these arguments on behalf of him.

250
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,920
 But I do believe humans are smartest.

251
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,720
 But anyways, as we go further, I'm disavowing these just out of, out of, out of caution.

252
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
 So anyways, he believes that we're so far above any other species as far as intelligence goes,

253
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,280
 that it makes us feel like we're the aliens on a planet.

254
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,720
 So his idea is that bananas and puffer fish and sand worms or whatever, apparently we're now on

255
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,360
 that doom planet, Arrakis.

256
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
 Every living thing on this planet is not, we're not related to, even though we share

257
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,400
 similar DNA, we're not related to it.

258
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,680
 We're from another place.

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
 So we're too smart to be here with all these dummies.

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,840
 Two, childbirth is extremely complicated.

261
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,160
 Most animals, they just kind of walk and then a baby falls out of them.

262
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,480
 But with humans, the baby can die, the mother can die, both can die.

263
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,840
 It's very dangerous.

264
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,360
 The head is pretty big.

265
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,240
 And he goes, if we evolved, because you know, basically our heads got bigger, the smarter we got

266
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
 to make more room for our brains.

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,960
 If the baby, if the women should have evolved to basically, the women should have been getting

268
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,440
 wider and wider hips, so babies just be falling out of them.

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
 It shouldn't be such a push to push out that brain.

270
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
 If people were evolving, it should evolve on the same rate.

271
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,960
 Now, I think that one is, I think the first one, yeah, I do think humans are smarter than all

272
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,440
 other animals.

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
 I don't really think anyone goes, well, no, if you look at crabgrass, that's way,

274
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,200
 I don't think anyone really, you can say like birds and whales are pretty smart, but I don't

275
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
 think anyone's, they're like smartest two-year-olds and stuff like that.

276
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,280
 And those people are idiots.

277
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,160
 Little babies coming out of you, I think the reason why women don't have like massive

278
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
 birth canals is because dudes aren't banging women with massive birth canals.

279
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
 That's my pushback on that one.

280
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,000
 That dudes tend to bang like thin chicks, and then thin chicks give birth to thin like little,

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,280
 little baby people, right?

282
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,640
 Like, I mean, they're not coming out like spaghetti noodles, but you know what I mean?

283
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,040
 Like, it's evolution.

284
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
 Yes, he's right.

285
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,000
 Evolution should push women to be able to give birth to children very, very easily, but men,

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,280
 even back in the day, men preferred to bang not like Twiggy, not like super, that's an

287
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,440
 old reference, but not like super skinny chicks.

288
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,600
 I mean, they weren't banging the caveman equivalent of Taylor Swift, but they weren't,

289
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
 they weren't that far off, right?

290
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,240
 So, I think that's part of that.

291
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
 I think that you're right.

292
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,800
 I think it should have evolved to that, but men are still, they have a body type,

293
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,000
 and come heller high water, that's where they're attracted to, even if it may result in the

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
 slowing down of the human species.

295
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 So, that's my personal theory, and you're like, again, shaking your head, you're like,

296
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,240
 "Ugh, you and your personal theories."

297
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,120
 I think that's true though.

298
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,480
 I think the reason why women don't have super wide hips so that like a nine pound baby could

299
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
 come out breach is because they're not banging women with super wide hips.

300
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
 But anyways, number three is about the big heads.

301
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
 I'm not going to go more into that.

302
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
 But they do say that human babies spend a long time helpless as opposed to other animals.

303
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,160
 A lot of times, like an elephant's just walking, the baby elephant just falls out and just

304
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
 starts walking behind it, still covered in goop.

305
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,000
 And Bilko Kord's still hanging out, after birth, spilling out.

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,840
 They just keep on moving, dude.

307
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,880
 You don't even know, the mom was like, "Oh, I feel like I just lost 20 pounds.

308
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,080
 That keto is really working."

309
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,760
 And it looks behind and is like, "Oh, I just gave birth."

310
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,280
 So, but a human baby just lays there for like pretty much 18 years at this point, and then

311
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,080
 finally like, "Ah, need to go get a job."

312
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,480
 So, long period of helplessness.

313
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:46,960
 Also, most animals can see and hear a wider range of stuff, like ultraviolet lights,

314
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,200
 higher frequencies, lower frequencies.

315
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 His theory is that we're from a planet where there was no ultraviolet light, or we're like,

316
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
 it was just one light source maybe.

317
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
 I don't know, it's just a big giant light bulb in the middle of the planet.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,960
 And less sound.

319
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,160
 This is where he starts becoming a weirdo, and I'm going to stop defending him.

320
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,560
 But basically, they come from a place where there's only one spectrum of light, or a very

321
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,360
 limited spectrum of light, and a very limited hearing range.

322
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
 So, we're built for that.

323
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,440
 We come here, we can't hear, but if we could see ultraviolet, if we could hear different ranges,

324
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,320
 it'd probably help us.

325
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,840
 I think there's like this tiger that growl is like almost unheard of for us,

326
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,640
 but animals will scoot, stuff like that.

327
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
 We have hay fever and allergies, which is weird that we're allergic to our own planet,

328
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,600
 that we've evolved here alongside wheat and grass and dandelions and all that stuff,

329
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,640
 but it makes us sneeze.

330
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,440
 It makes us sick.

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
 That's what allergies are.

332
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
 It makes us sick.

333
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,560
 We're sniffling.

334
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,000
 Can you imagine a caveman trying to sneak up on a saber-toothed tiger in May?

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,120
 Oh, it's true!

336
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
 It doesn't work.

337
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,200
 It doesn't work.

338
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,520
 Also, humans tend to have back pain.

339
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
 That's like the number one cause of pain.

340
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,720
 I believe that's because of poor diet and lack of exercise.

341
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,480
 He believes it's because we come from a planet that has different gravity, right?

342
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,080
 So, we have a pretty high center of gravity and from the planet where originally 60,000 years

343
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,640
 isn't really enough to evolve from the planet that we're from.

344
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,040
 Wait a second now that I think about it, why does having skinny hips and giving birth to

345
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,360
 big head babies have to do with being an alien?

346
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,640
 That doesn't make sense.

347
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 I guess none of this really makes, you're like, Jason, that's the bar that doesn't make sense to you?

348
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,000
 Maybe on that planet, like, I don't know, your hips, like, could your legs could dislocate or

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,560
 something like that?

350
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:32,800
 I don't know.

351
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,640
 But anyways, he's saying that the reason why humans tend to have back pain is because we're

352
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
 from a planet that had different gravity.

353
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
 The reason why we have allergies or hay fever, any of that.

354
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
 I'm not talking about being allergic to shellfish.

355
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,960
 Actually, you know, that would be true too.

356
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
 Maybe that's the reason why people are allergic to peanuts.

357
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
 There are no peanuts on the home planet.

358
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
 But just having allergies, seasonal allergies, why are we allergic to our own planet?

359
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
 That's his argument.

360
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
 We don't eat uncooked foods.

361
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
 We don't like them, at least.

362
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
 I mean, we can eat them, but we don't like them.

363
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
 And he goes, that's a weird trait as well.

364
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,280
 Like, we've evolved to need to cook food.

365
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,480
 Even though that's pretty unnatural, you would have to have all throughout all of evolution,

366
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,680
 you're able to eat raw food with no problems whatsoever.

367
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,160
 You could take a squirrel, rip its tail off and just drink its guts.

368
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
 And you wouldn't have any problem getting disease.

369
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
 But now, if you, now you try that.

370
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,560
 Not only are the neighbors going to look down upon you,

371
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
 but you also will probably get incredibly sick.

372
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
 He goes, that doesn't make sense.

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,520
 We should be able to eat whatever we want,

374
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,320
 because a crocodile can walk up and eat whatever he wants.

375
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,440
 Why can't we?

376
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
 Now, it's funny because I've talked about this story a couple of times in real life.

377
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
 Kind of listed one or two of them and the people kind of chuckle.

378
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,000
 People are talking to you.

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
 Yeah, it's kind of funny.

380
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,080
 Yeah, it's kind of weird.

381
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
 And then I get to this last one and everyone goes, "Ugh."

382
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
 Or they make a look with their face.

383
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,160
 Every single time.

384
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,840
 I've talked to a couple of people about it.

385
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
 They go, "Ugh."

386
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
 Or if they're face to face, which is limited now under quarantine.

387
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
 But they go, "What?"

388
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,160
 So all of his argument, he sets it up well.

389
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
 Because at this point in the argument,

390
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,560
 you're like, "Ah, maybe that's true.

391
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,520
 That is weird.

392
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
 Women, white hips, short hips."

393
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
 And then you get to this.

394
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,880
 So he's sitting there and he's giving us this lecture.

395
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,920
 We're sitting in this room.

396
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,160
 Dr. Ellis Silver is like, "Yes."

397
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
 And you know the birth canals, we shouldn't be like this on alien planet.

398
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,240
 They should be different.

399
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,880
 We're like, "Ugh."

400
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
 And then he goes on and on.

401
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,240
 And he goes, "Well, another good reason,

402
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,360
 we know humans aren't supposed to be on the planet Earth

403
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
 is because humans get sunburned.

404
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
 So if you get a sunburn, that means you're probably an alien."

405
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
 Kind of looking at each other.

406
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,960
 We're like, "What?"

407
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
 He goes, "Yeah."

408
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,120
 Question in the back.

409
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,920
 We're like, "So you're saying that the fact that we get sunburned

410
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,760
 shows that we shouldn't be on this planet?"

411
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,400
 He goes, "Yeah, yeah.

412
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,920
 If you think about it, every other animal in the animal kingdom

413
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
 doesn't get sunburned.

414
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
 Like, a dog's out in the sun too long.

415
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
 It doesn't get burned."

416
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,800
 We're like, "Okay, wait.

417
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,720
 Are you saying that we raise my hand again?

418
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,040
 So are you implying, sir, that if you don't get sunburned,

419
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,920
 you are not human?"

420
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,640
 And he's like, "Correct.

421
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
 That is 100% what I'm implying.

422
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
 Only animals can be out in the sun all day long.

423
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,560
 But if you get a sunburn, that is a human trait.

424
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,400
 And that shows that humans are not from this planet."

425
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 And then we stop asking questions,

426
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,920
 but then we see some other guy raise a hand.

427
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,840
 He's like, "I'm black and I don't get sunburns.

428
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
 Are you implying that I'm some sort of animal?"

429
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,400
 And at that point, Dr. Silver kind of moves his collar.

430
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,360
 "Yawinks?

431
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,000
 Listen, I...

432
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,120
 Dude, I mean, like, everyone I told this to in real life,

433
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,040
 they're like, "That's kind of racist."

434
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,720
 And I was like, "Yeah, just a little bit, right?

435
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
 Just a little bit."

436
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
 I mean, basically, there's huge swaths of the human population

437
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
 that either don't get sunburned

438
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
 or have a much more difficult time getting sunburned

439
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
 just because of the pigmentation in their skin.

440
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,360
 But then, like any good grifter, he immediately changes...

441
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,240
 changes the subject before you can really think of it.

442
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
 Wait, did he just say that? Black people?

443
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

444
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:27,840
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

445
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
 That humans, when they look at the sun, they squint, animals don't...

446
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,560
 animals don't look at the sun.

447
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,600
 See, he...

448
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
 When's the last time you saw your dog being like,

449
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
 "What time is it and stare at the sun or talk for that matter?"

450
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,480
 The idea is...

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
 The idea is an interesting one.

452
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
 The idea is an interesting one that humans

453
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,520
 are a recent development on the planet.

454
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,040
 And to be fair, he does make some interesting points,

455
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,120
 i.e. the allergies one and the...

456
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
 What was the first one was?

457
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
 I already forgot it.

458
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,440
 Oh, the intelligence one.

459
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,600
 We're too smart and we're allergic to our own planet.

460
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
 Those are interesting ones.

461
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,560
 Everything else is just kind of a gobbly loop.

462
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,720
 Now, he's written two books on this subject.

463
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,040
 He's gotten some good reviews, gotten a lot of bad reviews.

464
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,160
 Usually, the bad reviews are focusing on science.

465
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,800
 Usually, the good reviews are focusing on no joke.

466
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,960
 Oh, dream this woman had.

467
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,520
 So, that's not really indicative of the quality of the book.

468
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,440
 Is this you had a dream that agreed with the book?

469
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,240
 But it's actually not a super...

470
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,800
 I think his arguments for it are pretty flawed.

471
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,480
 But I think there will always be a case that is made for humans to have been

472
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,600
 an incredibly late development in Earth's cycle.

473
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,120
 And when I say late, I mean, yes, probably coming from another planet.

474
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,680
 I don't think the fact that billions of people can't get sunburned

475
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,520
 is a proof that they're not human.

476
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,440
 I believe that if this story is true, we all would have come down at the same time.

477
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
 There's just too many similarities between us as a race, as a species,

478
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,440
 versus being able to chop up the genetic tree because one person

479
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,160
 can get a sunburn and the other person can't.

480
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,720
 That's kind of a weird division line.

481
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,040
 But there will be people who will push that angle.

482
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,800
 I think it is possible, though, that, I mean, knowing my theories on how evolution works,

483
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,480
 I definitely think it's an interesting way to look at things.

484
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,960
 Like humans did come down here, let's say 200,000, 500,000 years ago,

485
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
 from somewhere else.

486
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,680
 We just have so many creation myths that involve that.

487
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,320
 And we have so many stories today involving UFOs,

488
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,000
 that whether or not we came from another planet, another dimension,

489
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,400
 to me, to me it's less scientifically plausible than, say, evolution.

490
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,720
 But when you look at, well, I can't really give you an honest answer,

491
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,160
 I just think it's more fun.

492
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,920
 I think it's a more fun answer, right?

493
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,080
 I think it's more interesting.

494
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,000
 And I think that's probably what makes this type of stuff so appealing to people.

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,720
 Evolution, it's boring, it takes a lot of time and a lot of thought to really think about.

496
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
 And you've got to sit and sit in class and learn about vultures and turtles.

497
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,920
 You get bored.

498
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,000
 It's a lot easier to look up at the sky and think,

499
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
 no, maybe we came from out there.

500
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
 Maybe all of us came from out there.

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,240
 You say as you look over at Dr. Silver.

502
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
 It wasn't just the white people coming from space.

503
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,680
 I think it's a fun theory.

504
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,880
 I think it's a fun theory to think that we are from somewhere else,

505
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,800
 because what that implies is that there is something else out there.

506
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,120
 And whether or not we were put here as prisoners,

507
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
 it's kind of moot at this point.

508
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,760
 We've turned the Earth into a pretty cool place to hang out.

509
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,800
 But we'll see what happens if we do try to leave Earth permanently.

510
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,960
 Colonize the moon, colonize Mars, move farther past our solar system.

511
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
 Will we be stopped at that point?

512
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,960
 Will we then learn the truth that we actually are not Earthlings,

513
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
 but from someplace much more far off?

514
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,040
 However, Earth is where we will always be forced to stay.

515
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,600
