1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 A ghost, a terrifying specter from beyond the grave,

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,500
 on to Dennis' office in Germany.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then, every great villain has a great origin story.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,200
 Today we take a look at the origin story of Harvey Weinstein's penis,

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,700
 [music]

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,100
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,900
 Hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,100
 That's what I would normally say.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,800
 Dude, I just recorded.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,100
 Let's get real here for a second.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
 I just recorded- This is the second to last episode of season 13.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,700
 I recorded what might have been the cringiest episode I've ever recorded.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,700
 I spent a good 30, 40 minutes in the haunted closet.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
 It's a great recording space.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
 It's not very comfortable.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's cramped. It's hot.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
 There's a ghost in here.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,700
 There's a literal ghost in here.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,600
 It was so bad.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,800
 The episode was so terrible.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,400
 35, 40 minutes, two stories.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,000
 The- The Patreon supporter was a cookie at some point.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,900
 I mean, it was a full episode, but then I had a- It was bad.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,200
 It was so bad.

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,700
 And I had to scrap it.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,000
 And now I'm starting over from scratch.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
 This is a daily show, and it's just one dude.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,100
 You guys helped me financially.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,200
 You guys helped me finding stories.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
 So I never want to discount that.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
 The recording process, the editing process, it's just one guy.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,400
 So for me to waste a half hour in a haunted closet,

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,900
 for me to give the ghost an extra half hour to try to possess me,

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,400
 and other than that, it'd be in 90 degrees in here.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
 But why am I telling you this?

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,900
 Am I just crying?

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,500
 Because I'm about to introduce our Patreon supporter.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,600
 I'm probably introducing him as a cookie again.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,100
 The reason why I'm telling you guys this is that I want you guys to think about what you're doing.

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're bringing it back to this.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Yes, the 90-day challenge.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,900
 The 90-day challenge.

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
 I'm going to take two weeks off.

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,200
 I'm going to rest.

47
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,700
 I'm going to play State of Decay 2.

48
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
 I'm going to rejuvenate myself.

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,300
 I'm going to go in one of those chambers from Wanted and get healed.

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,100
 That's a- That's a reference that like three people get the actor in the movies like,

51
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
 "What? I don't even get the reference."

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,300
 But when I come back in two weeks,

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,800
 I want you guys.

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
 I know we're doing 90 days to a better you,

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
 but when I come back in two weeks,

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,700
 I want to get inundated with emails from you guys,

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,200
 not during my vacation, not during my vacation.

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,400
 But after my vacation, I want to get emails from you guys

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
 telling me how successful the last two weeks have been.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
 Even if it's just baby steps.

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,300
 Even if it's just baby steps.

62
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,700
 Because life's about moving forward.

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
 Life's about getting better.

64
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,900
 And I can almost guarantee- No, I'm not going to make that guarantee.

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,800
 That episode I recorded that was super cringy,

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
 it honestly was probably better than some of my early episodes.

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,700
 Uh...

68
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,500
 I don't know.

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,200
 But what we're going to do

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,300
 to show growth

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,400
 is I'm going to hang on to that cringy episode.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
 And I'm going to play it at the end of season 14.

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
 We're going to play- We're going to play this-

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,900
 Like, I don't want to hear that terrible episode.

75
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
 I definitely don't want to hear 50 episodes from now.

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
 We're going to play it at the end of season 14.

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,700
 Because it's all about growth, man.

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,400
 I can guarantee you that this episode I'm about to record right now.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,700
 Looking back at the end of season 14, I will think this episode could be better.

80
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,800
 I will think this episode wasn't good enough.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 Right now, it's the best episode I can produce.

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,400
 I definitely the best episode I can produce today

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,800
 because I just did a whole episode.

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,700
 But you know what I mean?

85
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,400
 You only get better by doing

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
 and sometimes you only get better by failing.

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,400
 But you can't even fail if you don't try.

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 Don't try.

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
 You won't fail.

90
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
 And if you don't fail, you won't get better.

91
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,900
 So take- Maybe this is making-

92
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,300
 Maybe this is the worst motivational speech ever.

93
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,500
 Maybe I'm a coach and all the players are looking at each other.

94
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,900
 They're like, "What? You're telling us to lose the game?"

95
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,700
 And then 50 episodes from now,

96
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,000
 you want us to watch us losing the game?

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
 Maybe it's not making sense.

98
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
 Maybe the heat is getting to me.

99
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,800
 But what I'm saying is,

100
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,100
 sometimes you're going to fail.

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,700
 Don't be afraid to fail.

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 Don't be afraid.

103
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,300
 You're like, "Jason, that's such an original thought.

104
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
 I've never heard that before."

105
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500
 But don't.

106
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 Don't do that.

107
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,100
 Don't do that.

108
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,000
 Maybe I'm just rationalizing the fact that I just wasted 35 minutes

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
 coming into Dead Ravica-

110
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
 (laughs)

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 Coming into Dead Ravica Man right now.

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,500
 Is there a Patreon supporter?

113
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,900
 It's T-Mad.

114
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,500
 He's a cookie.

115
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,300
 He's rolling in.

116
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,000
 He's a giant- No.

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
 In the other episode, he was half human, half cookie.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,300
 T-Mad, you're half human, half cookie.

119
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
 The upper half of your body will be a cookie

120
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
 and you've got your legs walking around,

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,500
 but then half an else, you're just human legs and a cookie.

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

123
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,400
 T-Mad is not only a Patreon supporter.

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
 He actually supported my Thanksgiving livestream

125
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,300
 by doing a donation.

126
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
 That's another way you can financially support the show.

127
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,600
 But if you guys can't financially support the show,

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
 I say this every episode on Amina from the bottom of my heart.

129
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,100
 That's fine.

130
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,700
 You don't have to financially support the episode.

131
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,100
 I get it.

132
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,600
 Not everyone can financially support shows.

133
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,000
 But if you're not doing that,

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,900
 spread the word about the show.

135
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,200
 Start threads on Reddit.

136
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,900
 What other stuff can you do online?

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,200
 Talk about it in forums.

138
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,700
 Talk about it in real life as well,

139
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,800
 but the internet is our oyster.

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
 Spread the word of Dead Rabbit Radio all through the internet.

141
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,900
 That's a long introduction.

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
 Been a long day, but I hope you guys are still with me

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
 because we got a lot of interesting stuff.

144
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,100
 T-Mad, the Cookie Man.

145
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,600
 We're going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

147
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,700
 We are headed out to Germany.

148
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,500
 Splush.

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
 Splush.

150
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,700
 We're going.

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,200
 The water is making T-Mad all soggy.

152
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,000
 That was a joke from the first draft to do.

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,900
 He got soggy and he gave a soggy job into a cookie.

154
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
 And I started eating him.

155
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,200
 It was weird.

156
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,600
 It was a weird episode.

157
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,100
 It was super weird.

158
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,700
 But anyways, don't be afraid to fail.

159
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,400
 You can't fail if you don't try.

160
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
 And if you don't try and don't fail,

161
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,900
 you won't succeed, whatever.

162
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,500
 We're in Germany.

163
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600
 T-Mad's like, "I'm out."

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 T-Mad is walking.

165
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,100
 He's going to go get some Bratzwurst.

166
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,300
 And he's going to pronounce it correctly.

167
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,500
 He's also going to get some pretzels.

168
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,600
 We're walking around Germany.

169
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
 And it is the year 1981.

170
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,300
 It's summer.

171
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,300
 It's nice, hot summer in Newtribling.

172
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,100
 That's in Regensburg in Germany.

173
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,300
 There's a little dentist office.

174
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,400
 And it's operated by dentist Kurt Batscheitz.

175
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'm pretty sure that's not how you pronounce that either.

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,200
 But dentist Kurt, Dr. Kurt, one day,

177
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,900
 he's on the phone, patients making an appointment.

178
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,100
 Yeah, dude, I need my teeth pulled out.

179
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
 Doctors like, "That's what I'm here for."

180
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,900
 And as they're having the conversation,

181
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
 "Hey, dummy."

182
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,600
 Dr. Kurt's like, "Did you just call me a dummy?"

183
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,300
 And the patient's like, "No, I didn't say anything.

184
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,700
 I didn't hear anything."

185
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
 "Hey, dummy, you big old galoot.

186
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
 I'm going to punch you in the nose."

187
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
 He's like, "What in the world?"

188
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,100
 Hangs up.

189
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
 He's like, "That's super rude patient.

190
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,600
 I'm going to pull out extra teeth on him.

191
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,900
 I'm going to put baby teeth in him and pull him out.

192
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
 That'll show him to make fun of me."

193
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,100
 But over the next couple weeks,

194
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,400
 when Dr. Kurt would be on the phone,

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
 "Hey, you have a funny last name.

196
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
 It sounds weird.

197
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,500
 Burt Schietz."

198
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,900
 He's like, "That's not how you pronounce my name."

199
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
 He's hearing this stuff all the time.

200
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,900
 "You doom cough.

201
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,400
 You smell like cottage cheese."

202
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,100
 Now, you might think I'm making these up and I am,

203
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,800
 but you might think I'm making up intentionally bad insults.

204
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,100
 These insults were not very clever.

205
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
 He was told that he was pooping his pants.

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,900
 He was told, "What was one of them?"

207
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,000
 "I had never heard anyone insulted like this."

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,600
 They called him a Prussian croissant.

209
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
 Maybe that's a real cutting insult in Germany in 1981,

210
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,900
 but otherwise it's just kind of puzzling and makes me hungry.

211
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,500
 Dr. Kurt is getting all of these bizarre childlike insults,

212
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
 throwing at him while he's on the phone.

213
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,400
 So Dr. Kurt calls the police and says,

214
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,300
 "Hey, someone I think is intercepting my phone line.

215
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,100
 I hear these voices when I'm on the phone.

216
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,300
 It's not a voice that I'm making."

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,700
 And the cops test it out and they start getting insulted.

218
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,500
 So the cops, you know, they're police officers.

219
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,600
 They can like arrest people, but you can't arrest a phone.

220
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
 You can arrest the person on the phone,

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 but they have to find them first.

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
 They actually are trying to figure out

223
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
 who could be making these phone calls.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And it's always, they would be calling someone else

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 and a voice wouldn't interrupt them.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,300
 So they end up calling the local utility company.

227
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,500
 They're testing all the lines.

228
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
 They can't figure out what it is.

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,200
 They replace every single phone line

230
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
 leading into the dentist's office.

231
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They're still getting the voice.

232
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 They start setting up these things called technical traps

233
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
 to try to figure where the signal is coming from.

234
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,000
 They're still getting the voice and they can't figure it out.

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,300
 So at this point, everyone is in agreement

236
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,900
 that this is most likely a poltergeist.

237
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,100
 This is most likely a ghost.

238
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,900
 And this, I should have said this earlier.

239
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,300
 I should have said this earlier.

240
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,900
 This voice refers to itself as chopper.

241
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,900
 I'm chopper and you stink, it said.

242
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,100
 And so they think it's this ghost named chopper,

243
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,800
 which is admittedly a pretty badass name, right?

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,900
 If you're going to be a ghost,

245
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,700
 it's way better than Casper or Slimer.

246
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,700
 So chopper is doing all this stuff now eventually,

247
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
 and we've seen this before in paranormal reports.

248
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,200
 The power gets stronger.

249
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,300
 It's now no longer using the phone.

250
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,900
 You'll be walking through the dentist's office,

251
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,400
 phone safely on the hook, and you'll hear,

252
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,800
 "I can't even think of chopper.

253
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
 I can't even think of dumb enough insults

254
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,600
 that we know chopper is using."

255
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,200
 You're walking by the bathroom and it's like,

256
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
 "Hey, you stink."

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,300
 And you'd look and obviously,

258
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,800
 first you smell yourself, you're like,

259
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,300
 "Oh, no, I don't."

260
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,100
 And then you notice the voice was coming from the toilet,

261
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,000
 which talk about calling the kettle black.

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,100
 "Do toilets stink?"

263
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,700
 Now that I think about it, my toilets never smelled.

264
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
 I don't think toilets themselves smell.

265
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,100
 Then they hear the voice coming from drain pipes.

266
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,800
 They even hear it coming from electrical outlets.

267
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,200
 So this is definitely growing in power, whatever it is.

268
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
 Dr. Kurt spends 30,000,

269
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
 the equivalent of around $30,000,

270
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,100
 to retrofit the whole office.

271
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,600
 He's trying to figure out what's going on.

272
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,500
 They can't figure it out.

273
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
 Now around this time, two things happened.

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,500
 The police set up a unit called SoCo Geist.

275
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,900
 And it's a group of criminal police officers,

276
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,300
 not police officers who are actually criminals.

277
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,500
 These aren't just beat cops.

278
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,900
 These are actual investigators,

279
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,300
 criminal investigative police officers.

280
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,300
 They've created a unit to figure out what this ghost is.

281
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,200
 Is it real?

282
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
 What does it want?

283
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
 Do I really stink?

284
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,300
 It wants to know all those things.

285
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,100
 It wants to know, "Are the insults true?

286
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,000
 Did I really poop my pants?"

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
 And at the same time this unit is set up,

288
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,700
 this story goes worldwide.

289
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,800
 It was a local news story for a while.

290
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,200
 At this point, we're in 1982.

291
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,700
 It started in the summer of 1981.

292
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,100
 We're now in January or February of 1982.

293
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
 It's a worldwide news story.

294
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,500
 Parapsychologists are debating it.

295
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,700
 They're coming from around the world to visit the place.

296
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,300
 Journalists from Japan, USA are coming there.

297
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,200
 It's all over the news.

298
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,700
 So this has been going on for about eight months at this point.

299
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,400
 This mysterious voice insulting people coming from nowhere.

300
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,700
 Now, I left out a key detail to this.

301
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,400
 I didn't lie about anything.

302
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,500
 Everything I said was true.

303
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,100
 I left out a key detail though.

304
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
 It's a key detail that everyone else in the world knew though back then.

305
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,000
 Back then, not everyone knows it now, but you.

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,500
 You're like, "What?

307
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,800
 Seven billion people know this and I don't?

308
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,300
 What's the secret?"

309
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,800
 Back then in every news article, it had this fact.

310
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 In every story, it had this fact.

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,700
 I only hid it from you for dramatic effect.

312
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,300
 Dr. Kurt did not work alone.

313
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,500
 Dr. Kurt worked with a 16-year-old girl named Claudia.

314
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 And this voice, Chopper, would insult everybody in the dentist office but her.

315
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,800
 Now, this was widely reported.

316
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 This was widely reported in every article.

317
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,700
 Dr. Kurt had a 16-year-old assistant.

318
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,100
 Perfect prank age, right?

319
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
 That's the age.

320
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,000
 If you're not pulling pranks by 16, there's no hope for you.

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
 There's just nothing left for you.

322
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,400
 16-year-old girl, which again also curls notorious tricksters.

323
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,300
 16-year-old girl, this voice insults everybody but her.

324
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,100
 It'll be like, "Did you poop your pants?

325
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,700
 Officer, that child who died?

326
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
 You haven't solved that murder."

327
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,100
 And then it'll be like, "Claudia, I love you.

328
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,900
 You're so pretty and that hair.

329
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,300
 Oh, it's so nice."

330
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,900
 Every police officer was fully aware of the fact that he had a 16-year-old female assistant.

331
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,800
 Every officer was fully aware of the fact that the ghost always complimented her and made fun of everyone else.

332
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,900
 Every news article was fully aware of that.

333
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,000
 And this wasn't reported in the news, but this is something the police officers were fully aware of on the scene.

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,900
 This went on for eight months, by the way.

335
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,600
 Every time Chopper would talk, every single time Chopper would talk when there was a witness there,

336
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,700
 police officer would be standing there and he's purposely pooping his pants.

337
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,800
 He's like, "Let's see if this makes Chopper appear."

338
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,500
 Every single time, Claudia would turn around and then Chopper would go,

339
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,800
 "I think you just pooped your pants, Officer Stinky."

340
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 And then she turned back around.

341
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,200
 She's like, "Oh my God, did you hear that?"

342
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
 And they'd be like, "Oh my God, there's a poltergeist."

343
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,300
 Every single time.

344
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
 She's like, "Hold on, I got something in my teeth.

345
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,600
 I gotta turn around."

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,400
 She turns around.

347
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
 She's like pretending to take something out of her teeth.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,500
 "You are gross, but Claudia, you're the most beautiful woman in the world."

349
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,800
 And you got that out of your teeth.

350
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,500
 And she turns around.

351
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,300
 She's like, "How did it know I had something in my teeth?"

352
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,700
 But the cops still don't break the case.

353
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,200
 The cops, every single time she turns around is when they hear the voice.

354
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,400
 And the cops still don't put two and two together, but they have a date.

355
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,800
 This is such a breaking, true crime story.

356
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,200
 It was March 3, 1982.

357
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,100
 There was a police officer.

358
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,400
 There were police officers.

359
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,500
 They were searching.

360
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,800
 They searched 55 adjacent apartments in the building where this dentist office was.

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,500
 They had people in the sewer checking lines, but it was on March 3, 1982.

362
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,700
 A police officer was standing in the dentist office and he saw Claudia turn around and he probably didn't think,

363
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,900
 "Oh, the chopper's about to talk."

364
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
 He didn't even think about that.

365
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:03,400
 But when he saw Claudia turn around, he could see her reflection in the mirror and saw her lips moving,

366
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,800
 perfectly matching what chopper was saying.

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
 It was all a fraud.

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,900
 Chopper, are you shocked?

369
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,000
 Are you shocked?

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,300
 Chopper never existed.

371
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,500
 They should have figured that out.

372
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 Once they walked into the room, the guy's like, "Yeah, it's weird.

373
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
 I'm getting these prank phone calls."

374
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,300
 And they walk into the dentist's office and there's a 16-year-old girl there.

375
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 They should have been like, "She did it."

376
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,000
 "She's most likely doing it or her friends or something like that."

377
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,300
 But no, this went on for eight months.

378
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,100
 Here is what happened.

379
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,700
 The dentist and Claudia found out through some fluke that because of the tiled floor

380
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,600
 in the way that the dentist's office was set up, it was like in this apartment complex

381
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,000
 that you could throw your voice really, really easily.

382
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,500
 You just had to like change it a bit and angle it and it would actually sound like it was coming from

383
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,000
 another part of the dentist's office.

384
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,800
 It was a parlor trick.

385
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,200
 So Dr. Kurt, we don't know.

386
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 They never admitted why they did it.

387
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 Some people think he was doing it to drum up business,

388
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,200
 but who wants to go to a haunted dentist's office?

389
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,900
 Like, sure, you might go there to hear the voice, but then he's like,

390
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,800
 "You want me to give you some fillings?"

391
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
 You're like, "No, I'm good."

392
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,100
 It's not really a spur-in-the-moment thing.

393
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,500
 Some people say that she did it.

394
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,700
 Claudia came up with the idea because she wasn't getting any attention, which is possible.

395
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,500
 But why did he go along with it?

396
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,100
 Both of them say, "Yes, we faked the voice in the dentist's office,

397
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,300
 but we didn't fake the telephone voice."

398
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,400
 They say what happened is first they were getting prank phone calls from somebody.

399
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,500
 The very, very beginning.

400
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,200
 Before he called the cops, he says he was getting prank phone calls.

401
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,600
 And this is when we bring in Dr. Kurt's wife.

402
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,700
 Apparently Dr. Kurt's wife was jealous of the 16-year-old girl.

403
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,300
 So she began calling up her husband and threatening him.

404
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:08,400
 Or Claudia had two suitors, two boyfriends, who were jealous of Dr. Kurt,

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,700
 and were calling him up to threaten him.

406
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,300
 They don't know, but they said we were getting prank phone calls in the beginning.

407
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,100
 And that's what gave us the idea to do the throwing the voice thing.

408
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,200
 I don't know how she was able to throw her voice and intercept the phone call when the cops were there.

409
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,600
 That was her.

410
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,100
 But apparently before all of this started, it started with some prank phone calls.

411
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,600
 So what happened with all of this?

412
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,900
 Obviously, they all look like a bunch of buffoons, right?

413
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,200
 And so did the police.

414
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,400
 And so did every journalist who spent any time covering the story.

415
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,900
 I can understand being curious about it, but again, the second you walked in there and saw a 16-year-old girl

416
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,300
 turn around every time you heard the voice, you should have figured it out.

417
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,100
 Claudia got fined 1,500 Deutschmarks.

418
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:59,000
 Dr. Kurt and his wife got fined 35,000 Deutschmarks, especially about like $15,000 in U.S. money.

419
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,700
 The stress was so much on Dr. Kurt and his wife.

420
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
 They actually checked themselves into a psychiatric hospital.

421
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,800
 And I'm assuming eventually they checked themselves out, but there's no news.

422
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,700
 Claudia, she has disappeared.

423
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,100
 But not in a spooky way, not in like a spooky, interesting way.

424
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,700
 She basically just changed her name and disappeared into Germany.

425
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,500
 So you could be sitting next to Claudia right now.

426
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,400
 You happen to be in Germany right now.

427
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,100
 And let's see, she was 16 in 1981.

428
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,500
 So that would be, she'd be like in her 56 or something like that now.

429
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,300
 You're sitting next to a 56-year-old German woman.

430
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,200
 That could be Chopper.

431
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,800
 It's like a million, actually it would be like what, 400 million in one or whatever the population of Germany is.

432
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,600
 I don't think it's 400 million, but it's a lot in one.

433
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,500
 It's a lot to one.

434
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
 But that's the story of Chopper.

435
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,700
 And I like that story.

436
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,900
 And I also, let me give a shout out to, I hadn't heard about this story until I came across

437
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
 a Reddit post from the user Mateel.

438
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,400
 So thank you.

439
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
 This was something that I'd never heard of.

440
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
 It was pretty obscure.

441
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,000
 I like this story because whenever we hear about ghosts, a lot of times like people think I'm too skeptical.

442
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,100
 I actually think I'm not skeptical enough, honestly.

443
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,400
 If you listen to early episodes, I was way more skeptical.

444
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,900
 But you just read the stuff all the time and you're like, "Yeah, maybe."

445
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,800
 And then I like, you kind of, I kind of opened my mind up more.

446
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,400
 I used to believe everything.

447
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,800
 And then I became super skeptical and now I'm kind of in between.

448
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,400
 But this is the type of stuff that makes people skeptical.

449
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,000
 And I think, honestly, more often than not, most ghost stories, this is the answer.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,500
 I honestly think most ghost stories are either misidentification or this.

451
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,800
 And that goes with UFO and Bigfoot.

452
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 And you would go, "Why would people make up these stories?

453
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,400
 Why would they open themselves up to ridicule if they want attention?"

454
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,600
 I mean, ridicule is at least some sort of attention, right?

455
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 Like, if I was calling people out and making fun of them, it's attention.

456
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,100
 To you and me, it might seem like negative attention,

457
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,600
 but negative attention to some people is better than no attention at all.

458
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,500
 So I really wonder, I don't want to put a number on it,

459
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,900
 but I really wonder how many paranormal stories are just fake.

460
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,500
 100% fake.

461
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,200
 And it sucks.

462
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,500
 But it sucks overall, but when we can find them like this, I think it's pretty funny.

463
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,600
 Like, I think like if...

464
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,800
 I've always thought about that, when you die and you're floating off to heaven,

465
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,900
 if Jaffy tucks on a cloud next to you,

466
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,200
 let's say you're a huge Bigfoot guy, you're a Bigfoot hunter.

467
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,800
 You spend your whole life, you're fascinated by Bigfoot from the age of 12,

468
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,200
 and then you're 73, you die.

469
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
 And as you're going into heaven, as you're going into the afterlife,

470
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,200
 all of the world's mysteries are being revealed to you.

471
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,500
 And you find out that Bigfoot's not real, that it was all fake.

472
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,600
 Every single sighting was either misidentification,

473
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,100
 somebody making it up, someone pulling a prank.

474
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,900
 That would suck.

475
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,300
 It would be super disappointing, right?

476
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,000
 If you just knew as a fact they were all fake.

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
 But if you can look at individual stories, I think it's interesting to hear a ghost story

478
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,400
 and then find out how they faked it or why it was faked.

479
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,800
 I find that stuff interesting.

480
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,100
 I believe in ghosts, I've seen stuff like that.

481
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,100
 I've seen a lot of supernatural stuff, but I still like hearing

482
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,700
 about the hoaxes, how they're pulled off and things like that.

483
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,200
 I don't want to hear that they're all fake,

484
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,900
 but we got to admit some of them are, and I think this story is interesting

485
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,500
 because it shows how easy it is to fool hundreds of people over the course of eight months.

486
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
 It wasn't a one night thing.

487
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,700
 Team ad, let's call in that carboner copter.

488
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,900
 We are leaving behind this dentist office.

489
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,300
 I got a grill.

490
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,100
 I got brand new diamond teeth put in.

491
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,300
 I got my grill put in.

492
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,200
 That's weird.

493
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 Some light just shined in my haunted closet.

494
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
 This is legitimately haunted closet, by the way.

495
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,300
 But anyway, we're going to forget the supernatural light that just descended upon me.

496
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,600
 Team ad, let's hop in that carboner copter.

497
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,100
 Grow some cookie arms.

498
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
 We are leaving behind Germany.

499
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,600
 I got my new grill.

500
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,100
 I'm going to take a big old bite out of your shoulder.

501
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,500
 Fly us out of here.

502
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,400
 We are headed to Beverly Hills.

 [imitates gunshots]

504
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,400
 I have this ad read here for Murderberry when I'm going to just not do it this time

505
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,600
 because I'm going to tell you right now, Murderberry when is a really just my own words

506
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,700
 is a really, really dope movie.

507
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,800
 It's about three friends.

508
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 They're these game designers and they've come up with this perfect game.

509
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,700
 It's like a game like Clue, but you're the murderer.

510
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,800
 And these guys, they've built this game from scratch and they're trying to get it crowdfunded.

511
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:53,100
 But a set of mysterious events happens and they are brought to the doorstep of a stranger

512
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,800
 who offers to make all their dreams come true.

513
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,500
 But what happens is they stumble across through another set of events, a dead body,

514
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,400
 and they have to make a choice.

515
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,900
 Deal with the life altering circumstances of that dead body or try to cover it up.

516
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,200
 And they use the rules of their own game to do so.

517
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,900
 Would you have the stomach to dispose of a corpse based on rules you googled to put into a card game?

518
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,100
 Find out on Murderberry when and you can preorder it now at murderberrywin.com.

519
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,400
 It's a really, really good movie.

520
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,900
 Feature length debut film by Michael Loven, I believe, I think was the name.

521
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,400
 Fellow Patreon dead rabbit supporter and close personal friend of mine Carson also worked on the movie.

522
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
 Really, really good film.

523
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
 Murderberrywin. Check it out.

524
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,700
 And if you don't preorder it, if you don't preorder it, if you preorder it,

525
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,900
 you get a free deck of the cards that they use in the game.

526
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,900
 But if you don't preorder it, you'll definitely want to rent it.

527
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,600
 You'll definitely want to rent it when it comes out because it is very, very good movie.

528
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,500
 It's getting great reviews.

529
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
 So that is my read.

530
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,700
 That's 100% authentic my read of it.

531
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,000
 And it was really, really good.

532
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,800
 Team ad, you're flying this carbon helicopter over Beverly Hills.

533
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,800
 We are back in the year 2012.

534
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,700
 Specifically, it's November 2012.

535
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,300
 Now, before we get started on this story, I actually covered a bit of this on episode 381.

536
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,400
 The return of Hans Wormhat was that episode.

537
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,700
 That episode's interesting because it came out on February 4th, 2020.

538
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,100
 I was actually listening to it again.

539
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,800
 I was going to include it as a bonus episode in "Might in the Future."

540
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:43,700
 But it came out on February 4th, 2020, about a month before the lockdowns began.

541
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,800
 And the first story is about the coronavirus.

542
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,100
 And it's specifically about fake news surrounding all the video footage coming out of China,

543
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,300
 showing all of this horrible stuff in China, body shaking on gurneys,

544
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,400
 people being locked into their houses and stuff like that.

545
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,900
 And it's an interesting episode.

546
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's an interesting time capsule of an episode because I keep going.

547
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,100
 I don't know.

548
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,200
 I don't think millions of people are going to die.

549
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 And at that time, we are predicting like, you know, tens of millions of people die.

550
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,300
 And I know a lot of people have died, but it cut.

551
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,900
 And it's an interesting time capsule because I'm working on the information that I have then.

552
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,000
 And we definitely have more.

553
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,100
 We had more information just a month later, but it's an interesting time capsule of an episode.

554
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,700
 But the second story, the return of Hans Wormhat, specifically talks about his theory.

555
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,800
 Hans Wormhat is a guy that we've covered quite a few times on the show.

556
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,300
 He believes that men put it in a nutshell.

557
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,900
 Is that a word?

558
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,700
 Is that a term?

559
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,500
 He put it in a nutshell?

560
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 No pun intended either.

561
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,000
 That all men are women and all women are men, except for a small minority.

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,700
 I am a woman because I am chubby.

563
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,800
 And he is a man.

564
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,700
 He's actually a man who is a man because he's thin.

565
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,200
 So if you're a chubby man, you actually your your gender was changed at birth.

566
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,900
 So I'm really a woman.

567
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:03,100
 And this is actually this is actually conspiracy theory that is really blown up just in the past year.

568
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
 It's called transvestigation.

569
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's an observational conspiracy theory.

570
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,300
 You show pictures of celebrities and go, that looks like a woman.

571
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,800
 It's like the rock.

572
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,200
 But because the rock has big pecs, aka boobs, the rock is a woman.

573
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,300
 Vin Diesel is a woman and he put on some weight.

574
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,800
 So there is this whole thing about Vin Diesel was a pregnant woman.

575
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,500
 It's actually a very growing conspiracy theory.

576
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,000
 And the reason why I was talking about it because it's hilarious, right?

577
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800
 Because it's hilarious.

578
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,300
 Do I need any other reason?

579
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:39,200
 But Harvey Weinstein was in the news back in 2020 because during his trial, they showed photographs of his genitalia.

580
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,700
 And one of his victims, she said she when she saw Harvey Weinstein, she actually felt sorry for him

581
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,900
 because it was just a total mess down there.

582
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,800
 It was straight up clam chowder.

583
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
 Like stuff was missing.

584
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,900
 There were skin grafts.

585
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,100
 She said it looked like he had extensive scarring in his genital region.

586
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,900
 She said it looked like he just really wasn't even male.

587
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:09,400
 So I covered that because I go, I'm surprised Hans Wormhat isn't all over this because here's a huge Hollywood player.

588
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,700
 Even though he's completely disgraced, even though he's a monster, he still was an A-list Hollywood player.

589
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,000
 As a producer, being identified as not a man in court documents.

590
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,100
 I go, how's Hans Wormhat not all over this?

591
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,900
 But then I kind of filed in the back of my head.

592
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:32,900
 I don't keep Harvey Weinstein's genitals on my mind until today, until the other day actually was the other day.

593
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,600
 I came across an article.

594
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
 It's November 2012.

595
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,500
 We are at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

596
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,600
 There's a young woman there.

597
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,000
 Her name is Haley Grip.

598
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
 She's 19 years old.

599
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,500
 She's just there.

600
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,400
 She's having a quick snack, having a granola bar, reading a book.

601
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,600
 She's going to a casting call soon.

602
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,200
 The casting calls like down the street, but you know, this is a good place to just kind of chill and relax.

603
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,400
 This woman walks up to her.

604
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,000
 Let's call her Betty.

605
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,300
 I don't know her actual name, but Betty walks up to Haley and says,

606
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,200
 Hey, mind if I sit here and eat a granola bar with you?

607
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,400
 I don't know how she broke that.

608
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200
 It doesn't say how she broke the ice.

609
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,000
 Nice t-shirt.

610
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,300
 Mind if I sit down?

611
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,800
 Betty comes down and starts chatting with Haley and starts to add, you know, what are you doing in town?

612
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,500
 How's the book?

613
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,900
 Stuff like that.

614
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,900
 And Haley is nice to have a friend, right?

615
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,300
 Haley starts talking to her and says, Yeah, you know, I'm trying to make it.

616
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,800
 I'm actually a hair model.

617
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,000
 I do a lot of modeling as part of my thing.

618
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,600
 You see photographs of people with hair, grudge movies.

619
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,500
 That was all me.

620
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,100
 I was all that creepy hair.

621
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,800
 She goes out, I have the casting call down the street.

622
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,900
 I'm just here kind of hanging out and she starts to kind of open up to have this long conversation.

623
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,500
 And Haley tells Betty, Yeah, I also, you know, one of the struggles I have is I have Tourette syndrome.

624
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,300
 I have Tourette syndrome.

625
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,200
 Now that's not always like in the movies.

626
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
 She wasn't screaming out cuss words.

627
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,500
 She wasn't like chopper from the first story.

628
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,000
 Tourette isn't always vocal.

629
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
 Sometimes it's physical twitches.

630
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,300
 Sometimes it's facial twitches.

631
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,200
 It could be a whole specter of things.

632
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,300
 But she does that would make it hard to be an actor.

633
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,100
 If you had facial tics and things like that, not impossible, but it would just be harder.

634
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
 She tells Betty all this stuff and Betty goes, you know what?

635
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
 You got this big casting call going on.

636
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 I actually know like in this banquet hall, there's a bunch of like industry vets there.

637
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,000
 They're having this huge breakfast.

638
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,300
 They're having this huge morning meal.

639
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,100
 What? Let's go in there.

640
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 Let's crash it.

641
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,100
 Let's do some girl stuff and go eat some pancakes.

642
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,000
 If that's what girls do, I don't know.

643
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
 I'm assuming women eat pancakes.

644
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,300
 So Haley goes, yeah, sure.

645
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,900
 You know, this granola bar is not really cutting it and who's going to pass up pancakes?

646
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,300
 So they go there and they're eating breakfast and they're doing all this stuff.

647
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 They're having a pillow fight.

648
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,400
 It's like a straight up sleepover.

649
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,300
 They're watching Halloween three.

650
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,200
 And then after all of that, Betty goes, listen, I didn't have that casting call, but I'm going to tell you something right now.

651
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,100
 I know a guy.

652
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,800
 He's actually staying in this hotel right now.

653
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 I could probably arrange a meeting with him.

654
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,900
 He can make your career.

655
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,300
 This casting call thing is nothing.

656
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,500
 This guy, this is the guy you want to talk to.

657
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,200
 So she goes up.

658
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,700
 Her interest is definitely peaked at this point.

659
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,300
 And Betty and Haley go upstairs, go to this hotel room.

660
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,900
 And in the hotel room, she sees Harvey Weinstein.

661
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,000
 She doesn't recognize Harvey Weinstein.

662
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,100
 Back in 20, even today, I don't know how many people would recognize him.

663
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,000
 I think more people would.

664
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,100
 But back in 2012, back before all the allegations, I think only film buffs.

665
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
 I could recognize Harvey Weinstein on the spot.

666
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,500
 I could not recognize Bill Gates.

667
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
 We've talked about that before.

668
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,100
 Bill Gates could appear in my honor closet right now.

669
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
 I'd be like, ah, it's a nerd.

670
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,500
 But like, I would totally recognize Harvey Weinstein because I'm more of a film guy than a computer guy.

671
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,400
 But she didn't.

672
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,800
 And he didn't introduce himself as Harvey Weinstein.

673
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
 He introduced himself as Dom.

674
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
 He's all my names Dom Toretto.

675
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
 I'm a pregnant woman.

676
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,500
 He introduced himself as Dom.

677
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,200
 And he offers her a glass of wine.

678
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,500
 Now she says, I'm only 19.

679
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,400
 I'm actually not old enough to drink.

680
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,900
 And at that point, Betty, her friend that she's met, you know, I don't know how much time has passed.

681
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,800
 Let's say an hour.

682
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,900
 They had all these conversations.

683
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,800
 They ate a full breakfast.

684
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
 Got extras.

685
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,100
 Got seconds on pancakes.

686
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:24,700
 Betty says it's rude to refuse a drink when someone's offered you hospitality and fed you.

687
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,600
 Like she's done all these things for her.

688
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,500
 You're going to turn down a drink.

689
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
 It's the morning.

690
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,200
 You know, it's not it's not like it's late at night.

691
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,100
 Like what's the worst that can happen?

692
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,100
 So Haley starts drinking this glass of wine.

693
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,600
 She says through the course of this conversation, she's drinking the wine.

694
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,200
 They're talking about the industry.

695
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,900
 She's starting to get drowsy.

696
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:58,100
 And then she in her terms briefly blanks out.

697
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,200
 And when she starts to kind of realize what's going on,

698
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,100
 she is pinned down to a coffee table and Harvey Weinstein is on top of her.

699
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,100
 He I don't even want he's I don't I mean,

700
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,800
 I know it's a true crime podcast, but there's stuff that I don't even like to talk about.

701
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,200
 But without going into incredible detail, he's raping her.

702
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,800
 He tells her this is so bizarre.

703
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:30,700
 He tells her basically just go with the flow and quote pretend I'm someone like Zac Efron.

704
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:38,300
 She's struggling to get herself out of this predicament physically and her arms are flailing around

705
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,800
 and she has these long acrylic nails.

706
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,700
 And as she's flailing around and as Harvey is trying to hold her down,

707
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:54,200
 her hand hits the coffee table and one of the nails breaks doesn't break completely off

708
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:05,900
 but becomes jagged and in a move that I think I would only appreciate like Batman or snake eyes being able to pull off.

709
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,200
 Harvey Weinstein's genitals are exposed.

710
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,700
 She is able throughout all of this chaos that's going on.

711
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:20,400
 She's perfectly able to aim that finger and it tears into his testicles.

712
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,500
 There's a quote here. I'm going to read this quote from this article written by John Levine for page six.

713
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,000
 He got this stuff from the actual court documents because this is a case that's coming up.

714
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:46,200
 Weinstein let out a quiet scream and grabbed her hand inadvertently causing her nail to move up and inward deeper into his scrotum.

715
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,400
 So now it's like her fingertip. Her fingertip is inside there.

716
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,900
 The nail has already penetrated the nut sack.

717
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:01,800
 Her fingertip is on this dude's balls on the inside.

718
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,300
 Blood is pouring out.

719
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,500
 He pushes her away and she uses this opportunity to get out of there.

720
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 He grabs a towel and try to soak up the blood.

721
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,000
 The second she gets out of the hotel room, Betty is standing outside of the door almost like she was guarding it.

722
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,300
 Betty tells her that what happened in there is your fault.

723
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,600
 It's your Tourette syndrome. You're crazy.

724
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,100
 And if you tell anyone what happened, you're going to end up in a psychiatric hospital.

725
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,000
 Haley just runs out of the hotel.

726
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,500
 She actually did not report this crime.

727
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,900
 She wasn't part of the multi-million dollar settlement that 100 other women were part of.

728
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,300
 She wasn't part of that huge trial.

729
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,200
 This is going to be something separate.

730
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,500
 And when she tells this story, people go, "Now we know why his genitals are mutilated."

731
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,700
 But you go, "Jason, just a fingernail in your testicle."

732
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,800
 Unless she's Wolverine, right?

733
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,100
 She didn't just rip it to pieces.

734
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,300
 Well, there is a thing.

735
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,900
 Do not Google this, by the way.

736
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,100
 I was reading this story late at night and Ben Googled it.

737
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,600
 Not the images you want to see before you go to bed.

738
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,400
 There is a disease known as "Fornier's Gangrene."

739
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
 Now, we all know what gangrene is.

740
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,600
 It's basically, it's a flesh-eating virus.

741
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,700
 It's like when circulation gets cut off to a body part.

742
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,600
 It gets gross and smelly and, you know, your feet will fall off.

743
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
 It'll turn black and things like that.

744
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,700
 "Fornier's Gangrene" is specifically that, but only for your testicles.

745
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,600
 It's only for your penis, your testicles, the perineum, all that stuff.

746
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 It's when you get a cut.

747
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,400
 You guys are going to be super scared from now on.

748
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,500
 You get a cut or a nick anywhere around there.

749
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,700
 It can get fungus in it.

750
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,600
 It can get a virus, a bacteria.

751
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,000
 Just some little bacteria is hanging out in your underwear,

752
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,300
 waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

753
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,900
 And, and incredibly quickly, it becomes the flesh-eating virus.

754
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,700
 It begins to rott away the skin down there.

755
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,100
 Now, best-case scenario, you catch it early on.

756
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,800
 They give you an IV, give you a bunch of antibiotics, you're fine.

757
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 Worst-case scenario, you are Harvey Weinstein.

758
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,300
 They had to amputate his testicles.

759
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,100
 He required skin grafts all along his penis.

760
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,500
 And, before he had sex, he had one of his personal assistants have to inject this medication into him,

761
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,000
 into his dick, to get it hard.

762
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,200
 Which begs the question.

763
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,700
 We know he is a rapist.

764
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,500
 He's been found guilty of that.

765
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,700
 He required an injection before the rapes.

766
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,000
 Shouldn't his personal assistants be accountable for all this stuff?

767
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Shouldn't they be co-conspirators?

768
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Some of them have gone on to very lucrative careers.

769
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,100
 Now, I'm not saying everyone who ever worked for Harvey Weinstein

770
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,200
 has injected his penis right before he raped somebody, but some of them did.

771
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,600
 And if I sell a gun to someone who shouldn't deserve a gun, like a felon,

772
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,800
 and they go out and murder someone with it, or a kid and they murder someone with it,

773
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
 then I can be held criminally accountable.

774
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,600
 So why aren't these personal assistants who are injecting him with rape juice

775
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
 being held personally accountable?

776
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,700
 But she basically destroyed his genitals with just a gash.

777
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,100
 Now, this story here still has a work its way through court.

778
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,500
 This story here is still allegations.

779
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,500
 It wouldn't make sense though, because the woman who was testifying against him in court

780
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,700
 and said it looked like everything was messed up down there, that was in 2013.

781
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,400
 That was a year after this event.

782
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,500
 And it did come out later on in the trial.

783
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
 People were wondering, "Dude, why is everything all messed up down there?"

784
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,400
 It did turn out he did have four years gangrene, but they never knew how he got it.

785
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,900
 You can get it by having certain factors, being obese, getting cut down there,

786
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,600
 having pet badgers attack you between the legs, not being clean.

787
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,900
 There are risk factors for that.

788
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:21,100
 But a big risk factor is trying to rape people and then getting punched in the balls with a broken fingernail.

789
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,300
 And then grabbing that hand and pushing it deeper in.

790
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,600
 So it's an allegation.

791
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,800
 It'll work its way through the court system, but it is an allegation that makes sense.

792
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,400
 We know he's a rapist and we know that everything's chopped up down there.

793
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
 The reason why I wanted to cover this story is obvious.

794
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,300
 One, it's completely disgusting, but two, it's a story of justice.

795
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,600
 It's a story of justice.

796
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,900
 Aren't we always talking about, "Man, if all those rapists and all those pedophiles and all those people

797
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,400
 put me in a cell with them for 10 minutes, I'll show them what's what.

798
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
 I'll take care of them."

799
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,600
 But you know what, we know that that's not the real world.

800
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 We actually can't do that.

801
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:09,700
 So the second best thing is them losing their source of power, them losing their Castle Grayskull.

802
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,300
 This man, he prayed on women for years, for decades.

803
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,600
 They were just paying them off.

804
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,000
 They had a special set in the organization, the Weinstein organization, that was taking care of all of these

805
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,900
 non-disclosure agreements, just funneling money out to these women.

806
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,300
 He was abusing.

807
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,200
 And then this woman, that this Betty character, we don't actually know her name.

808
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,000
 She's unidentified.

809
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,800
 It was a random person working for the Weinstein organization.

810
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,600
 Picks this woman out of the crowd because she's alone, because she's young.

811
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,100
 Young people don't know any better.

812
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
 Oh, she has Tourette's.

813
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,500
 No, Jerry will believe her.

814
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,000
 Those people are cuckoo.

815
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,200
 And they pluck this woman.

816
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,500
 They feed her.

817
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,200
 They become her friend.

818
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,100
 Hey, we can make all your dreams come true.

819
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,300
 You just got to come up and have a meeting with this guy.

820
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,800
 And she punched him in the balls.

821
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
 So hard, they fell off.

822
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,500
 That's justice.

823
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
 That's just pure justice.

824
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:11,900
 Unfortunately, he was still protected and he was still able to engage in this disgusting activity for another,

825
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,200
 what, seven years after this?

826
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:22,300
 But every time he looked down, every time that he looked at his mangled genitals,

827
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,200
 every time that needle had to pierce his penis just so he could get an erection,

828
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,100
 he knew the reason for that.

829
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,900
 He picked on the wrong girl.

830
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,400
