1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 Is Winnie the Pooh a sex addict? How do you say that? Is Winnie the Pooh addicted to sex?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,560
 And then we take a look at the bizarre cult of Sherry Schreiner. A woman who believes that alien

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,120
 reptilian demons are slowly taken over the planet and only she has the ability to teach you how to

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,080
 fight them. But when her war against demonic extraterrestrials turns into a real life murder,

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,760
 who's to blame today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:55,200
 Pump throwing punches. Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,040
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,640
 Actually I'm having a great day. I always had a hard time taking naps on Sunday. I always felt

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
 it was a waste of time. It's my first but I've kind of come to peace with it. I take a two hour

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,680
 nap on Sunday and I'm just like it's just part of the routine now. I don't like doing it because I

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,960
 feel like I could be doing more stuff but you got a nap right? Me and babies we both have to nap.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,360
 You know I wanted to touch on something real quick here. It's one of those things that I've been

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,800
 following just because I have YouTube but I think it's probably one of the dumbest things going on

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,880
 right now. However I do believe there's a conspiracy involved in it. If you have been on YouTube recently

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
 or you follow this stuff anyways because you're a big gamer, apparently this trailer came out for

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,400
 this Sonic the Hedgehog thing. Now people have been quote unquote up in arms and Twitter has

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,960
 quote unquote been a fire with responses. All this stuff is really it's a minority of people but anyways

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,320
 they've been complaining about how Sonic looks in the new trailer. Now first off Sonic is a loser

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,400
 character. Sonic is the Poochie of video game characters. Mario was based they said what can

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,600
 we make out of a few pixels that you can identify stuff and they based it the guys who created Mario

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,160
 based it on their fat landlord who was always harassing them and we have Mario. He very very

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,840
 organically created character. Sonic was literally Poochie. It was a bunch of executives sitting

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,480
 around saying what are the cool kids like these days? What can we make this really snazzy and

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,440
 vibrant? And they crafted this character and blah blah blah. I've never been a fan of Sonic. I've

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,360
 never been a fan of his games. It's literally press right the game. Hit jump occasionally. But it moves

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:51,200
 very fast. People like it. Anyways that old man ran to side. The Sonic the Hedgehog they're doing a

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
 live action movie and the design looks pretty stupid. It doesn't really look like Sonic the

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,800
 Hedgehog. Again I could care less but it came out that the director was like listen we heard you guys

29
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
 and you guys don't like the design. We're gonna fix it. Movie comes out in November but we're

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,160
 gonna fix the design of Sonic because you guys don't like it so much and all of the critics were

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,720
 like we won. All of the Twitter critics and all of the YouTube critics were like whoa they're

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
 actually here. This is what I think actually happened because really there's no way they

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,280
 can redesign it by November in the way people think they can. Especially because people want

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
 Sonic to be a little shorter, a little more squat, not have such long legs, and they would have to

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
 reshoot every scene where an actor was looking at a CGI guy because the eye level is going to have

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,400
 to drop a couple inches for it to look like video game Sonic. This is what I think happened. I think

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,440
 they have a passable version of Sonic but it wasn't 100% and the studio said listen we're gonna

38
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,040
 create this trailer and we're gonna put in a really really stupid looking CGI Sonic in this trailer

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 and people are gonna hate it and we're gonna get a bunch of bad press but then we're gonna say no

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,560
 we're gonna work on it. We will then reveal our original design for the Sonic movie which doesn't

41
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,360
 look like the version from the game but people will there then go oh that's an improvement over

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,320
 the trailer at least. It doesn't look as good as we wanted but it's improvement than what they were

43
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,920
 going to sell us. The model they have for the Sonic does not look anything like Sonic other

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,360
 than the fact that he's blue and has like little spikes and not even the color of the stomach was

45
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
 the same. Unfortunately I don't know that much about Sonic as lame as I think he is. I know what

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,840
 Sonic looks like so I think that they did shoot a whole movie and put in a Sonic that they felt

47
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,080
 wasn't up to expectations. They cut a trailer with an even worse looking Sonic. Everyone complains

48
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,920
 in that way when they release the movie with the okay looking Sonic. The fans will be like well

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 at least they listen to us. At least they listen to us fans. I think that's the most

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,800
 likeless scenario. I don't think this is a movie that they would do extensive reshoots to change

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,200
 eye lines and everything like that in shadows. There's a lot that goes involved into fixing a CGI

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,320
 character from making him four feet tall to making him like three feet tall or whatever he ends up

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,760
 being. So that's that's my conspiracy theory on that and I think it's stupid. I think the whole

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,920
 thing is dumb but if you like Sonic then whatever. But that being said let's move on to our first

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:32,560
 story. Now yeah that wasn't even a story that was just a little bit of a Genesis rant. Genesis system

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,760
 was okay. I just didn't like I thought Sonic. I think Sonic's lame. Anyways so let's go ahead and

57
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,040
 get started here with our first story. Now our first story is an interesting exercise in both

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:51,360
 how people can be gross and how journalists structure their stories. So I read this article

59
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,120
 recently and it's about Jim Cummings. If you don't know who Jim Cummings is you've heard him.

60
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,880
 You've heard definitely heard a version of his voice. He's the voice of Winnie the Pooh.

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,560
 He's the voice of Tigger. He's the voice of a couple gummy bears. He's the voice of Louis

62
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,520
 from Tailspin. He's the voice of Darkwing Duck and he's been in tons of video done voices for

63
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
 tons of video games. He did a voice for a game called Alpha Protocol which if you've never played

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,960
 that that game is awesome. It's like a 24 type game. You're like a secret spy with alternate.

65
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,360
 It's great. Check it out. But anyways he's done all these voices. He's been a part of almost

66
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
 everyone's childhood. He did the voice for Winnie the Pooh in the recent Christopher Robin movies.

67
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,120
 So he's still doing stuff. Nowadays most young people have probably heard him more from games

68
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
 that he's done voices in but for people my age and a little bit younger they've heard him through

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,720
 all these cartoons. I think he's done like 250 character voices throughout his- so anyways Jim

70
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,440
 Cummings is in a custody battle with his ex-wife Stephanie. They were married from 2001 to 2011.

71
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,840
 They got a divorce and now she wants solo custody of the kids or the term is full custody of the kids.

72
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,040
 Now I read this article and I'm literally just sitting there and I'm kind of reading this article

73
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,200
 and the way the article was structured there was a completely different way the journalist could

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,600
 have gone about this. I almost feel like the article was structured for most people to go "Hmm,

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,720
 well maybe" and then when you flip it like we'll do it the end you'll be like "There is a totally

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
 different way to structure this article." The title of the article is "Winnie the Pooh, Disney

77
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,000
 Voice Star Jim Cummings, Accused of Rape, Animal Abuse" and you're like "That is something I need

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,960
 to click on." That sounds like- that is a headline I did not expect to read. When you see him

79
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
 a headline like that you're like "I'm taking five minutes out of my day to read this. This is

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,480
 bizarre." So Stephanie is saying that these things have happened and again we're going to go in the

81
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,080
 order that they're listed in the article. "He engaged in physical, sexual, and emotional abuse

82
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,280
 including but not limited to death threats, rape, and various sexual deviant behavior forced upon

83
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,400
 me without my consent." And I'm like "Ooh, that is quite the litany of charges. That is- that's

84
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,960
 pretty harsh stuff. Divorce proceeding, custody proceeding, so hyperbole or true?" As we go

85
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,560
 through the article you will go "Oh, because Jim starts to give his side of the story and it does

86
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,320
 not put him in a good light." So first off she's saying this stuff that one day she was in the

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,400
 kitchen and he walked in front of their four-year-old daughter. He walked in, slapped her on the butt

88
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,280
 and forced himself on her in front of their four-year-old daughter and I'm like "Oh my god,

89
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,560
 that's horrible." I go to the next sentence and it says "He forced himself on her by kissing her."

90
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,400
 Now that's still technically, yes, that's assault, that's a crime. You just can't walk up to people,

91
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,760
 you can't walk up to your ex-wife or your wife really if she doesn't want it, but you can't

92
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,200
 walk up to another human, spin them around and start making out with them. It's stuff you've seen

93
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,680
 in the movies, it's illegal in real life. And the terminology where he forced himself on her in

94
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,760
 front of the four-year-old daughter, I'm imagining Tigger raping his ex-wife. But then you go down

95
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,960
 the next sentence and they're making out, which again it's still assault, but I was immediately

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,240
 like "Whoa, okay, so now this article's really kind of put me in this weird sense where I'm thinking

97
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
 I'm gonna keep, that's gonna keep happening." And it does in a sense, so now I'm still like

98
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,240
 trying to figure out what is going on with this case. Then after that thing, which could be

99
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
 misconstrued, he walks up, he grabs her, spins around, kisses her, he's super passionate,

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,200
 four-year-old daughter sees daddy kissing a mommy, doesn't think anything of it.

101
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
 The next sentence after, and then I'm like "Well, you know, that's pretty rude and he shouldn't

102
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,880
 have done that." But next sentence after that, she says after the kiss, Jim asked if she could

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,480
 see him leaking because that's what I make him do when he touches me. And now we're playing ball,

104
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,040
 ladies and gentlemen, like that type of comment, I'm like "This guy's gross." First off,

105
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,000
 who uses the terminology "You make me leak, lady?" "You make me leak." Like there's a lot,

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,440
 one of the great things about sex is there's so many euphemisms for it. There's so many fun words

107
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,920
 for Jenna Taylor, there's so many fun words for having sex, there's sexy words, there's funny

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,920
 words. Leaking is not one of them, but I've never referred to myself as leaking, that's gross.

109
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
 That's a prostate problem, bro. That has nothing to do with your ex-wife. So at this point I'm

110
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,880
 thinking, okay, this guy is a creep, and he's talking about leaking, and I'm like "This guy is

111
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,120
 gross," and the whole time I'm imagining him sounding like Tigger. Tigger is easily my least

112
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,000
 favorite Winnie the Pooh character, and I love him all except Tigger. And she also says he

113
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
 raped me. I went to rehab because I just couldn't deal with it. Now this all happened after the

114
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,320
 divorce and before 2018 when this custody battle took place. She goes "He raped me. I had to go

115
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,000
 to rehab because I started doing drugs." She goes to rehab. He shows up at the rehab clinic,

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,920
 the rehab staff kicks him out. So this guy, at this point in the article I'm thinking,

117
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,800
 this guy is a certifiable nut job. She begins dating someone else who is an off-duty officer,

118
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
 that's not his profession. He's not constantly off-duty. She's dating a cop, and when he's off

119
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:26,640
 duty, Jim Cummings, who pops up into her house, bouncing on his Tigger tail, begins harassing her

120
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,840
 in front of an armed cop. He has to pull the gun on this gummy bear tailspin character,

121
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,360
 beloved character, pulls a gun on him, makes him bounce off back into the Hundred Acre Woods.

122
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,680
 This guy is a lunatic and he starts to defend himself because this is like a court battle,

123
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,760
 but his defenses are just absolutely hilarious. We'll get to these in a second.

124
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,920
 Probably the most egregious out of all of those things. The rape obviously was the worst, but

125
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
 we don't have any details on that. She ends up moving to Utah with her kids because she's like

126
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,880
 this dude's completely toxic and he's nuts. She moves to Utah. He follows her there,

127
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,160
 wants to see the kids, finds whatever, you can see the kids. She wakes up, he's masturbating,

128
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,200
 so she's dead asleep with her daughter in the bed. She wakes up, Winnie the Pooh,

129
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,760
 voice, beloved voice actor, dark wing duck is standing there in the shadows, masturbating,

130
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 with her hand and says she tries to stop and he goes, "If you stop, I'm gonna wake up our daughter.

131
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,360
 Let's get dangerous." He didn't actually say "Let's get dangerous," but I imagine

132
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,920
 he was thinking it. So she does it because she's terrified of what's going to happen.

133
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,720
 This total, now I should say, I've gone this far and this is all alleged, but at this point,

134
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,840
 I'm thinking this guy definitely has the pattern of being a creeper. And a rapist, allegedly,

135
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,600
 this is her word, but I'm on team Stephanie at this point. Let's get to some of his defenses.

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,840
 Now she didn't only bring up the sex stuff. He always said, "I was just being playful.

137
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,960
 I was just being playful. Everyone was laughing. I was laughing, spanked mommy on the butt,

138
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,640
 turned around, kissed her. It was this fun thing. I didn't mean for it to be this totally like

139
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,440
 rapey thing and you're thinking, "Maybe. Maybe." They don't give a lot of detail on the rape

140
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,280
 and I don't want to go into detail on it even if they did give it, but there's nothing there.

141
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,760
 But there are a couple other incidents where she said he has a drug problem. She said he's

142
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:37,360
 addicted to alcohol, marijuana, and Adderall. Now, no duh on the Adderall. If you had a personify

143
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,640
 Adderall as a animal, it would be Tigger. It would not shock me at all that the voice actor of Tigger

144
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,480
 was basically doing legal speed. But he goes, "What? No way. I've never done Adderall."

145
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,880
 But he did admit to drinking and smoking weed, which I guess now it's legal in California,

146
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,520
 but still the idea of Winnie the Pooh getting sloshed in the back 50 of the Hundred Acre Woods

147
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,840
 is just a bizarre thing. Of course, you know, he's going to be human, but speaking of humans,

148
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,880
 let's get to the last allegation here, because this is where we get his biggest defense of his

149
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
 behavior. She says, "Listen, we got a new puppy and it peed in the house. He took the puppy,

150
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,200
 put it in a metal bucket, like took it outside, covered it up with a metal bucket, like on that

151
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,280
 episode of Star Trek where what was it, Picard got locked in the box or maybe it was Jordy. I

152
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,720
 don't remember, but anyways, Jim takes the puppy out to the yard, covers it with a metal bucket to

153
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,480
 teach it a lesson not to pee in the house, and almost cooks it because it's super, super hot

154
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,880
 that day. It's like 90 degrees out that day. There's a little puppy underneath the metal bucket.

155
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,440
 Just cook it in there. Eventually Jim does remove the bucket. Dog's okay. Little puppy's okay.

156
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
 But he was near death. So actually, I think that's the opposite of okay. I mean okay in the sense that

157
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
 the dog didn't die, but Stephanie was like, "We had to take it to the vet because it was almost dead."

158
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,160
 That's how badly it was cooked in this thing. And Jim goes, "How dare you? How dare you? That is

159
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,040
 totally not what happened, guys. That's totally not what happened." He goes, "Listen, there wasn't..."

160
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:19,520
 This is his exact quote. "There was an incident where I put a tub, not a metal bucket, over a dog

161
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:27,440
 to isolate it briefly as a form of discipline to its behavior at our vet's suggestion. And unfortunately,

162
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,280
 I forgot the dog was there for a while. But then of course I released it. So he did do it. His only

163
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,360
 beef for that story is how big the container was. He's like, "Oh yeah, I totally trapped a dog outside

164
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,840
 and forgot about it and left it in the horrible horrible heat and it almost died." But a metal

165
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 bucket? No way. It was a tub. Next question. Your honor? Super bizarre. So as this article though

166
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,000
 is taking me on this roller coaster of all these just weird events, we get to the bottom where,

167
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,400
 where he claims she said, "I will go and I will ruin your reputation. I'm going to tell people

168
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,240
 Winnie the Pooh is a woman beating drug addicted freak. Winnie the Pooh lives with a whore. Winnie

169
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,520
 the Pooh, this is apparently her actual quote. Winnie the Pooh lives with a whore,

170
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,720
 pays a whore to pretend to be his girlfriend, rapes and abuses the mother of his kids, and

171
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,240
 she seems to be, I'm pretty sure Stephanie is mixed race. And so their daughters are mixed

172
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,400
 race. Jim Cummings is white. She I think is biracial. So their children are like a quarter of whatever

173
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,640
 different races, however it all works out. Apparently, according to her, Jim Cummings

174
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,200
 refers to his own children as inward babies. Rhymes with Tigger, if you needed a little bit of hint

175
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,280
 on that. It's so bizarre. I mean, it's one of those things that obviously lets if 50% of this stuff

176
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,880
 is true then this guy's totally nuts. But what's weird is that she's gotten multiple restraining

177
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:17,280
 orders. They have these incidences on record when they happen. When he came in and turned

178
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,680
 around and kissed her, that was the cause of the first restraining order. She went to the cops and

179
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,880
 was like, "Hey, dude, this guy's coming to my house. We used to be married, but he can't do them."

180
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,840
 The cops were like, "Yeah, you're right. He can't do that. Why don't you get a restraining order?"

181
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:35,680
 So there you go. That's an ongoing custody battle between beloved children's star Jim Cummings

182
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,440
 and his younger wife. He's 66. I think she's in her 30s or something like that. It's such a bizarre

183
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,040
 story. It's such a bizarre story. And it's funny because I really think if the article was flipped

184
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,280
 upside down, people would view it differently. If the article started off instead of these

185
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
 "she said moments" where she's saying, "Oh, he turned me around and kissed me," and he goes,

186
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,400
 "It was just a big joke," if the article starts off with her quote saying, "Dude, he's married to a

187
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,440
 whore and he's paying a whore. When he's married to a whore and his drug addicted freak, should have

188
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,920
 been your first sentence." And then the second allegation about the dog story and then him admitting

189
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,200
 he's doing that but using a different thing totally changes how you view the rest of it.

190
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,480
 It's a very, very slow buildup and it's kind of this, "He said, she said, he said, she said thing"

191
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,240
 with these allegations of him doing stuff to her. And then by the end of it, she accuses him of doing

192
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,280
 something and he's going, "Yes, I did do that. I just didn't use a tiny bucket. I used the giant tub."

193
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:44,000
 Interesting. I don't know what the motive was of the author. If there was any motive at all,

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,280
 he or she, I don't remember who wrote it, but they may have thought that the sexual allegations were

195
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,240
 more like immediate and more reader worthy. But again, because we just live in a society where

196
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,360
 people will question those things kind of right off the bat, but less people question stuff about

197
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,560
 like animal abuse. Super weird. That's the story of Jim Cummings and an interesting look at how

198
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:17,360
 writers structure their stories. This is an ongoing case, but... And I want a little bit of credit

199
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,160
 for not doing Tigger Impressions, not the whole episode, or Eeyore Impressions. I did do a dark

200
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:33,840
 wingtuck joke, but it's a serious topic, man. Serious topic. Sorry for recording it. I'll just

201
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,520
 sit over here and wait to do the other segment because nobody liked that one. Oh, bother. So let's

202
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,040
 go ahead and move on. Let's move away. I always hate doing episodes where there's a bunch of like

203
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,120
 sex assaults because I can't do jokes. I can't do jokes during that stuff. It's rough. It's rough

204
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,480
 for me. So let's go ahead and move on to a murder. These ones are generally easier to do.

205
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,000
 And actually, let me say this right off the bat. We'll cover the murder today. This story was

206
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,960
 recommended by Gary via email, and his email was basically, "Hey, check out this weird colt

207
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
 that recently had a murder connected to it. Sounds like it's right up your alley." And that,

208
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,560
 basically, the research for that gave me four episodes worth of stuff. So we're going to go

209
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:32,000
 ahead and start that today. Now, today let's cover the murder. And tomorrow we'll actually go a little

210
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,320
 more into who Sherry Shreiner is. But there's so much stuff going. She has like 14 different websites.

211
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,560
 A relatively huge following. It's such a bizarre story. But let's start with the catalyst right

212
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,480
 now. Thanks, Gary, for the email. But it really cost me like a ton of time researching this. Whenever

213
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,440
 I thought I was like ready to go with the episode, I was like, "Oh, now I got an Orgon. Oh, so I had

214
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,360
 to go research more about Orgon and all that. So we'll get into that. That'll be its own episode.

215
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,280
 But let's go ahead and start with the murder right now. That's a good way to break it up. First,

216
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
 we'll talk about the murder and then tomorrow. And it's not going to be every episode just all

217
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
 about that. But I think it's easier to piece it up rather than a gloss over a bunch of it.

218
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:23,200
 The year is 2017. The date? July 15th. It's 11 days after the 4th of July. America's

219
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:34,480
 birthday, some would say. Okay, I can stop doing this. Anyways, all the marchers are gone. All the

220
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
 fireworks are put out. You're like, "Jason, I know what happens after Friday the 3rd." Not Friday.

221
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,840
 I know what happens after 4th of July. They should, Friday the 13th should be the new national holiday.

222
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,400
 We'd have like 10 of them a year. But anyways, so July 4th, I don't forget July 4th. It's July 15th,

223
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:00,240
 2017. There's a little house in a place that sounds delightful, Toby Hannah, Pennsylvania.

224
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,040
 That sounds very American, although I'm pretty sure that name has some German roots.

225
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,960
 Sounds American, Toby Hannah. In this little house, a bungalow, maybe? There lived a couple

226
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:22,640
 named Steve Maneo and Barbara Rogers. Now, we know one thing for sure. One of these people ends up dead.

227
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,640
 But there's two versions of the events. And I want to start with the version that was remotely viewed

228
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,960
 by a seer, a soldier, actually a general in God's army, Sherrie Schreiner.

229
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,960
 Sherrie Schreiner had been following the lives of Steve and Barbara very closely. They actually used

230
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,280
 to be disciples of hers, fans, however you want to put it. They were followers of Sherrie Schreiner.

231
00:22:51,280 --> 00:23:00,000
 Sherrie Schreiner is a woman who believes that reptilian, demonic entities, alien things are

232
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,560
 attacking us. They can skull scalp us and take our souls out and then put their own in. People

233
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,960
 can just be regular reptiles. All that shapeshifting reptilian stuff, but you can become a reptile

234
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,040
 like by force. Like one of these guys can get you and you're like no, no, no. And they like suck

235
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,280
 your skull out. Well, I'm sorry, suck your soul out and then put their reptile soul in it. So then

236
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,920
 they still kind of look like you, but they can't regulate their own body temperature. Again, I

237
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,040
 think the reptilian conspiracy is one of the dumbest things because basically everyone would be

238
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,840
 laying on rocks all the time. That's how you could tell they were a reptile. So these reptiles,

239
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:48,400
 the reptilians can go into your body and she began warning Steve, Barbara, I think Barbara

240
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,600
 has been soul scout. I think Barbara has been replaced with a reptilian soul.

241
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,080
 Now her big following was on Facebook, dozens of websites, tons of stuff, and we'll get into

242
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,200
 more detail with Sherry Shreiner when we explore her life. But right now she has a sizable community

243
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,240
 online and she interacted with them regularly, which is quite odd, which is definitely odd

244
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,520
 detail. We've covered a lot of these kind of weird wacky conspiracies before, but she was in

245
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,760
 contact with her fans or followers or disciples on Facebook. So people were posting stuff.

246
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:37,120
 And so a schism started to happen between Barbara and Steve and Sherry. According to Sherry, she said,

247
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,960
 this here's what happened. I started to tell Steve that I think Barbara was turning into a reptilian.

248
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,840
 Sherry actually made a YouTube video showing photos of Barbara Rogers

249
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,960
 and in the video saying, look, you see how her eyes are in this frame. She's a reptile.

250
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,520
 She's a reptile, Steve. So Barbara in retaliation for basically being called a reptile

251
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,280
 starts leaning on Steve and says, we need to leave this cult. This is a cult. This woman's toxic.

252
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,240
 She's telling us that I'm a reptile. I'm not a reptile. You know I'm not a reptile.

253
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:20,400
 Steve Fills pulled between these two women. One, a seer, a prophet of God, and the other one

254
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,600
 the girl he's having sex with. And he's torn between these two. But eventually,

255
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,480
 the one you bang wins out. That's just the way the world works. And he leaves Sherry's cult.

256
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,920
 During this time, Barbara also posted online a video of her eating steak tartar, which I guess is

257
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,720
 like bloody meat or raw meat or something like that. And she's like, I'm not a reptile. I just love

258
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,400
 eating bloody meat. And that really sent Sherry off. She's like, no, she's the only people who are

259
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,760
 half reptile eat bloody meat. So anyways, we're back to July 15th, 11 days after 4th of July.

260
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:05,280
 And Sherry has a vision. She sees this in her head, her God given powers, literally God given.

261
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:16,320
 Barbara and Steve are in bed. And Barbara is watching Resident Evil, which is based on a true story

262
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,280
 that the character, not the zombie taken of the world, but the character Alice, the super

263
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,960
 soldier Alice, is a real human that both Sherry Shreiner and Barbara Rogers know in real life.

264
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,120
 This is according to Sherry. This is according to me. I don't believe this. But Barbara Rogers says

265
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,000
 she was watching Resident Evil, and that's a documentary basically. That's a real story.

266
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,520
 But she didn't know that. And seeing the blood in Resident Evil, whichever one, probably the third

267
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,440
 one, which was the best, seeing the blood in Resident Evil drove Barbara Rogers insane.

268
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:59,520
 Started turning into a reptile form. At this point, Steve is almost a bystander in his own story,

269
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,000
 because it's mostly been about these two women going head to head. He says, "Sherry was right! No!"

270
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,440
 And Barbara grabs the gun as her face is contorting into a reptilian face and begins firing.

271
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,560
 Steve starts running through the house, Jason Bourne style, but gets a bullet through the leg,

272
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:26,720
 falls down, and then Barbara walks up to Steve, puts the gun to his head, and blows his brains out.

273
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,040
 Now, we don't know if any of that happened. What we do know is that on July 15th, late at night,

274
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:41,440
 neighbors heard a "pop, pop, pop, pop!" Nobody called the cops. But eventually, Barbara calls the

275
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,760
 cops herself and says, "I just shot my boyfriend in the head." And when the cops show up, there's a

276
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,120
 young man with his brains blown out and a bullet right through the middle of his head. And Barbara

277
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,720
 goes, "This is what happened. He believes that Sherry Schreiner is a reptile, and he couldn't deal

278
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,600
 with the fact that the woman that he followed for so long was reptilian. So he put the gun to his

279
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,920
 own head and begged me to pull the trigger, and I didn't want to. I really didn't want to, but he

280
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,800
 begged me to because he couldn't deal with the knowledge that Sherry Schreiner, God's prophet,

281
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:26,000
 is a reptile. So I pulled the trigger. Now, obviously, the cops have no idea who Sherry Schreiner is,

282
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,400
 and it's one of those interesting things about cults. Cults are like emo bands. Cults are like

283
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,720
 those bands you've never heard of, because to you, it's like the best band ever. You're like,

284
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,160
 "Oh, Cheety-O's, this is the greatest band." Like, nobody else knows who they are. Or is it Chiotis?

285
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,920
 It doesn't matter. Nobody else knows who they are, but if you're into that music scene, they're

286
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,560
 like the best, and they are pretty good. But this is the same thing with a cult. That cult

287
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,680
 dominates your life, so you just assume everyone else kind of knows about the cult, unless it's

288
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,440
 supposed to be some secret underground satanic cult. You'd have people like Sherry Schreiner being like,

289
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
 "The world's against us, but we are the knowledgeable ones." And everyone's like, "Yay, well, they're

290
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,080
 not in the person. They're all clapping at their type and clapping in Facebook." But you know what I

291
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,920
 mean? Like, you would assume everyone would know who Sherry Schreiner is, if that was all you knew.

292
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,040
 The cops are like, "We have no idea what you're talking about, dude. We have no idea what's going

293
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:28,640
 on here." Now, she--this happened back in 2017. She was just recently convicted in March of 2019.

294
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,360
 She was convicted of third-degree murder. So, she'll be sentenced this upcoming June.

295
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,680
 Sherry has pretty much gone silent. Her YouTube channels haven't really posted anything. A lot

296
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,840
 of YouTube channels, so I could be wrong on this, but her main ones haven't posted anything in about a year.

297
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,600
 Barbara and Steve had YouTube channels where they were speaking out against Sherry, talking about

298
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,880
 how deceptive she was and how she was trying to come in between the relationship. All this stuff,

299
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,640
 all this horrible stuff. Those videos have all been deleted. The channel's been deleted. There

300
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,880
 was no, as far as I could tell, mirror uploads. So, these two--basically, all that's left as an

301
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:21,040
 archive online is Sherry's videos talking trash about Steve and Barbara and how I know when Steve

302
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,760
 died, he saw her as a reptile. I consented. I can--I traveled there in my mind. I have these powers.

303
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,840
 His last words were, "Sherry was right about you and you blew his brains out, you horrible woman."

304
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,680
 And Barbara really has no response to any of this. She's in jail right now. She's probably going to

305
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:47,040
 end up in prison. Sherry accuses her to this day of being a vampire witch, reptilian, super soldier.

306
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:54,320
 It's when we get into a lot of Sherry's personal stuff, you'll see how she just throws terms together.

307
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,720
 And the crazy thing is, is that people really fall for this. But that's the murder that's going

308
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,680
 to open up this world of Sherry Shreiner. We're going to take a look. We're going to take kind of an

309
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,080
 in-depth look into the different facets of her beliefs. Most of them flat out just bizarre

310
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,160
 ludicy that we're going to make fun of. But there seems to be an undercurrent to all of it.

311
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,960
 She believes she has special powers over everyone else. She believes that God has anointed her,

312
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,080
 that she's the granddaughter of David. King David, David and Goliath David,

313
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,080
 granddaughter somehow that works out. But anyways, the granddaughter of David,

314
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,200
 she was sent here by God to destroy the evil ones and raise up the good ones

315
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:52,400
 for this new kingdom of heaven. Obviously, that's all as stupid as possible. But, but, but, but,

316
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:59,600
 she claims she has all of these powers through prayer to strike down her enemies.

317
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:08,160
 And then she takes care of two of them in one night. One of them goes insane, saying,

318
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,920
 "She's a reptile, she's a reptile, kill me, kill me, kill me." And the other one pulls the trigger.

319
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:22,640
 When somebody constantly talks about them having God's power over people, you dismiss it out of

320
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:34,560
 hand. But when their enemies start to be taken off the board, you have to wonder, who is Sherry Shreiner?
