1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A bizarre tragedy in Sweden reminds us what happens when some people take conspiracies

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 a little too far, and then we travel back in time to ancient America to take a look at

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,280
 two stories involving Native Americans and alien visitors.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:25,480
 Is it possible that tribes that had been uncontacted by the Europeans had already had advanced

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,000
 contact with people from another world?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, hope you guys are having a great

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 day too, hope you guys are still having a great day after this episode.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,120
 This one's a wild one, it's a little dark, but let's turn on the lights and welcome

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,640
 in one of our legacy Patreon supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, a long

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
 time supporter of the show, give it up for Ragecat.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
 Meow meow, come on in, I guess it's not very Ragecat noise, but Ragecat you're gonna be

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
 our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand,

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,440
 just help spread the word about the show that really really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,000
 Also just letting you know, as I'm trying to do this intro, my tummy's a little rumbly,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,880
 I'm super hungry and I don't know if I'll be able to edit it out, you're like Jason

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
 just wait, just wait to do the podcast later.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,760
 No, I'm gonna do it now, but my tummy's super growly, I don't know if I'll be able to edit

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 it all out.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's not an EVP, it's not a ghost, if you hear a murmuring it's my stomach, actually

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,520
 ordered, this is the new world we live in, I could have walked to Walmart and bought

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,800
 some chili and it would have taken me probably about an hour round trip to walk there and

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 back.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:57,000
 Instead I ordered chili from Walmart.com and it's taken several days to get here, but

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 supposedly it's supposed to come today.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,360
 I do have other food in my house by the way, I'm not starving, but I really really really

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,400
 want to eat some chili so I'm waiting.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,440
 I'm waiting to get my chili so it's interfering with my podcast, it's actually rumbly through

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
 the podcast.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,960
 Ragecat, let's go ahead and toss you the oars for the Dead Rabbit Robo, we're gonna leave

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,800
 behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're gonna row, row, row all the way across the ocean to

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,840
 Switzerland, splash, splash, rowing all the way out there.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,520
 If you guys don't know I do have my TikTok channel @DeadRabbitRadio and that is exclusively

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,960
 true crime at this point, I really cover all of my true crime stuff and the reason I love

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,040
 true crime, I read all of these crime websites all the time, one thing I've realized is there's

37
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,200
 a lot of true crime I want to cover but to be honest, by the time I did the intro and

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,040
 we got in the vehicle I could cover the story, most of these stories can be covered in a

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,480
 minute but every show, so if you really want more true crime content, go to TikTok, go

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,240
 to my @DeadRabbitRadio because I put out stuff every day almost, just like the show.

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,760
 But some of the stuff I come across is just, I really want to get into, it's true crime

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,400
 related but it's just I can't cover it in a minute and this story in particular is one

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 of those stories that I originally was just like I'll just do it for the TikTok channel

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,600
 and the more I looked into it, the creepier it got and I really wanted to spend some time

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 talking about it.

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,680
 So Ragecat, let's go ahead and pull this boat ashore in Switzerland, we're in the city

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,520
 of Monttrue, Switzerland.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,600
 This story just happened on March 24th, 2022 and I did a quick check before I started recording

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,760
 this, still no additional news, this story is insane, literally, really.

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,880
 March 24th, 2022, it's around 6.15 in the morning.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,920
 These two police officers, they show up at this apartment complex, it's an eight story

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,320
 apartment complex but their destination is the seventh story.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,200
 And on the seventh floor lived a family and these police here were just here for a totally

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,080
 routine visit.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,320
 The way it's set up in Switzerland and I believe this is the same with other countries as well,

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,200
 is if you homeschool your children, every year you get checked on, every year there's

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,360
 a government agency set up to make sure that the children are getting the education that

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,960
 they need, that they're at the grade level they're supposed to be at.

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
 So this governing body will call you up and say, "Hey, we need to set up an appointment

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,880
 so we can actually audit the child or test them, however they do it, to make sure that

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
 he's at grade level."

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,840
 Because what's happening is in this apartment, there's two children, there's a 15 year old

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,080
 boy and an eight year old girl but currently only the 15 year old boy is being homeschooled

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
 through this system.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,120
 And the agency calls up the family and says, "Hey, we need a schedule and appointment to

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,160
 make sure that everything's going fine, this is the yearly thing we do, it's totally normal."

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 And they don't get a call back, the agency does not get a call back, so okay, let's move

68
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
 to the next level.

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,480
 They send out a letter, "Hey, we tried calling you, we're not getting any response, please

70
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,700
 call us between these times so we can set up this very routine thing, we do it once a

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,400
 year, that make sure your child is at a certain educational level that they're getting the

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,840
 education they need."

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,160
 Multiple letters go out, the letters go unanswered.

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 So now they're sending out the police, now the police aren't there to arrest him, the

75
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,800
 police aren't there to test them, they're not going in with their pencils and their

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,360
 two pencils to fill out, they're just there to, "Hey, we've been sent out here by this

77
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,760
 governing body to schedule a time for you to set up this test."

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,600
 And then if they don't respond to the police officers, which of course everyone, everyone

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,560
 responds to the police officers, then you start a court process where the court comes

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,640
 in, this is super routine, it normally doesn't get to this level, even the police officers

81
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,500
 showing up, most people answer the phone and then if they don't then those people get the

82
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 letters, but the police are part of this process, it's super routine.

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,260
 So at 6.15 am when these police officers are going up to the seventh story of this apartment

84
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,920
 complex to knock on this door and just to get this person to set up an appointment, super

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,320
 routine, these two police officers have no idea they're about to set a tragic series of

86
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:22,600
 events into motion that will probably never have any answers to what really happened behind

87
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
 this door.

88
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,140
 The police knock on this door, at 6.15 they hear a male voice on the other side of the

89
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,060
 door say, "Who is it?"

90
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:37,620
 The police officers identify themselves, "We're the police."

91
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,140
 Now they don't hear any answer after that.

92
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:49,140
 And this isn't a kick down the door worthy event, they're just there, it's totally routine,

93
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,940
 I have to keep nailing that in because the story just goes so sideways, they're just

94
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,680
 there to be part of this process and they don't hear anything on the other side of the

95
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,520
 door so they leave.

96
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
 They just walked away.

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 Now I'm sure there was a fourth level, I don't think it was SWAT coming in with a bunch of

98
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,960
 math books and pencils and they're like, "You're gonna fill out this test right in front of

99
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
 us young man."

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,200
 There is probably, at that point the police would probably leave and there would probably

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,040
 be like a court order or something like that for them to show up and the process would

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 continue.

103
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,840
 Now this is a true crime podcast but the crime isn't that they just refused to do

104
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,900
 the homeschooling thing, obviously something much darker is going on.

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,580
 So the police leave, that'll happen around 6.15 a.m., sometime between 6.15 and 7 a.m.

106
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:43,540
 What happened was the family in this apartment, they all took off their shoes.

107
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,020
 In this house you had the husband, they have not released any of these people's names,

108
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,600
 but in this house you had the husband, he was 40, you had his 41 year old wife, you

109
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,900
 had her twin sister, who's also living in this apartment, and then the couple's 8 year

110
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,420
 old daughter and 15 year old son.

111
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,600
 Between 6.15 and 7 a.m. they took their shoes off.

112
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,560
 At 7 a.m. while people are still waking up, making their breakfast, drinking their coffee,

113
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,060
 reading the news.

114
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,580
 The residents in this apartment complex hear a BOOM!

115
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,060
 It's a startling sound, a loud sound.

116
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,580
 You can't really place it at first.

117
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,860
 And maybe you went back to reading the newspaper or drinking your coffee or eating your eggs.

118
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,440
 But a few curious residents of the apartment complex looked out their window, opened their

119
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,120
 sliding glass door and peeked over their balcony.

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:04,400
 What had happened was the family, all 5 of them, jumped off of their 7th story balcony

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,200
 at the same time.

122
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,120
 They all tumbled to the ground and hit the pavement.

123
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,900
 Four of them, dead on impact.

124
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,540
 The father, the mother, the sister-in-law, and the 8 year old daughter.

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,860
 The 15 year old boy lived, but is in a coma.

126
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,340
 That's as recent as news we have.

127
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,140
 Now long time listeners of Dead Rappor Radio, I've talked about this once or twice on the

128
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,900
 show, one of the signs that police look for over whether something is a suicide, an accidental

129
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,160
 death, or a murder.

130
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,760
 This weird quirk of suicide is that people who commit suicide tend to take their shoes

131
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
 off before they do it.

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 Because shoes are uncomfortable.

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 The only reason we wear shoes is to protect our feet.

134
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,000
 We might pick nicer shoes to go to the club or more athletic shoes to do certain events,

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 but for the most part shoes are just something we have to protect our feet.

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,520
 And if you are going to kill yourself, why do you need to protect your feet?

137
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,180
 And again, most shoes are just uncomfortable to begin with.

138
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,260
 Just the thought of "I hate wearing shoes personally, I do because I have to protect

139
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
 my feet."

140
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,220
 But when I come home, the first thing I do is take off my shoes.

141
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,940
 And pretty much all of my other clothing too.

142
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,140
 Walking around in shorts pretty much most of the time.

143
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,740
 But they all took off their shoes and they all jumped off of the balcony.

144
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,980
 Now the police believe that they all did this at the exact same time because everyone heard

145
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,560
 a single sound of them all hitting.

146
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,480
 So they don't think it was a murder/suicide.

147
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,960
 They're not really classifying it as that.

148
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
 Everyone jumped off the balcony.

149
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,080
 Now obviously the 8 year old girl and arguably the 15 year old boy, they're not capable of

150
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,520
 making such a permanent decision.

151
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,720
 Their brains aren't fully developed.

152
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,560
 So yeah, you could argue murder, but it wasn't like the dad or the mom were throwing the

153
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
 kids over.

154
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,160
 They all jumped.

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,500
 Apparently there was a step ladder on the balcony.

156
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,220
 So the younger person could get off and jump themselves.

157
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,060
 Terrifying story.

158
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,900
 And police don't know what to make of it.

159
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,660
 There was a news article that kind of connected them to a cult, but the neighbors have come

160
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,220
 out and said "No, they weren't really cultish.

161
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,980
 In fact, we didn't really even see them that much, but there was nothing about them that

162
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,280
 would make us think they were in some sort of cult."

163
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,920
 However, one of the latest articles I found was April 1st in the New York Times.

164
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,240
 And they stated that apparently as the police were investigating, as they're going into

165
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,480
 the apartment and stuff like that, that they had a bunch of food stocked up and they seemed

166
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,800
 to take a real, if not a cult following, not a cult belief thing, they began to get really

167
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,480
 into conspiracy theories during the COVID panic.

168
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,100
 Like before that, just an average family, homeschooling their kid, whatever.

169
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
 I don't care about homeschooling.

170
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,620
 I'm not pro or anti it.

171
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,540
 It's a fine enough choice, right?

172
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,180
 That's not what this is about.

173
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,260
 But apparently during COVID, whatever was going on in that home became amplified.

174
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,060
 And the conspiracy theories and the survivalism, which did to everyone, people who never hoarded

175
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,420
 food before toilet paper, had to do that just as a means.

176
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,600
 They said this family took it overboard.

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 Right?

178
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,480
 So they're just a normal homeschooling family, but isolated from the world.

179
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,760
 Apparently the twin sister was the only one who had a job outside the apartment.

180
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,560
 She was the only one who left the place regularly and he had all these people living together.

181
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,320
 You know, hopefully a loving family until obviously what this isn't a preferable ending.

182
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
 This is a horrible ending.

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,620
 But what I'm saying is like it seemed to just be a family and then they fell off the deep end.

184
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,060
 Because they were for them to be homeschooling the sun in previous years, they would have

185
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,140
 had to respond to these communiques from the government.

186
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,140
 It was this year that something changed.

187
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,280
 Totally routine police visit, but that set something off in the family that caused a

188
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,660
 mass suicide.

189
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,940
 And that is something we tend to only see in cults.

190
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,640
 Unfortunately we do see a lot of murder suicides, but a group suicide.

191
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,880
 Right again they said, I saw one article said they went one after another, but every other

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,920
 article said it was a single sound.

193
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,000
 And I honestly, I feel bad for the family.

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I feel bad for the son.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,500
 You know, he's in a coma.

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,160
 Like again, he'll probably never come out of it.

197
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 And I feel bad for those police officers as well.

198
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,520
 It was just a routine morning for them knocking on a door.

199
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,760
 You know they're going to carry that till they're grave.

200
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,740
 Like what if we had kicked in the door?

201
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
 Why didn't we do something more?

202
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
 But they couldn't.

203
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,940
 Legally they couldn't.

204
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,220
 And they never even thought that they would need to.

205
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,580
 They go back court with issue of summons and then go and do a whole process.

206
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,900
 Mass suicide in Switzerland.

207
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
 Insane.

208
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,180
 It's just a creepy story.

209
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,860
 It's a creepy true crime story.

210
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,060
 And it's a creepy story of what happens when you take conspiracy theories too far.

211
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,380
 I love conspiracy theories.

212
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,500
 There are conspiracy theories that I do believe in.

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,320
 I love researching all conspiracy theories and goings.

214
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Could this be true?

215
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Could this not be true?

216
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
 I'm kind of taking it apart and putting it back together.

217
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,720
 I love the theory of conspiracy theories and there are ones that I think are true.

218
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 Right?

219
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,360
 But I don't think really any of them are worth...

220
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,920
 I think this should go without saying.

221
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,200
 I don't think any of them are worth killing yourself and your family or convincing your

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 family.

223
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,080
 It's time to jump off this balcony into oblivion and hit the pavement.

224
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
 Terrifying.

225
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,380
 Terrifying story.

226
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,380
 Terrifying true crime story.

227
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,580
 And it's really falling under the radar.

228
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,920
 Actually, when the article popped up, I thought it was going to be kind of a bigger look at

229
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,460
 like what caused this and stuff like...

230
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,020
 But I guess the world is so chaotic that when an entire family kills themselves, again,

231
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,340
 not a murder/suicide.

232
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,980
 This wasn't people being thrown over a balcony.

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,300
 I guess the world's too chaotic to even take notice of a tragedy like this.

234
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,940
 That was kind of a downer.

235
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,680
 I didn't actually expect it to go on that long either.

236
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,720
 But Ragecat, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonary copter for those of

237
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,840
 you who are still around hugging your loved ones.

238
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,000
 Ragecat, let's go ahead and leave behind Switzerland.

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,760
 We are headed all the way out to British Columbia.

240
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,420
 Yesterday I talked about this website.

241
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,940
 I knew that I was going to cover it again, but I didn't know I was going to cover it

242
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
 so closely.

243
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,140
 There's a website called UFOBC.ca.

244
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,780
 It's a website that's dedicated to UFO encounters in British Columbia, in Canada in total, but

245
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,340
 they really specify the British Columbia area.

246
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
 Really cool website.

247
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,580
 The fact that we're covering it on two different days back to back should show how much cool

248
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,500
 stuff we found from there.

249
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,320
 First off, we're headed out to Prince Rupert, British Columbia.

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,360
 There's a place called Roberson Point out there.

251
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,160
 We're going back in time to visit the Sim-Schein tribe that once controlled the area of Roberson

252
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
 Point.

253
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,680
 This is far back in time before the Europeans showed up.

254
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,480
 There's a village called Metlachala.

255
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
 Metlachala.

256
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,640
 And in this village there's a man.

257
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,200
 He's going to be exiled.

258
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,740
 Let's call him Terry.

259
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,580
 So Terry's like, "Oh come on man, you can't exile me."

260
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,860
 I know I did all that stuff that's exiled worthy, but come on.

261
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,180
 I'm a cool guy, man.

262
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
 Exile that guy over there.

263
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
 That dude's super lame.

264
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,500
 And they're like, "No, we're going to exile you."

265
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,700
 And that guy's over there crying.

266
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,820
 We're like, "We're going to exile you twice."

267
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,980
 Now we're making that lame guy cry.

268
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,780
 So Terry gets exiled and he's like, "Ahhh."

269
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,980
 And he's like just kind of complaining as he walks away.

270
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,100
 A couple days later people are just hanging out in the village doing their thing.

271
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,600
 And they see Terry walking back towards the village.

272
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,680
 And they're like, "Hey, didn't we just exile this guy?

273
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
 What's he doing?

274
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,040
 Does he not know the definition of the word 'exile'?"

275
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,600
 And Terry walks in and he's been star-cut.

276
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,720
 And Terry walks back and he's been starving, right?

277
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,760
 It's been a couple days and he's like, "Oh, I'm so hungry.

278
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
 I'm so hungry."

279
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,120
 And they're like, "Yeah, that's part of what being exiled is, bro.

280
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,280
 It's a punishment.

281
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
 Get out of here."

282
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
 And he's like, "No, no, no, no, no.

283
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
 Hold on, hold on.

284
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,160
 I know you guys are going to try to kick me out again, but I have a story to tell you."

285
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,100
 And they're like, "Okay, what's your story?

286
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,380
 We're not going to give you a cheeseburger.

287
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
 What's your story?"

288
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,140
 And he goes, "I fell from the sky.

289
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,660
 I was out walking and something picked me up and took me to the heavens and then dropped

290
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
 to me."

291
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,980
 And people are like, "Okay, that would be fair.

292
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,980
 That is a cheeseburger worthy story, but we don't believe you.

293
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
 You better be telling the truth.

294
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,500
 You better be telling the truth.

295
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,320
 Get some magical force, picked you up, and threw you down from the heavens.

296
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 Because if not, you're going to get exiled again."

297
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,240
 And he's like, "I totally understand that.

298
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,800
 Totally get the exiled thing."

299
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,640
 So he goes, "I got proof for you, though.

300
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 So let me show you."

301
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,480
 So they all walked back to this area.

302
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
 He goes, "Look, that is where I landed."

303
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,640
 Townspeople are like, "Whoa, dude."

304
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,920
 And there in the rock is the outline of a man.

305
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,260
 And I'm not like a drawing, not like a chalk outline.

306
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,580
 There's an indentation in the rock of a human body.

307
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,860
 And they welcome Terry back as a shaman.

308
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,660
 They're like, "Dude, if he got chosen by the gods and then was thrown back down from

309
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,620
 the heavens and survived, this guy needs to be elevated.

310
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,780
 Exiled Schmuck-Sile.

311
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,260
 Let's go exile that lame guy.

312
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,340
 The shaman has spoken.

313
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,860
 He's welcomed back as a shaman.

314
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,140
 What's interesting is this peck...

315
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,380
 This is not like a legend.

316
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,000
 Well, technically it is, right?

317
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But this is...

318
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
 It's called a petroglyph.

319
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 It still exists.

320
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,880
 They actually...

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,160
 You can actually visit this.

322
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,480
 It is in the rock the outline of a man.

323
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,120
 It's like if you took a dude, you can actually recreate this.

324
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,920
 Take a G.I. Joe action figure or a Lego action figure, it doesn't matter.

325
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,680
 And take some Play-Doh and push down the Lego man into the Play-Doh and then pull him out.

326
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,520
 That's what happened.

327
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,940
 It's like a perfect indentation of a human in a rock.

328
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,020
 There will be photos in the show notes if you don't have action figures in Play-Doh.

329
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
 But it still exists.

330
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
 You can go visit it.

331
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,660
 Now it's in kind of a remote region.

332
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:47,020
 So they have a local museum that has a fiberglass replica of it in the museum of Northern B.C.

333
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,100
 That museum there, you can go and be like, "Whoa, look at it.

334
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
 Look at it."

335
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,540
 A representation of that.

336
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,340
 But if you have the gear and if you get permission, you can go and see the original thing.

337
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,720
 And I'm reading this and I'm looking at this photo and I'm like, "Dude, this is nuts.

338
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,520
 This would be proof of aliens to be taken up in the sky in the first place, right?

339
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,600
 Before airplanes, before hot air balloons and then drop and survive."

340
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,320
 That's really cool.

341
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,520
 But I start looking and I was like, "Obviously, this might not be true.

342
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
 I'm not going.

343
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 What?"

344
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
 That's amazing.

345
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
 Let's talk about it.

346
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
 I start to dig a little bit more into it and there's actually different versions of the

347
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
 story.

348
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
 The rock does exist.

349
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,660
 And the more I was looking at the photos and the more I was reading other stories of it,

350
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:35,460
 I started to think, "Hmm, it does look like the image of a human in a rock.

351
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,100
 It's not like a trick of the light.

352
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,580
 That's obviously what it is."

353
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,180
 But it looks almost too much like a human in a rock.

354
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:52,340
 It would be the difference of if you ran through a wall and you smashed a hole in the wall,

355
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,120
 or if you ran through a wall and you left a perfect impression of your arms raised,

356
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,600
 like everything breaks perfectly around you, so it looks like a human walked through a

357
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 wall.

358
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 You know what I mean?

359
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 That's what this looked like.

360
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 It looked too perfect.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
 There was another version of the story where a guy was already a shaman in the area and

362
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,960
 he goes, "You know what, guys?

363
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,760
 This is cool and all, but it's time for me to learn from the sky.

364
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,880
 Earth is cool and all, but I think I could learn more stuff from up there, from the sky."

365
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,620
 So he left the village and then he came back a couple of days later and says, "Dude, you

366
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
 won't believe it.

367
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,180
 I went to the sky and I stayed there and I learned all this cool stuff, but there's

368
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,020
 no food in the sky.

369
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,660
 So I came back to Earth, actually fell all the way to Earth and hit this rock and now

370
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,420
 do you have a cheeseburger?"

371
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,380
 Both times the person starved, no matter what version it is.

372
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,740
 And he took them to the rock and they saw it.

373
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,220
 And it's kind of...

374
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,660
 People nowadays, like scientists nowadays, you know, party poopers, you don't believe

375
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,600
 that space aliens are surviving 30,000 foot drops.

376
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,520
 They think that the story...

377
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,200
 One of these stories is true and someone did leave the village, whether they were exiled

378
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,560
 or they went willingly and they carved this image.

379
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,680
 And then they went back and said, "Hey, I just came from the sky and brought them over."

380
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,240
 That's kind of where people kind of sit on this one.

381
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,680
 People go, "It's obviously real.

382
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,160
 We can look at it, but we think somebody carved it.

383
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,320
 We don't think someone actually fell from the sky."

384
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,820
 And the idea of aliens interacting, which was what this would be, right?

385
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,340
 Obviously it could be paranormal, it could be deities, it could be gods working with

386
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,420
 them.

387
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
 But the idea...

388
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,820
 I think the kind of idea that if anything was going to do this in any sort of scientific

389
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,180
 way, it would be aliens.

390
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,340
 But Ragecat, let's keep that carbonicopter in the air.

391
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,460
 This episode might run a little bit long, but I really want to get to this story.

392
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,180
 This is super awesome.

393
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,860
 And hopefully it's a good counterbalance to how depressing the episode started off.

394
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,480
 We're staying in the general area.

395
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,160
 We're going to be in the Pacific Northwest coast of Canada, but we're moving a little

396
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,800
 bit ahead in time.

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,640
 We're headed to the late 1700s.

398
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,680
 And there was a man, his name was John Mears.

399
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,920
 He was a member of the Royal Navy that spent a lot of time on this coast of America.

400
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,360
 And when he resigned from the Royal Navy, he actually just wanted to explore on his

401
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 own.

402
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,060
 Did you imagine a lot of times you'd be on some battleship and you're like, "Oh, look

403
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,580
 at those pretty flowers over there."

404
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,900
 And they're like, "John, man the guns.

405
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,820
 Shoot these pirates that are trying to attack us."

406
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,860
 He's like, "Oh, but I want to see the flowers."

407
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,500
 So once he resigns from the Navy, he is able to walk around on his own.

408
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,300
 And he spent a lot of time observing the Newtka tribe, or they're also known as the Newtcha

409
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,020
 Newlth tribe.

410
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,540
 And he wrote of his travels.

411
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,700
 He published his works about all of this time he spent in the Americas.

412
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:52,480
 And between 1778 and 1789, he wandered through the Pacific Northwest coast of Canada.

413
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,820
 And what he did was he wrote of his travels.

414
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,680
 He wrote this book explaining what he was doing between 1778 and 1789, kind of documenting

415
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,360
 the floral and the fauna and the tribes that are in the area.

416
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 One thing he noticed is that the Newtka tribesmen were very familiar with copper.

417
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,500
 He was highly admired by them.

418
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,940
 Which is odd in and of itself.

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,140
 Metalworking was one of the things that Europeans brought to North America.

420
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,700
 Now there were tribes out on the east coast or in the Great Lake area that was very familiar

421
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,220
 with copper.

422
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,700
 But for the most part, and that was an anomaly as well.

423
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,220
 People thought that was weird as well.

424
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,480
 But I'll put it in the show notes.

425
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,280
 In the Great Lakes, the tribes that were really familiar, I think it was copper there as well.

426
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,400
 It was connected to this god, this deity in the Great Lakes area that they loved to copper,

427
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,840
 but they also knew that this was something that this ancient sea beast wanted.

428
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

429
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
 That was a really good one.

430
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,160
 But it is an anomaly.

431
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,240
 And so he thought that was weird.

432
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,160
 He goes, "How are you guys familiar with copper?

433
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,520
 You guys don't have any minds.

434
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,320
 You're definitely not trading it with anyone.

435
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
 Well, now you are.

436
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,260
 So when people show up, when people, travelers and traders come with copper, you definitely

437
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
 want them to know what it is.

438
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,260
 How do you guys know about this stuff?"

439
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,700
 He was told, "Well, we know about copper because a long time ago someone brought that

440
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,460
 metal to us."

441
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,660
 So like before the Europeans got here, who did you have contact with?

442
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,220
 They go, "Well, it wasn't you.

443
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,700
 It definitely wasn't you.

444
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,900
 You just showed up a couple of years ago.

445
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,680
 It actually wasn't anyone from your country.

446
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,700
 It wasn't anyone from your continent.

447
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
 They came from the sky."

448
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,260
 And he's told this story.

449
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:52,720
 One day a copper canoe flew down from the heavens and it was piloted by a man.

450
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,400
 And everything this man had was made of metal, which before this they had no knowledge of

451
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 metalworking.

452
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,900
 A man came down in a flying copper canoe.

453
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,380
 Everything he had was made of metal.

454
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,020
 And he came with a warning.

455
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,780
 He told us that one day disaster would befall the Newt K'nation.

456
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,340
 Our people would be killed.

457
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,700
 He brought these warnings with us along with this miraculous metal.

458
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,780
 And it's interesting because the Newt Chanuath tribe was one of the very first tribes on

459
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,880
 the West Coast to encounter Europeans.

460
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,280
 And that had its pluses and its minuses.

461
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,680
 The pluses were they set up some very early trade agreements with the Europeans.

462
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,000
 So they benefited from this European exposure as opposed to the other tribes in the area.

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,920
 They were able to make first contact with the Europeans.

464
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,700
 They were able to establish these trade agreements.

465
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,840
 That was the pro.

466
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,600
 The cons was literally everything else you read about in a history book.

467
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,380
 The pluses began to spread among the Newt Chanuath tribe.

468
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,100
 And they found themselves in the middle of a lot of conflicts involving other European

469
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
 world powers.

470
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:18,260
 You had Spain and Britain fighting over territory that was controlled by the Newt Chanuath tribe.

471
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,780
 And they were now embroiled in all of these conflicts that really were being directed

472
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,500
 from a world away.

473
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,360
 Beefing over trade routes, beefing over access to this water source, to this food source.

474
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,440
 It's never the best place to be to be squeezed between two world powers.

475
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,080
 But the Newt Chanuath tribe, they didn't take it lying down.

476
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,560
 They actually were pretty aggressive on their own towards these empires.

477
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:49,040
 In 1803, the Newt Chanuaths captured an American trading ship.

478
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,160
 And they slaughtered everyone on board.

479
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
 Except for two of them.

480
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,300
 They allowed two of them to live as long as they would be their slaves.

481
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,140
 In 1811, the Newt Kuz took over another trading ship.

482
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,000
 And this was because the captain, the trading ship was known as the Tonquin.

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,180
 The captain of the Tonquin insulted a powerful member of the tribe.

484
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,620
 He actually slapped him with a fur.

485
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,260
 Doesn't say what prompted the slap.

486
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,700
 But this captain of the ship took a fur and slapped this dude over the face.

487
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,680
 You just couldn't stand for that right.

488
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,120
 I mean, I guess there was other ways to resolve this.

489
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,640
 Probably should have slapped the dude in the first place.

490
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,000
 One of their powerful leaders got slapped.

491
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,520
 So what they did was they killed everyone.

492
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,000
 The Newt Kuz slaughtered all of the crew of the Tonquin.

493
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,200
 And because the crew was on land, the crew was there visiting.

494
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,480
 And their captain slapped this guy with a fur.

495
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,380
 And then they said, OK, before we get on our row boats and go back to the ship,

496
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,260
 let's camp here for the night.

497
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,820
 And they were slaughtered.

498
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,860
 And the ship just sat there abandoned for about a day, just floating there.

499
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,060
 And then after a day, the Newt Kuz said, well, let's go salvage the boat.

500
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,140
 They must have all of this great stuff on there.

501
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,060
 They're traders, right?

502
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,340
 They're from this mighty empire, probably full of riches, right?

503
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,860
 So they took the row boats and they went out to the Tonquin and they got on board.

504
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,780
 And they're stealing everything from it.

505
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,460
 They're plundering it.

506
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,840
 What they didn't know is there was a guy hiding on the boat.

507
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,520
 He's probably taking a nap when the captain says, OK, everyone, get in your row boats.

508
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,400
 We're going to go on this trading mission.

509
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,040
 I got my slapping hand ready.

510
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,960
 They're like, what do you have a slapping hand ready?

511
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,000
 But we were just traders.

512
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,200
 And the captain's like, you'll see nothing will go wrong.

513
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
 This guy was sleeping, apparently.

514
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,520
 And he must have woken up to an empty ship.

515
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,160
 And I don't know if it was like a home alone thing.

516
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,600
 He's like, ah, he's looking out the ship.

517
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,960
 He's seeing all the people being slaughtered.

518
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,360
 He's like, ah.

519
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,620
 Then he goes hide on the ship.

520
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,660
 But it does.

521
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,220
 It is kind of a home alone thing.

522
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,660
 I guess he's home alone.

523
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,380
 He's on a boat that requires an entire crew of people to sail.

524
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,900
 He's trapped a world away from his home.

525
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,900
 He's hiding in the boat as all of these dudes are climbing onto the boat and plundering it.

526
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,820
 And there's 100 Newtka tribesmen on the boat.

527
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,180
 It's not like the wet bandits, not just two of them.

528
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,840
 And the only original crew member left is poor Kevin down in the boat.

529
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,880
 And he realizes, you know, obviously these guys have quite a reputation.

530
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,360
 It was just a couple years ago.

531
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,040
 They slaughtered everyone on a boat and took a couple slaves.

532
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,080
 He knows that all of his countrymen have been killed at this point.

533
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:42,680
 The Newtka tribes on this training ship, and this guy is down in the ammo hold.

534
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,360
 I don't know why he was taking his note down there.

535
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,480
 He's like, ah, I love the smell of gunpowder.

536
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
 He just puts me to sleep.

537
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,140
 He's down in the ammo hold.

538
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,100
 There's 100 tribesmen on the boat.

539
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,860
 He knows that he's never getting out of here alive, or if he does, he'll be a slave.

540
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:03,420
 He sets the ammo magazines on fire, and the boat is obliterated.

541
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,180
 It's just this massive explosion.

542
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,460
 It killed 100 members of the tribe.

543
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,140
 And these were warriors.

544
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,780
 This would be the equivalent of half your army being vaporized.

545
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,000
 The equivalent of a nuclear bomb dropping on West Point or something like that.

546
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,280
 Don't come after me if we had this.

547
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,960
 Just an example, I did not make that threat.

548
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,680
 If you had a nuclear bomb vaporized, a huge chunk of your leadership, a huge chunk of

549
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
 your fighting force.

550
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,280
 This was the biggest single loss of life for the Newtka tribe in its entire history.

551
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,400
 100 men dying in a single day by 1830.

552
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,840
 And we, unfortunately, you know, like we're in the future.

553
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,620
 We know the history of the Native Americans and their involvement with the Europeans.

554
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,480
 And so we knew that, because when I started the story out with the canoe man flying down

555
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,420
 from the sky, we know how this story ends, unfortunately, right?

556
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:04,260
 By 1830, 90% of the Newtcha Nulth are dead, specifically of diseases, like smallpox and

557
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,340
 malaria.

558
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,900
 And by the time the 1900s rolled around, they went from this mighty nation controlling this

559
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,280
 part of the world to being around 3,500 people.

560
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,720
 That's all that was left.

561
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,320
 And so we know, looking back, that this was going to happen, unfortunately.

562
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,400
 But remember the man in the flying canoe, he came before the Europeans.

563
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,920
 He came long before all of this stuff.

564
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,720
 And he prophesied that they would be destroyed.

565
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,160
 But not even John Muir knew that at the time.

566
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,180
 Remember, he's visiting them before all of this stuff is going on, before 1831, disease

567
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,100
 really takes hold.

568
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,700
 Before 1811, where they lose 100 men in a single day, he's meeting them long before

569
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,700
 this.

570
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,260
 And he sees that they have access to all of this copper.

571
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,820
 And he hears the prophecy that this tribe will be wiped out.

572
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,500
 And even John Muir's must be thinking, "Oh, this is such a mighty group of people.

573
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 This is a huge nation.

574
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,060
 It would take a lot to wipe them out."

575
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,740
 He doesn't even really know what's coming down the pipe.

576
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,920
 Did he now know about the prophecy?

577
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,440
 And he is informed about this man in the copper canoe, bringing down all of this metal.

578
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,640
 And John Muir's asked, "Well, what happened to the man in the copper canoe?

579
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
 Did he fly away?

580
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,720
 Did he go back home to where he came from?

581
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,240
 He gave this prophecy to you.

582
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,360
 And how did you repay him?"

583
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,920
 And he was told that the newt could try after hearing this warning, killed the man in the

584
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:44,340
 canoe, took all of his metal, took all of his copper, and learned the secrets of metalworking,

585
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:53,940
 not from his teachings, but by reverse engineering, basically, his copper canoe.

586
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,660
 It's an interesting story, and I think it's so fascinating because when we talk about

587
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,780
 aliens coming down, when we look at ancient aliens theories, we have these aliens coming

588
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,200
 down in massive numbers and talking to the Egyptian, if you believe in the ancient aliens

589
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 theory.

590
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,080
 We have these aliens coming down in massive numbers in these great vehicles, and their

591
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,440
 power is indisputable.

592
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,440
 And they teach the Egyptians how to build these pyramids, or you have the aliens coming

593
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,560
 down in their vehicles, and they're teaching the South Americans how to build their great

594
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,040
 cities of the Naskah lines and all of these things.

595
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,520
 And I'm not a huge believer in the ancient aliens theory.

596
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
 I talk about this all the time.

597
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
 I'll put it in the show notes.

598
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,200
 Once again, there's a great documentary called "Ancient Aliens Debunked."

599
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,600
 I'm waiting for YouTube to yank it for copyright violations.

600
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,320
 It's been around for a couple of years, though.

601
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,800
 It's really good to look at all that stuff, but let's just say, for example, that stuff

602
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,000
 happened, right?

603
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,920
 Those weren't the works of great minds of men.

604
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,040
 Those were the works of alien visitors.

605
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,520
 You would have this indisputable power of that.

606
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,000
 And nowadays, when we see aliens, a lot of times they're coming down, and they're usually

607
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,600
 just flying around in their UFOs, but sometimes they come down.

608
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,880
 For the most part, they'll steal a couple cows, they'll probe a couple people, and we

609
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,120
 seem so powerless to them.

610
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,760
 Last week, I covered an episode about a guy who beat an alien to death with a butt of

611
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
 a rifle.

612
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,560
 But for the most part, that's the anomaly, right?

613
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,040
 That's usually just aliens kind of doing what they do, and we're just kind of victims

614
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 of it.

615
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,360
 But when I read this story, I thought, really, the aliens that just kind of visit or either

616
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,760
 come down in numbers and they move an entire society in one direction or another, or they

617
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,080
 come down to someone who's not going to violently murder them, that's the normal UFO lore.

618
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,120
 But you would figure that there would be times where aliens would come across the wrong person,

619
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,360
 like last week when the guy got beaten to death.

620
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,440
 The alien got beaten to death.

621
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,600
 And when I'm reading this story, yes, it's very likely that aliens would have come down

622
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,360
 and met a tribe of people who were like, "Well, okay, that's cool and all that you can find

623
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,160
 from the sky, but we really want your vehicle.

624
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,680
 Let's kill you."

625
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,280
 Imagine if an alien came down.

626
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,160
 Actually, I think we covered this.

627
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
 We did cover this.

628
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
 I'll try to find the episode.

629
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,680
 This alien ship visited.

630
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,360
 It abducted two people during the witch trials, like during that time period.

631
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,280
 Two people went up into the sky and came back and said, "We went to the sky and we were

632
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,160
 dancing around and the space brothers are here to help us."

633
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,000
 And they were burned to the stake.

634
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,120
 These people who talked about going up into the heavens and meeting people from another

635
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,480
 planet were killed.

636
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:43,760
 And you imagine if aliens did come down and met people at the wrong time or in the wrong

637
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,000
 place, not as a show of force, but a single explorer, like how that one guy a couple years

638
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,880
 ago hopped on a boat and went to the Sentinel Island to bring the Bible, to teach the teachings

639
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,160
 of Christianity to the people of Sentinel Island.

640
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,280
 We've talked about it several times in the show, Adelina.

641
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,360
 The island itself, it's an island that is uncontacted.

642
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,160
 They see our airplanes and our helicopters flying overhead, but they kill anyone who comes

643
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
 near them.

644
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,200
 They're considered one of the last known uncontacted tribes on Earth.

645
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,880
 It would be this equivalent, right?

646
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,600
 Someone coming from another planet and an explorer from another world.

647
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,960
 And they could have landed somewhere else.

648
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,560
 This flying canoe could have flown into Spain and gone up to Queen Isabella, Queen Sophia,

649
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,120
 whoever was in charge, and presented himself as a visitor from another world and be treated

650
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,640
 by the court.

651
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 Or he could have shown up in New England during the rule of the Puritans, right?

652
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,760
 Or they're burning people, they're burning their own villagers because they're wheat

653
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
 crop.

654
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,080
 It's 40% less abundant than it used to be.

655
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,840
 What happens when a guy shows up then?

656
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
 He says, "I am from another world.

657
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,560
 It's so nice to meet people on this planet you call Earth."

658
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,960
 They would have killed him on the spot.

659
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,120
 It's interesting to think that all over the world, as much as there are people out there

660
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:20,280
 who want to see the space brothers, who want to have proof of alien life, that's relatively

661
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
 new.

662
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,920
 And I'm saying, like in the past 30 years, before that, during the Cold War, if you came

663
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,720
 to Earth, you were getting shot down.

664
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,920
 If you popped up during any one of the numerous wars that have erupted around this planet,

665
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,280
 you're getting blown out of the sky, no question.

666
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,640
 And if you landed far enough back in the past, you might be considered a god.

667
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,120
 And if you had enough proof, like if you could melt walls with beams and things like that,

668
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,160
 if you could incinerate enemies, you would be considered a god.

669
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,360
 But then once you started having organized religion, if you came down and had the powers

670
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:07,720
 of a god, you were killed on the spot, like global organized religions.

671
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,040
 Or in a place like the Americas, where you don't have these organized religions yet,

672
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,800
 but you have tribes, you may land next to a tribe that goes, "Oh yeah, we do believe

673
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,220
 in the great coyote who lives in the sky, and maybe you are a worker of his, so teach

674
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,000
 us your ways."

675
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,240
 Maybe you picked up our shaman and threw him to the earth, and if so, welcome.

676
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,120
 But the Newtkas weren't messing around.

677
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,600
 But or not, visitor from another world or not, they wanted the medal.

678
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,200
 They wanted the medal more than the message.

679
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,320
 And it actually led them down a path that, that same thing happened to so many other

680
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,960
 tribes native to the Americas.

681
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,480
 The Europeans came and the Europeans wiped them out, whether through disease or through

682
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,080
 tyranny, or both.

683
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,280
 Is it possible that the Newtka could have listened to the message of this man from the

684
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,080
 Copper Canoe and readied themselves and prevented this tragedy?

685
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,600
 It's hard to say because the tragedy was spread across two continents.

686
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,760
 But it definitely didn't help that they killed this man who came from the sky with a warning

687
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
 personalized to them.

688
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,800
 They killed him for his canoe.

689
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:42,920
 They may have discovered Copper and metalworking long before the Europeans showed up.

690
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,680
 But that knowledge did not save them.

691
00:40:46,680 --> 00:41:14,960
 And neither did the Copper that they stole from the man who came to help.

692
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:39,960
