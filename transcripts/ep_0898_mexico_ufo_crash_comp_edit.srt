00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 When a fast food worker is fired from an Arby's restaurant, he discovers the PERFECT revenge.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,020
 And then we travel to Mexico to take a look at a minute by minute account of what happens

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,080
 after a UFO crashes.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,440
 While the Mexican government AND the CIA are both rushing to the scene of this fallen alien

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,960
 ship, little do they know they're both about to become participants.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,840
 In a mass casualty event.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,560
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:46,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,880
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,560
 Hope you guys had a fun weekend.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,960
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna go ahead and get started right away.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,600

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,480
 Now Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,320
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,840
 We are gonna fly all the way out to Missouri.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
 And I hope you guys brought a lunch, but I hope you guys have not eaten it yet.

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,120
 Because this story is disgusting, not just because we're going to an Arby's, the worst

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
 of all fast food restaurants.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,320
 I would rather live in a Long John Silver's than eat at an Arby's.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,880
 Long John Silver's isn't that bad, but imagine if you're trying to sleep.

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,960
 People don't live in Long John Silver's, but you know they ring that bell whenever the

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
 service is good.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,840
 Have you guys ever been to Long John Silver's?

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
 It's a fast food.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,360
 We didn't have a soda before.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,720
 Because there is a conspiracy theory that Long John Silver is connected to the marijuana

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,480
 - allegedly is connected to the marijuana industry.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,600
 There was this drug dealer who was trying to launder a bunch of drug money and he knew

37
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,200
 the guy who started Long John Silver, so he said, "I'll give you this money.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,200
 You can somehow convince people to eat fast food that is fish and I'm gonna launder this

39
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 money.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,680
 I'll see if I actually did that or if I just had a dream."

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
 It is a real conspiracy theory.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,440
 I'm pretty sure I did that episode.

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
 Long John Silver's though.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,560
 Why are we talking about Long John Silver's?

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,960
 Okay, let's get to the Arby's thing.

46
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
 I'm not living in Long John Silver's.

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 I don't need to go into their bell ringing technique.

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
 It's if the service is good during the bell.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,680
 Anyways, has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,240
 Apparently I'm just very hungry.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,440
 In Missouri, in the city of Lee's Summit, we actually have the exact address for this

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
 place.

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,160
 So if you want to go to this Arby's and take photographs and send them back to me, if you

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,600
 want to relive this event, you can.

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
 I don't recommend it.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,120
 On Highway 291 and Northeast Tudor Road, this story begins.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,680
 This fable of a young man begins in June of 2019.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,160
 There's a Arby's worker named Tanner Maggard.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,520
 And Tanner, he's 19 years old and he's like, "Oh, my first job."

60
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,880
 And he walks into the Arby's and he's making roast beef sandwiches and he's like, "Preparing

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,680
 french fries or whatever other food they have on your rings, I don't remember."

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,400
 Because I haven't eaten there in like 20 years.

63
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
 He's making all this food and he's like, "You know what?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
 I really love working here.

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,560
 I don't just love the disgusting food.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
 I like the disgusting atmosphere."

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
 He looks over at all the customers.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,400
 They're all like sloth people.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 He's like, "Yeah, this is the place I've always wanted to be.

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
 I've always wanted to work at an Arby's."

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
 He's this poor guy.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 Trust me, trust me.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
 You're not going to feel sorry for this guy in a little bit.

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,760
 The fact that he's working at Arby's is really the high point of his life.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,400
 Tanner is working at Arby's, but he doesn't work there very long.

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,840
 Because management has an issue with Tanner.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,480
 Sure, he might show up on time.

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,600
 Sure, he might prepare the food correctly.

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,720
 Sure, he might have service with a smile.

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,960
 He also has a bad habit of setting fires in the kitchen.

81
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
 Not where it's supposed to be.

82
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,760
 He's not like lighting pilot lights or cooking food.

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,360
 Apparently, I don't know if he did this on his breaks.

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,560
 They're like, "If you're going to do this, at least wait until your lunch hour, Tanner."

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,080
 Or if he was doing it on the clock, but he kept setting fire to the kitchen.

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
 And for whatever reason, there's a question.

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,760
 How many fires would one of your employees have to start at your place of business before

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
 you fired him?

89
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,000
 I think the answer would be one.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,200
 He set several fires during his time at Arby's.

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,560
 He kept setting stuff on fire.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,200
 And after, I don't know, the eighth one, they're like, "Oh, we've talked about this seven times

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,320
 before.

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,880
 You can't set stuff on fire in the store.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 You're fired."

96
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,040
 They didn't even mean the pun.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
 They didn't mean the pun.

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,880
 He's like, "Oh, no!"

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,640
 So he's fired and he leaves.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:14,560
 But then, on October 19th, 2019, it's been four months since he's been unjustly fired

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,800
 for trying to burn down in Arby's.

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,080
 He comes back into the Arby's.

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,520
 Now, I'm sure he stopped by several times between June and October.

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,720
 They didn't seem super alarmed when we walked back in, but they knew he was a weirdo.

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
 They knew this guy was a weirdo.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,600
 One, he worked at Arby's right and they all know there's something wrong with you if you

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 worked there.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
 But two, he was set up on fire.

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,440
 But you know, sometimes you gotta eat where you gotta eat.

110
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,920
 So he comes into the Arby's on October 19th and he places an order and then he goes to

111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
 the bathroom, which is usually the opposite order.

112
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,840
 Right, normally you eat Arby's and then have explosive diarrhea.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,000
 But before he even gets the food, he places the order and he goes into the bathroom.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,400
 Then a short time later, he comes out and he tells the manager, "Oh, I see you remodeled

115
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 the bathroom."

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 Huh.

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,920
 And then he gets his food and he sits down.

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,320
 The manager's like, "Oh, man, this guy's so weird.

119
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,040
 We didn't remodel the bathroom.

120
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
 Why would he say something like that?

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,160
 I'm too busy."

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,440
 Basically after this exchange, Tanner goes back into the bathroom and the manager has

123
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,480
 to go into the bathroom to clean it.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,200
 It's not for their monthly cleaning at the Arby's restaurant.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,800
 He goes into the bathroom and he's cleaning up the bathroom.

126
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,920
 But Tanner is in a stall and when the manager's in there and he's like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum."

127
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,120
 He's like picking up toilet paper or like wiping down the urinal, whatever.

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,840
 He hears Tanner in the bathroom stall going, "Ugh."

129
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,960
 He hears some gagging and retching.

130
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,720
 He's like, "Oh, man, this place is hard enough to work.

131
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
 It's hard enough to work here.

132
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,200
 Now I got this dude, this ex-employee, gagging in the stall."

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,240
 So the manager just trying to, I feel so bad for this manager.

134
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,760
 He's just trying to do his job, man.

135
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,920
 He's just trying to clean this up.

136
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 So he leaves.

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,560
 Obviously, he needs to clean the whole bathroom.

138
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 Tanner's in part of it.

139
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
 He's in the stall.

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,400
 You don't necessarily want to ask, "Are you okay in there, buddy?"

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,160
 The manager leaves the bathroom and then waits for Tanner to leave so he can finish cleaning

142
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
 up.

143
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,440
 Tanner ends up leaving the bathroom and the manager's like, "Oh, finally."

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,720
 And he goes in and he opens the stall where Tanner had been previously.

145
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,920
 And what he finds is, you know, so in a lot of restrooms, they have the baby changing

146
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
 stations.

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
 I actually think it might be required by law.

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,000
 I'm not for sure, but they have those plastic things that come down so you can put, because

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,080
 there's nothing you want to put your baby on than a piece of plastic that who knows

150
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,120
 if it'll hold the weight of your baby in an Arby's bathroom.

151
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:57,280
 You have the baby changing station on the baby changing station in the stall is a headless

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,880
 cat.

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,280
 And that would be troubling enough, right, if you walked into a bathroom and there was

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
 a cat with no head.

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
 Not only did the cat have no-- [laughs]

156
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,120
 I'll call the girl pause to give you guys time to skip ahead.

157
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,720
 Not only did the cat have no head, it was disemboweled.

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,880
 It was completely mutilated.

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,400
 And all over the walls of the bathroom stall and all over the toilet and all over the door

160
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,520
 was cat blood and cat intestines.

161
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
 And you know, it didn't have a head.

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
 The head was there, apparently.

163
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
 They didn't say where it was.

164
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,560
 I don't know if it was like propped up somewhere, if it was just rolling around on the ground.

165
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,680
 The manager's all playing hacky sack with the cat head until the police show up, because

166
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
 that's what he did, obviously, this guy called the cops.

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
 Disgusting.

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,680
 And when the manager came out of the bathroom, he saw Tanner sitting in his truck in the parking

169
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,040
 lot watching the manager, like he wanted to see what the manager's reaction was.

170
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
 And then when Tanner saw him playing hacky sack with the cat head, he's like, "Oh, why

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,200
 didn't I think of that?"

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 Tanner drove away, right when he saw the manager, right when they locked eyes, he drove away.

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
 Now, obviously, you guys might not know this.

174
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,520
 You guys might have never hired anybody.

175
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,400
 But generally, when you get a job, you have to list your home address, your phone number,

176
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,680
 your social security number, all that stuff.

177
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,200
 So the manager just called the cops and said, "Hey, I'm a little alarmed here.

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,400
 A man just eviscerated a cat in our bathroom.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,480
 And he's a known pyromaniac."

180
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,760
 And the police said the cat didn't smell.

181
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,960
 I didn't know this was a thing.

182
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,200
 I thought, like, if you cut something open to my remaining zero listeners for this segment,

183
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,080
 I thought if you cut something open, it would be stinky, right?

184
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,120
 But apparently not.

185
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
 Apparently if you kill...

186
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,720
 Okay, I should just stop now.

187
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,800
 But apparently if it's a fresh kill, it's less stinky.

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
 It's not super stinky.

189
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,920
 The reason why this is important, because if he had found a dead cat that had been, like,

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,520
 roadkill for a while, they would have smelled it and they would have been like, "Oh, he

191
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,280
 just picked a cat up off the road."

192
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,840
 Like, he found a previously dead cat and did this.

193
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,440
 The police go, "There's no rotten smell to this cat.

194
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,360
 That means he just killed it."

195
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
 He probably brought a live cat into the Arby's Restaurant and killed it there.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,960
 Tanner was charged with second-degree animal abuse, which really makes me think, "What's

197
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
 first-degree?"

198
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,640
 Like, if killing a cat, if bringing a cat into an Arby's, in and of itself, is an animal

199
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,880
 abuse, killing a cat in a bathroom stall, that's second-degree.

200
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
 What's first-degree?

201
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,360
 Like, what could you possibly do that's worse than this?

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
 Don't tell me.

203
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,120
 Don't send me images or anything or links.

204
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
 I'm just wondering.

205
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,760
 And he also got charged with property damage because he messed up their bathroom stall.

206
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,360
 They had to repaint it and everything.

207
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,600
 Now, you can go, like I said, I gave you the address.

208
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
 You can go check this out.

209
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,440
 I want some of my intrepid listeners to road trip out there and see if they can detect

210
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,640
 the blood, bring some aluminum.

211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,880
 I find it so fascinating, though, that how does a person like this even have a job in

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 the first place?

213
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,520
 Like, how does a person like this have the wherewithal to fill out forms and put down

214
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
 their social security number?

215
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,920
 Because obviously, he's setting stuff on fire and he's killing cats.

216
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,880
 Like, this wasn't his first rodeo, right?

217
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,040
 It couldn't have been.

218
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,840
 I can't imagine someone sitting there one day and be like, oh, man, I really hate that

219
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,560
 I got fired four months ago.

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,880
 I know what I'm going to do.

221
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,920
 I'm going to kill a cat and da da da da da.

222
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,320
 He had to have been doing this before.

223
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,680
 Doesn't it seem like there would be a ramp up to this?

224
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,880
 Or am I wrong?

225
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,720
 Are people just that easy to just push?

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,640
 That easy to just kind of push to the edge?

227
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,120
 It's funny because just maybe 10 minutes before recording the segment, I was on the

228
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,440
 Patreon Discord.

229
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,120
 They get to listen to these episodes live.

230
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
 And me and a long time listener of the show, Rudy Jazz, we're just talking about the story

231
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,000
 of Ian Watkins, lead singer of the Lost Prophets.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,480
 This is going to get real dark real quick.

233
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 I didn't plan on this.

234
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,160
 This literally happened 10 minutes ago, but me and Rudy Jazz were talking about Ian Watkins.

235
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,720
 He was a singer of the Lost Prophets.

236
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,480
 It was like this new metal band or emo metal band, whatever.

237
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 They're really big.

238
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
 They're really big.

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,600
 And apparently he started having sex with babies at some point during his career.

240
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,760
 And the question is, was he always attracted to babies?

241
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,640
 Or did he become attracted to babies while he was on tour with the Lost Prophets?

242
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,920
 The rest of the band had no idea this was going on.

243
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,560
 They had no idea at all.

244
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,840
 They were totally flabbergasted when the cops pulled out their lead singer and they're like,

245
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
 "What's he being charged for doing meth?"

246
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
 Because he also did a bunch of meth.

247
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
 He was also a meth head.

248
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
 "What's he being charged for?

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 You pig.

250
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Why are you arresting the lead singer of our band?

251
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 What is this?

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
 Some sort of police state?"

253
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,200
 And then the cops turned around and they're like, "Dude, we don't even want to see what

254
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 he's doing out loud.

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 It's so disgusting.

256
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
 Just trust us.

257
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
 Here's the arrest warrant."

258
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,520
 And the rest of the band was like, "Oh my God, that guy's disgusting.

259
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,600
 Can we go to the police station and beat him up for you?"

260
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,680
 Like what happened?

261
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,960
 Was he always attracted to babies or did he become attracted to babies?

262
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
 Now the meth didn't help.

263
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,960
 He might have been a totally normal person.

264
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
 Meth is satanic.

265
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,360
 Like the stuff that you go through when you're on meth is just so insane.

266
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
 Who knows?

267
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,120
 So maybe Tanner Maggard was just a normal dude who one day started setting stuff on fire.

268
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,280
 See that doesn't track at all.

269
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,680
 Most normal people just don't start setting stuff on fire and killing cats.

270
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,440
 At what point did he become a psycho?

271
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,920
 It's so fascinating.

272
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
 Maybe it was something inside of him.

273
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,960
 Maybe making one too many cheddar roast beef sandwiches drove him insane.

274
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,040
 Who knows?

275
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
 But I don't think this is the first cat he killed.

276
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,200
 There's no other information on him.

277
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,960
 I found this article and then he was charged with second degree animal abuse, second degree

278
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
 property damage.

279
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
 I couldn't find the results of the trial.

280
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,760
 A lot of stuff that's happened, like if you were arrested in October of 2019, what was

281
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,000
 it five months later the entire country shut down due to the pandemic?

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,560
 So he's probably still facing these charges.

283
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
 Maybe they've dropped him by now.

284
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,400
 Maybe he's still wandering the streets of Lee's Summit looking for cats.

285
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,080
 I should also say allegedly because he hasn't been found guilty.

286
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 He actually denied that he did all this stuff and then I compared him to Ian Watkins, one

287
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,280
 of the grossest people.

288
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,840
 So Tanner, if you didn't do this, I apologize, but if you did do this, you're sick, allegedly.

289
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,920
 Hammer, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

290
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,760
 We are leaving behind this Arby's.

291
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,280
 We are headed all the way out to Mexico.

292
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,120
 The cats are running the helicopter.

293
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,000
 They're like, "Save us, save us."

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,400
 We're catching all the kittens that we can as Tanner's chasing them down the street.

295
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,560
 Allegedly, we're flying out to Mexico.

296
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
 I found this story the other day.

297
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
 This is awesome.

298
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,640
 This story is really cool because we hear a lot of stories about UFO crashes.

299
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,360
 They're actually not super common, but obviously they're the big ones like Roswell.

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,620
 We hear these stories about UFO crashes.

301
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,360
 We hear these stories about retrievals like they went and they got the UFO and then they

302
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 put it on a flatbed truck.

303
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
 But I've never come across a story that is so detailed.

304
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,280
 This is almost a blow-by-blow account of what would happen if a UFO fell from the sky.

305
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,120
 I got most of my information from a website called Mexico Unexplained.

306
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,800
 What it sounds like, it's a paranormal UFO website that specializes in stuff that happens

307
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,040
 in Mexico and there's a ton of it going on down there.

308
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,080
 This article was written by Robert Bitto.

309
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,720
 Want to give him a shout out.

310
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,360
 Great, great story.

311
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,720
 He got it.

312
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,240
 The setup for the story was there was a UFO investigator.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,400
 I believe she's still alive.

314
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,880
 There's a UFO investigator named Elaine Douglas and she got an anonymous letter, well there's

315
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,960
 initials to it, JS, claiming to be part of something called the Deneb team, which is

316
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,320
 a retrieval unit.

317
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,600
 And so that's the setup for the story.

318
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,640
 There's been like a very famous book written about this incident, but it's flowing under

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,600
 the radar, no pun intended.

320
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,280
 I thank four people in America.

321
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,560
 I had never heard this before.

322
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,160
 I don't know how famous it is overall, but it seems to be pretty rare.

323
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,760
 It's not like a well known story.

324
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,040
 However, there is actually a cover story for this as well.

325
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,080
 It's popular enough that the government kind of had to issue a statement about it, but

326
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,480
 very, very fascinating.

327
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,840
 Let's get into this.

328
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 It's August 25th, 1974, 10 p.m.

329
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:01,840
 And at a U.S. air defense base, all of a sudden something pops up on their monitors.

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,600
 Sir, sir, come over here.

331
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 Look at this monitor.

332
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 Look at this.

333
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 He's pointing at it.

334
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
 He's like, "Get your finger out of the way.

335
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
 I want to see what you're pointing at."

336
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,680
 An object is flying over the Gulf of Mexico.

337
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,720
 It's going to enter U.S. airspace in about an hour.

338
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,440
 It's moving at 2,500 miles per hour and it's 75,000 feet up.

339
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,720
 Well, it's probably a meteor, right?

340
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,520
 It's probably something that high up traveling that fast.

341
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 It's probably something...

342
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
 It's a shooting star.

343
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
 Make a wish, young man.

344
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 Make a wish.

345
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,200
 Person who should be watching this machine, maybe it'll come true.

346
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,920
 But what happens is this object begins to slow down and then turn.

347
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,040
 It's still headed towards the U.S., but now it's coming at a different angle.

348
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,640
 And apparently multiple people were tracking this in the United States and at first they

349
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,800
 both thought it could be a meteor, but meteors tend not to slow down and turn.

350
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:11,200
 It ends up dropping as low as 25,000 feet.

351
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 We lost it, sir.

352
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,400
 It dropped off radar and the commander goes, "Hmm, very, very interesting."

353
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 And he walks away.

354
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 He's like, "Oh man, my wish isn't going to come true now."

355
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,160
 That's a real tear drop.

356
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,480
 About an hour later, radio chatter starts to pop up over the airwaves.

357
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,600
 A Cessna, a private plane leaving El Paso, Texas headed towards Mexico City, crashed

358
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,640
 in the desert.

359
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,960
 Somewhere in the state of Chihuahua, near a town known as Koyami, the Cessna went down.

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,320
 That was the last place they picked it up.

361
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,760
 August 26th.

362
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,040
 It's early morning now.

363
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,360
 It's like between midnight and 1am.

364
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,600
 Mexican authorities start to try to find this Cessna that crashed.

365
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,840
 Now here's the thing.

366
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,040
 Where it was at is where it should not have been.

367
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,840
 They have very strict airlines in Mexico and I'm sure they have them all over the world.

368
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,520
 And if you deviate from that, and this plane was like 40 miles off of one of these air

369
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,400
 traffic lanes, it seems like you're smuggling drugs.

370
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,680
 But even if it's not a drug smuggling plane, you want to see if there's any survivors.

371
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,200
 So the Mexican authorities send out rescue teams, air rescue teams, first to spot the

372
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,440
 wreckage to see if they can find this plane.

373
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,000
 The Mexican government has no idea that the US government was tracking an incoming object

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,760
 flying incredibly fast through the night sky.

375
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
 They do not have access to that information.

376
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,940
 So they send up their air rescue teams and as these planes are flying around looking for

377
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,200
 this fallen Cessna, they do spot it.

378
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,240
 At 10.30 in the morning, it takes them a long time to catch this, but because it's in the

379
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,760
 middle of the desert, they see the smoldering wreckage of this small private plane and they

380
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
 call it in.

381
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
 The rescue team says, "Hey, we found the plane.

382
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,760
 Send in ground units.

383
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,200
 Maybe there's still some people alive."

384
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,760
 But as this air recovery vehicle is still flying overhead, checking out the area, it

385
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,960
 spots something else.

386
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:22,140
 What they see is a silver disk that is crashed into the ground.

387
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,500
 And from what they can tell, it doesn't seem to be damaged.

388
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,100
 I mean, they are kind of up in the air, but it's not in pieces.

389
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,760
 Not like the Cessna was.

390
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:36,060
 They see this disk, it was about 16 feet in diameter, all in one piece, that it clearly

391
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,240
 crashed into the Mexican soil.

392
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,740
 So they call that in too.

393
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,040
 They say, "Hey, we don't know what this is, but it looks like something else crashed out

394
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 here."

395
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,500
 Maybe it collided into the Cessna.

396
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,960
 Now like every good conspiracy theorist know, the CIA has big ears.

397
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,560
 They're constantly listening in and they hear this.

398
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:07,400
 At Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas, the word comes in that while the Mexican authorities

399
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,320
 were looking for a plane that crashed, most likely a drug running plane, right?

400
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,100
 The CIA is like, "Oh no, our drugs!

401
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
 I mean, they're drugs!

402
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,620
 We have nothing to do with it!"

403
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,700
 As the CIA are now wondering about how they're going to get more cocaine in the United States,

404
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,140
 they hear this call come over.

405
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,540
 They hear this call come over saying, "Hey, we saw this disk in the desert.

406
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,980
 We don't know what it is, but when the rescue teams come out to check on the Cessna, maybe

407
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,180
 we should send some people to the disk as well."

408
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,780
 And the government of Mexico agreed to that.

409
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,620
 They said, "Yeah, we'll send out military."

410
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,760
 Because obviously this story is taking place in 1974.

411
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,480
 People knew what a UFO was.

412
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,120
 So they sent a military detachment to look at this disk, but even if it's not a UFO,

413
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,800
 could be some sort of government spy craft, right?

414
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
 So they do send the military out there.

415
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,120
 They send rescue crews to the Cessna.

416
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,800
 The CIA is intercepting all these transmissions.

417
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,200
 They know for sure that the previous night something was coming in through the night

418
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,660
 sky over the Gulf of Mexico, traveling extremely fast at an extremely high altitude.

419
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,860
 Mexican government still has no access to that information.

420
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,780
 So they go, that's obviously a UFO.

421
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,260
 First off, we know it's not ours.

422
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,580
 We didn't have any spy planes there.

423
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,300
 It's possible that it is like a Russian spy plane, and if that's the case, we should go

424
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,960
 check it out, but it could also be a UFO.

425
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,780
 So they have all the information they need to go, except they don't have permission.

426
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,120
 The CIA apparently, at Fort Bliss, was getting everything ready to go.

427
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,680
 And the author, Robert Biddo, says it seems like the CIA had done this so many times that

428
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,440
 they knew exactly how many men they needed.

429
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 They had all their equipment.

430
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,560
 They had four helicopters, including a heavy lift super stallion copter that's used for

431
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 retrieval.

432
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 That's a real helicopter.

433
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,680
 It's always picking up UFOs.

434
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,240
 Sometimes it's just moving more mundane things.

435
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,440
 The CIA gets their recovery team together and they're loading up their helicopters,

436
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,900
 but they technically need permission.

437
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,260
 So the US government starts to coordinate with the Mexican government and saying, "Hey,

438
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,380
 we heard about that Cessna, that crash.

439
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,540
 We're so sorry.

440
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,980
 If you do have to find any drugs on that, that wasn't ours.

441
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,260
 That wasn't the CIA moving drugs into the United States.

442
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,980
 Would you like any help with the recovery effort?"

443
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,820
 And the Mexican authorities were like, "No, we're good.

444
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
 We're good.

445
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,980
 Because there's possibly a UFO out there, right?"

446
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,060
 Or the very least, some unknown spy craft.

447
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,700
 So they say, "No, we don't need your help.

448
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,440
 It's just a Cessna.

449
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
 We can do it ourselves."

450
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,640
 And the US government's like, "Yeah, but the Cessna might have stuff on it that you

451
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,360
 really aren't prepared for, right?"

452
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,120
 And the Mexican government's like, "We can take care of the Cessna because really they

453
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
 just both want the UFO."

454
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,440
 Mexican government says, "You can't come over here.

455
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 We got it taken care of."

456
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,840
 Now the CIA is known for a lot of things, but most known for sticking their nose in business

457
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,800
 that they don't belong in.

458
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,000
 They're being told, "Stay away."

459
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So the CIA goes, "You know what?

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,420
 We're just going to go over there anyways."

461
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,580
 Like, we were just being nice, asking for permission.

462
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,300
 They take those helicopters and they leave behind Fort Bliss.

463
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,740
 They cross the US-Mexican border.

464
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,220
 They are headed out to the desert.

465
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,260
 As they're flying out there, they're getting this info.

466
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,660
 They put a spy plane, because this isn't just the CIA at this point.

467
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,780
 Apparently, according to the story from JS, presidents involved in this, US militaries

468
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
 involved in this.

469
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,280
 They have a spy plane and they're monitoring everything that's happening in the area of

470
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
 this disk crash.

471
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,600
 Because the CIA knows exactly where it's at, because they overheard all of the coordinates,

472
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,280
 locations, stuff like that.

473
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,280
 And the spy plane says, "Okay, we've seen there's a bunch of military trucks have pulled up

474
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,760
 outside of this disk.

475
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,680
 They're actually loading it onto a flatbed."

476
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,960
 So the Mexican authorities now have possession of this disk.

477
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,760
 They've loaded it onto a flatbed and it's driving through the back roads.

478
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,500
 They're not taking it in through the middle of Mexico City.

479
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,980
 They're not having a parade or anything like that.

480
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,540
 They're taking it along the back roads, way on the outskirts.

481
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,660
 And the CIA is these helicopters are flying overhead.

482
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,500
 They keep intercepting this chatter.

483
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,220
 They're getting radio communiques from the convoy, from the Mexican truck convoy to the

484
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,860
 Mexican government saying, "Yeah, we have it.

485
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,620
 We're headed down these roads."

486
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,460
 The spy plane's overhead.

487
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,680
 And then the helicopters get word that the convoy has stopped.

488
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,080
 It stopped in the middle of the desert on this dusty back road.

489
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,520
 The convoy is no longer moving.

490
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,200
 And all the radio chatter has stopped as well.

491
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,520
 So these four helicopters are flying over the desert and they have no idea what happened.

492
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,940
 But they're about to find out.

493
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:55,420
 When the helicopters get there, sure enough, the convoy is completely stopped.

494
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,820
 And they notice the helicopter's land and they, again, were very prepared.

495
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,940
 This is why people think that they may have done this a few times before.

496
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,340
 When they get out of their helicopters, they're wearing biohazard suits.

497
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:18,440
 And they start walking up to the convoy and every single person in that convoy is dead.

498
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,520
 Now it doesn't say how many people there were in total.

499
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,040
 It does state, the article did state that some of them were dead in their cars, which

500
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,720
 would imply that some of them were not in their vehicles when they died.

501
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,720
 But what the CIA are now standing among is a mass casualty event.

502
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,140
 All of these soldiers are dead and that UFO was still lashed down to the back of this

503
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,020
 flatbed truck.

504
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,460
 So the CIA just take the UFO, they won't render any aid.

505
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,380
 They don't have time to investigate any of this stuff.

506
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,620
 They're not supposed to be here.

507
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,780
 They were explicitly told to stay away.

508
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,060
 We don't need your help.

509
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:03,920
 They bring in that Super Stallion and they actually take the UFO off of the flatbed.

510
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,740
 And then all four of these helicopters fly back over the US-Mexican border.

511
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,660
 And they take it to this remote location and at this point the CIA attach it to another

512
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,980
 flatbed truck.

513
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,760
 And then no one knows where it ended.

514
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
 That's pretty much the end of JS's story.

515
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,220
 He says it either went back to Fort Bliss.

516
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,380
 It was taken to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, which is considered to be the

517
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,140
 true home of a lot of reverse engineered UFO craft.

518
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,360
 Area 51, this is the conspiracy theory, Area 51 is the decoy.

519
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
 So it's an interesting thing.

520
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,560
 So according to this story it either ended up at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fort

521
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,880
 Bliss OR the Center for Disease Control.

522
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
 Because here's the story.

523
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,160
 We don't know if this story is true, right?

524
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,440
 And we'll get to what we do know is true.

525
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
 We don't know what killed all of these soldiers.

526
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,500
 One of the ideas is it was radiation leaking from the ship that killed them all.

527
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,620
 It's possible, right?

528
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,620
 You can die pretty quickly if there's enough energy being released.

529
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,020
 I don't know if they'll be able to even load it onto the flatbed.

530
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,900
 They're like, "Oh, why do I feel so weak?

531
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,500
 Why do my bones feel like they're made of paper?"

532
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,220
 As they're loading it up.

533
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,660
 Some people believe that an alien could have gotten loose or the occupants of the ship,

534
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,300
 maybe not just one, could have gotten loose and torn them to pieces.

535
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,080
 Another thing that's accepted the most from the story is that it might be some sort of

536
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,400
 disease leaking from it.

537
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,840
 Because we know that we do that when we come to other places, other countries even, or

538
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,760
 other planets are trying to prevent us from bringing diseases.

539
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,880
 That maybe these people got some sort of fast-acting disease that wiped them out.

540
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,160
 Which in that case you would want to take into the CDC where they could properly contain

541
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 it.

542
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
 You wouldn't want to take it back to Fort Bliss.

543
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,800
 That's where all these CIA agents are.

544
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,460
 You're like, "Oh, let's just put it in this warehouse and then we'll go eat a hoagie outside

545
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
 and then they're all dying."

546
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,980
 You would want to take it to somewhere where they could contain this.

547
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,140
 The question goes, what happened to the convoy?

548
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,340
 One theory is that the convoy was cleaned up.

549
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,140
 Basically, the Mexican authorities came out there.

550
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,580
 They saw everyone was dead, that their UFO was missing.

551
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,740
 They either just covered the whole thing up, disposed of the bodies, or they actually destroyed

552
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,980
 the convoy.

553
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,720
 They blew up the entire area because they didn't know what had caused it in the first

554
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
 play.

555
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,880
 At this point, they would have figured, they would have been like, "Oh, the UFO must have

556
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
 flowed away."

557
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,960
 At this point, they would have picked up that four helicopters went through their airspace.

558
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,800
 All their stuff on radar would have picked all this stuff up.

559
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,880
 They would have realized the CIA was part of it.

560
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,800
 But they have to take care of these bodies.

561
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,840
 Since they don't know what killed them and the CIA wouldn't be giving them that information,

562
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
 they destroyed everything that was out there.

563
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
 Completely obliterated it from the face of the earth.

564
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,560
 They just don't know.

565
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:59,220
 What we do know is, in 1974, on that date, August 25th, 1974, a Cessna did crash in Mexico

566
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,700
 in that area.

567
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,220
 That's 100% true.

568
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,740
 There's debate about whether or not it was a drug plane, or just a plane that was 40

569
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
 miles off course.

570
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,940
 It was joyriding through Mexico.

571
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,300
 It's interesting because that's a fact.

572
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,860
 That's a fact.

573
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,280
 And you can look it up like when I was doing research on this on Wikipedia, they were like,

574
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,160
 "Yeah, a lot of people say that a UFO crashed in 1974, but it was really just this drug

575
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,320
 plane that went down."

576
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,840
 So, you know, it was just that.

577
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 We don't know.

578
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 It was pretty brief.

579
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
 It was on the Wikipedia page.

580
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 It was like, "UFO..."

581
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 What was it?

582
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,320
 It was in the Wikipedia page UFO sightings in Mexico.

583
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,360
 And it was a fairly incomplete listing.

584
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,600
 We've covered more on this show than are in that Wikipedia entry.

585
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,980
 But they said, "Yeah, a lot of people think a UFO crashed, but it was really just a Cessna."

586
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,460
 That's a weird debunking?

587
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,100
 Because no one's denying that a Cessna went down.

588
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,540
 They're just saying that it crashed into this UFO.

589
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,860
 Something was going on and these two vehicles collided.

590
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,980
 But then Robert Biddo was actually looking deeper into this, and he goes, "What's weird

591
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,380
 is that it's agreed upon by the skeptics and the UFO community that a Cessna crashed in

592
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,380
 the desert?"

593
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,240
 That's not what's to debate.

594
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,160
 However, he goes, "I cannot find any name of someone who was piloting that plane."

595
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,120
 He goes, "Listen, when planes go down," he goes, "Yeah, it was back in the 1970s and

596
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
 stuff like that."

597
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,280
 But they would have the records when that plane left.

598
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,600
 That plane had to issue a flight plan.

599
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,080
 As we know, it was going from El Paso to Mexico City.

600
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,360
 He goes, "There is no record of that plane ever issuing a flight plan.

601
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,780
 There's no name of that pilot."

602
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,260
 So he goes, "It's weird because even the skeptics agree that a Cessna crashed in the

603
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,140
 desert, but I can't find anyone who ever flew this plane.

604
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:58,740
 I can't get any actual concrete evidence that a plane did crash in the desert."

605
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
 It's very, very weird.

606
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,660
 It almost seemed like the better thing for skeptics to do is just say, "The whole thing's

607
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
 made up.

608
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
 It's all made up.

609
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
 It never happened."

610
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,180
 The skeptics say, "Yeah, a plane crashed, but it wasn't a UFO and the UFO community

611
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,180
 goes, 'Well, the plane crashed and it was a UFO.'"

612
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,680
 And Robert Bitto goes, "What plane?

613
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,400
 Like I can't find any proof that this plane existed now.

614
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,040
 Even if it was a drug runner plane, you do have to issue a flight plan 2.a and then

615
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,040
 just fly to point b."

616
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,200
 Fascinating story.

617
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
 Fascinating story.

618
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,960
 It is most likely that the Cessna did crash out in the desert.

619
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,720
 What caused it to crash?

620
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
 Who knows?

621
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
 It would seem weird that a plane crashing, which it's not super common, but it's also

622
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,660
 not terribly rare, would spark such a UFO flap.

623
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,360
 But the reason why I really love this story is we get that moment by moment interaction

624
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,460
 between these governments over what would happen if a UFO actually crashed.

625
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,660
 If it crashed within your borders, you could completely cover it up, especially if it was

626
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,380
 in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,860
 But when you have to cross international lines to get this disk, because what is the

628
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
 disk?

629
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,920
 Again, 1974, UFOs were considered a joke among the populace, but the US government made

630
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,000
 a concentrated effort to make people who reported UFOs a joke.

631
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,080
 That's what they did.

632
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,280
 They got their fingers in the media, which the government's always controlled the media.

633
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,520
 And they said, "Just call a little green man and make these people look like kooks."

634
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,440
 But this is the type of stuff that would go on behind the scenes, people fighting for

635
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,200
 these artifacts.

636
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
 And then where did it end up?

637
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,620
 Did it release some sort of biological weapon?

638
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,180
 And it's in the CDC and they're trying to figure it out, trying to create a cure for

639
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,060
 it or trying to weaponize it?

640
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,940
 Was it reverse engineered?

641
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,260
 Did they take it apart?

642
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,780
 It was some sort of Russian spy craft?

643
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,420
 Who knows?

644
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,740
 And that's kind of the whole thing.

645
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,000
 Who knows?

646
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,940
 We will never know whether or not we have disclosure tomorrow and alien life is revealed.

647
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,920
 I still don't think we'll know about all these little operations over the years.

648
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,080
 I don't think they'll be like, "Oh yeah, and then we invaded Mexico to take this disk

649
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,240
 and this is what they found."

650
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,520
 I think when if disclosure ever does happen, it will be played forward.

651
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,800
 They'll never admit they lied to us all these years.

652
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,400
 They'll never admit to that.

653
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,080
 It's a fascinating story because it shows really what lengths the US government will

654
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,040
 go to control access to this information, access to this technology.

655
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 They invaded this country.

656
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,260
 I mean, it was just four helicopters, but let's call it what it is.

657
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,700
 They invaded this country to steal this disk.

658
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,300
 What would have happened if the Mexican soldiers, actually, I just thought about this, who's

659
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
 this thing?

660
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,460
 They didn't kill all the Mexican soldiers, right?

661
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,540
 And they just go, "Oh, when we got there, their bodies were already riddled with bullets."

662
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,620
 I mean, riddled with disease.

663
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,380
 And then we blew up the convoy to keep the disease from getting out.

664
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,940
 I didn't think about that being a suggestion because what would happen if the CIA of those

665
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:04,800
 helicopters came out and the troops were still alive moving this convoy through?

666
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
 They would have taken it.

667
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,720
 They 100% would have taken that disk.

668
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,600
 And it goes to show the lengths that the US government, I really figure any superpower

669
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,640
 would go to to contain this technology.

670
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,200
 Like if you knew that a vehicle of extra-trust your origin crashed in another country, you

671
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,080
 would send people in to retrieve it.

672
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,980
 And if those few people couldn't get it, you may actually invade that country in full,

673
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,780
 whip up some bizarre reason to go into that country, to restore democracy, and get what

674
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
 you need.

675
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,460
 And while you're there, you know, you can install a dictator and see how that works out.

676
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,020
 It doesn't work out well, but at what point would you say, "No, we'll let them have it."

677
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,100
 You could not let an other country on Earth have access to this type of technology.

678
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,400
 That is how it would work out.

679
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,120
 You can have all this talk about disclosure and Congress hearings and people giving these

680
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,160
 highfalutin speeches about how we need to know the truth.

681
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,280
 But the truth comes with bullets in blood.

682
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,020
 The truth comes from agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency taking these things from

683
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,280
 people.

684
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,260
 We may believe that in the end, having access to this high technology will bring humanity

685
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,080
 closer together, will unite us as one people as we explore the stars.

686
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:37,460
 We may believe in the Star Trek future of exploring the cosmos as one people.

687
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:45,140
 But the journey to get there is covered in gore.

688
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:51,340
 It's crafted by countries invading each other to steal this technology.

689
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:59,300
 By taking possible survivors from these crafts and interrogating them the only way we know

690
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
 how.

691
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:12,140
 We may all want a future where we journey together as one species and explore the universe.

692
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:34,540
 But that journey starts with dozens of dead bodies in a Mexican desert.

693
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:49,020
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

694
00:37:49,020 --> 00:38:07,900
 We'll see you in the next one.

695
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,480
 (upbeat music)
