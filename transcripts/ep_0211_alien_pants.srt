1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 An Oxford professor believes that aliens may be breeding with humans, and the world goes "eh".

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,560
 And then we take a look at the saga of the charred pants, a story from my past,

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,680
 blending both the creepy and the criminal, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,880
 What started off as a normal episode talking about two stories, one,

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,880
 are there alien hybrids on the planet? The other one, about charred pants,

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,920
 became a benedryl soaked rant, where I only got to cover the first story,

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,640
 and then just kind of petered out at the end. Hybrids, aliens, and what I don't like about them,

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
 is what we'll talk about today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:01,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot to cover,

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,760
 and I'm on quite a lot of Benedryl right now. I'm super sleepy, I'm recording it late,

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,640
 and I still have to edit it. So let's go ahead and get started before I pass out in front of my mic.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,160
 Now, the story's been going around that there is a professor, an Oxford professor,

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,520
 who is claiming that aliens are breeding with humans. And it's one of those stories that,

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,840
 once you start to look into it, it really isn't as clickbaity as the headlines would read. Shocked,

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,160
 I know, I know you guys are shocked by that, but this professor has a name that's Dr. Young H.

17
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,800
 Cheek, and he's a Korean instructor, not for Oxford itself, but Oxford has like a,

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,720
 and it's still technically Oxford, but it's a separate, kind of like a satellite school,

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,280
 I guess, would be a good term for it, for Oxford's Oriental Institute. Now, I was always told that

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 Oriental was actually a huge racial slur. You never call an Asian person Oriental. I was

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,080
 corrected of that fact when I was probably like 15, 16, my dad's like, don't say that,

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,800
 they actually find that very offensive. But so I'm actually, either my dad was wrong and I could use

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,600
 it, or this place is super racist, I don't know, maybe both. But anyway, so at Oxford's Oriental

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,360
 Institute, there's this doctor who, and he actually put this theory out before, I think it was like

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
 closer, it was a couple years ago, maybe close to 2012, and it didn't really generate any waves.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,360
 And he, so then, but recently he's done another interview, he wrote this book a while back called

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,880
 Alien Visitations and the End of Humanity. And this was what, this is really what it was saying.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,600
 It's again, that hippie-dippy alien nonsense that I absolutely can't stand. We'll get to that in a

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,280
 second, but there's four alien races. They're small. That's very descriptive, Professor. Thank you for

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,080
 that. There's tall and bold. I read multiple articles and I'm like, do they mean tall and bold?

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
 Because generally when you describe, if someone goes, so what did the, what did the alien look

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,720
 like? You're not like, well, he seemed a little cocky. Like, I mean, tall and bold is basically,

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,840
 you kind of have a crush on him. Oh, he's so dreamy, he's tall, dark and handsome. He's so bold,

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,960
 he can take charge. Professor, you have to give, how is that going to help me identify whether or

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,560
 not there's an alien hybrid walking around? All you've been giving me so far is small,

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,120
 which could be anyone. Gary Coleman, Webster, I'd have forgot that actor's name, any small person,

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,760
 all the munchkins, or just people who are generally small and not like have some sort of medical

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,360
 problem. Tall and bold. So that's basically Tony Robbins. The other four, he had, the other,

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,320
 sorry, the other two he has is, now again, these are four more descriptive. We had small and tall

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:55,040
 and bold. Now we have aliens with scales and snake eyes. So did the other two look like normal

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,520
 humans, just one shorter and one taller and he's kind of bold, like a Laurel and Hardy type of thing?

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,040
 Because those ones are kind of specific and really all he had to say was reptilian,

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,680
 because that's what he's describing. Alien, I'm getting these, I'm not paraphrasing.

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,560
 These phrases were in multiple articles. Aliens with scales and snake eyes, just say

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
 reptilian dude, don't be a contrarian, you're trying to save the human race. Don't confuse us.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,040
 I start just running around pushing every small person down. Anyone who's over six feet tall and

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,680
 has and is like an alpha male, they're getting, they're getting, they're getting alien smashed.

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,200
 I'm gonna think they're an alien. I'm calling Will Smith. And then insect like aliens. So

49
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,320
 that, those last two, if I saw a man in a bar who looked like a larva about to hatch and turn

50
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,680
 into a giant bug, I would go, that is an alien hybrid. See, that is a description, insect like

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,800
 aliens. I can find those and kill them in the real world. Tall and bold is how you describe a cigarette.

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,600
 Like this, but anyways, so these are his four races that are here now. And he says that actually,

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,920
 they may be standing right in front of you, but we can't see them because their eyes don't work

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,360
 that way. So it's kind of like this, he doesn't necessarily say it's a alien from outer space

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
 thing. It could be some sort of interdimensional thing. He says the insect ones rule all of them,

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,640
 conquered all of them. And, but this is this, so that, okay, fine, whatever. You've created four

57
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,760
 classes that if I ever want to do some cheesy role playing game, those are the four classes you get

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,480
 to choose from. Maybe a human player who's kind of like the baseline and then the insect is better

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,080
 at like, range the tax and he has the flying ability and then the reptilian dude is just like,

60
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,800
 can sit on a rock and control his own body temperature. Short guy can like squeeze through

61
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
 tight spaces and turn invisible like the halflings from the, and then the tall and bold guy is your

62
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,440
 traditional, he'd be an elf actually, dude. Oh my God, these are just the indeed classes. But anyway,

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,120
 so he has these four classes and you think, okay, that's cool, like whatever. There's aliens walking

64
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
 around us. What are they planning on doing? And this is where it gets into the lame stuff. He goes,

65
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,680
 they're breeding with us and you're like, oh, that's kind of cool, kind of sexy,

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,360
 banging a fly person. How would you have sex with an insect human? And how would you have babies?

67
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
 Would there be like a hundred little human babies pop out of a maggot sack? But anyways,

68
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
 they're here to interbreed. Okay, that's, that's compelling to help us change the environment.

69
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:41,360
 I hate that part of UFOology. I hate it honestly. I hate, there's two parts of UFOology that I

70
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,160
 just can't stand. One is the aliens are coming here to help control the environment. I think that

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,960
 is one of the dumbest things possible. I think if you look, what was that movie called, The Arrival?

72
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,200
 Actually had it more, if there's any truth to it, more close to the truth, where the aliens were

73
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,680
 purposely making, changing our atmosphere to terraform the planet to match theirs. So all the

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
 pollutants that were going in, it was this huge alien conspiracy, spoiler alert, for a 20 year old

75
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,640
 movie with Charlie Sheen, but it was, they were basically working at changing the atmosphere of

76
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,480
 the planet to make it more like theirs. That's far more realistic. Why an alien would care if

77
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,200
 bottlenose dolphins got soda can rings on their noses? It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make

78
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,520
 sense at all. And he tries to say, you know, well, because they live here too and they're

79
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,000
 flotpin' in and out of alternate realities, but then just go to an alternate reality where it's not

80
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
 so grody? Plus, they really should have started 200 years ago because if they have this advanced

81
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,040
 technology, they should have said, well, we got here, but we had to suffer through this phase of

82
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,120
 pollution. So in the 1800s, they should have said, hey guys, don't do coal. I read this really

83
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
 interesting Tales from the Crypt, I gotta keep this episode short, but I read this really episode

84
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,200
 Tales from the Crypt comic book back in the day. And what it was was that planes of the, like back

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 in the 1950s, planes kept crashing. And first there's a big plane crashing like 200 people die,

86
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,440
 and then there's another plane crashing 100 people die. And the comic story continues, we're

87
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,200
 saying that eventually people became too scared to fly because if you got on a plane, the chances

88
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,360
 of it mysteriously breaking down was too high. And then only the military flew, but their planes

89
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,640
 began crashing into cities. So eventually, and this was worldwide, the world made an agreement,

90
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,600
 no more airplanes will do everything by boat. And then 20 years after everyone stopped flying

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,720
 planes and the technology was an advanced and people weren't trained to be pilots, the aliens

92
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,440
 invaded. And that's, they were interfering, they were like shooting down radio waves hidden from

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,280
 behind the moon or whatever. It was, it was the 1950s comic book, but how they did it was technically

94
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,160
 stupid, but the idea was interesting, how they were interfering with little tiny mechanical devices

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,040
 on our planes, making them crash to make it ripe for their invasion. There'd be no air force for

96
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,800
 them to fight. That would make more sense to me than an alien coming out and putting a little like

97
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,400
 daisy in a pollution pipe and being like, we're here to bring peace and clean energy. Like that's

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,440
 so stupid. It doesn't make sense for an alien race to care how sparkling clear our water is,

99
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,400
 because technically if they're super advanced, they could bring a ship down, they can put up a

100
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,360
 purification system, they can build a desalination plant. It doesn't pass the smell test. And I hear

101
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,960
 constantly that aliens care about our environment. It's so stupid. The thing that really bugs me is

102
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,600
 the aliens, the spirituality and the aliens, they want to like help us achieve a spiritual thing too.

103
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,120
 I think all that's nonsense. We don't even know if aliens exist and we're already assigning motives

104
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,720
 to them. And you notice the motives are generally indicative of the person researching them.

105
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
 So a paranoid nut job believes that the aliens are abducting humans and feeding babies to

106
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,720
 reptilians and Antarctica. And then a new age person will be like, but they're here to like raise

107
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,120
 our level to the age of Aquarius and they're all in Mount Chaston, they wear these long white robes.

108
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,400
 And then this dude and a bunch of environmentalists are like, no, no, they're here to help us change

109
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,840
 our environment. This is the true problem our generation is facing. I want to see a hippie

110
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,640
 really digging into ufology and they have like all of these beads and necklaces and crystals in

111
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,560
 their outmountain chastah and they see a reptilian just tearing apart a dude just like eating his

112
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 guts down. He's like, this is why we're really here. And then he has to change his whole world of you.

113
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,000
 But they don't because really I think at the end they're just selling books. This dude knows

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
 that this hippie message of aliens are beneficial to our environment will sell with a particular group

115
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,560
 of people, people who are Oxford educated, college educated. While the other guy who writes the book

116
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,520
 about the reptilians, that was an episode we did a long time ago, reptilians stealing people from Idaho

117
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,160
 and raping and eating them in Antarctica. He knows his audience of people who are going to read that

118
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,280
 book, i.e. people who get all their information from the internet. So they're never going to cross

119
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,440
 over. I absolutely there may be alien hybrids, I don't know. There may be tall bold people who

120
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,840
 are actually aliens, I don't know. But until we actually confi- what's interesting is no one ever

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,520
 really assigns motives to anything else. No one says Bigfoot does X because of Y. Sometimes you'll

122
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,800
 talk about him being like close to nature or something like that. Which is kind of an old

123
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:48,400
 brainer because he lives in the woods, of course. But with most other things, like popular things,

124
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,120
 they're not really assigned motives. People don't assign motives to every ghost. I guess they assign

125
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,680
 motives to demons, but I just can't, I can't grab my head around how you go from there's unidentified

126
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,560
 flying objects in the sky. Therefore we need to start recycling our plastic bottles more or the

127
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,760
 aliens are going to be upset. I don't understand that leap of logic. I have an easier time understanding

128
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,720
 there's unidentified flying objects in the sky. People go missing, ergo the aliens are taking

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,760
 the people. I get that line of logic because we do have people missing all over the planet all the

130
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,280
 time. We don't find them unfortunately. It is most likely, most likely with the little asterisks

131
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,600
 I'm not for sure, but it's most likely natural causes are serial killings or people just getting

132
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,840
 lost in their bones or somewhere in the woods, which is technically a natural cause. But you know

133
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,880
 what I mean? Like I can see if there's UFO sightings in a particular area and then there are cows dying

134
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
 of heart attacks, but you think that they got mutilated by laser beams, whatever. That makes

135
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,600
 more sense. There's, I don't can't think of a time I've ever read a story there was UFO sighting

136
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 in the area and then the next day in Flint, Michigan you could drink the water coming out of the tap.

137
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,200
 So I don't understand how they go from bright lights in the sky all the way to smoky the bear

138
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,280
 is an alien. Like environment, they're pro environmental. I don't get that. The spiritual

139
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,040
 thing I can kind of get because you can say, well this is what the old people saw when they

140
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 look up and they saw angels and stuff like that. But even that it's super bizarre and you know what

141
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,280
 I mean like whenever I, when I read this I basically groaned out loud when I got to the

142
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,160
 part about environmentalism. Humans barely care about the environment. Why would people who aren't

143
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,400
 from here care about this environment? If you go to Mexico, you're most assuming you're not

144
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,720
 Mexico, if you go to Mexico, I'm sure you're probably more likely to litter than you are to

145
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,240
 litter in your hometown. If you're from Mexico and you come to Hood River, I'm sure you're more

146
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,320
 likely to litter in Hood River than you are in your hometown. You don't go to another country

147
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 and tell them to start recycling. Otherwise they're, well I guess some people do. I guess

148
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,840
 environmentalists do but oh dude I just realized something. What if all the aliens

149
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,240
 are like the same race and some of them are just like hardcore environmentalists so they're like

150
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,440
 that's their thing and then other ones are like complete psychopaths and that's their thing.

151
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,880
 Because think about it, if you put, if all of a sudden we started sending masses of people across

152
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,720
 the planet, let's look at it this way. When we loaded up the ships, let's say so, you have the

153
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,840
 Spanish Gallians, you know what I think so funny? Portugal used to be an empire. I don't know why

154
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,240
 I find that funny but I always chuckle to myself when I'm reading something about history and they

155
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,200
 mentioned Portugal. It just, just kind of, kind of fell off the map. So bizarre. I was reading

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,600
 something the other day and it said when Spain and Portugal were vying for control, I just,

157
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:58,320
 I just kind of chuckled and I'm like poor Portugal. Aw. I mean who remembers them? There's like two

158
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,400
 countries who speak Portuguese and Portugal's one of them. Poor guys. But anyways, so I'm sure

159
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,520
 they'll get back on top eventually right? So anyways, so when these empires were sending out

160
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,680
 their ships they would have loaded them full of tradesmen. No they wouldn't. They loaded them full

161
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:22,240
 of soldiers and missionaries and priests. And so depending on who you met first, really was how

162
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,800
 you assumed that that civilization was. If you happen to meet a conquistador, you're going to

163
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,280
 be like oh my god these dudes are super militant. They have awesome armor and they might be a god

164
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,360
 but they're pointing that giant hollow tube at me. But if you met a priest first, you'd be like oh,

165
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,120
 this guy is dressed in like brown robes and he has a little shave circle on his head because I

166
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,760
 assume they all look like Fryer Tuck. And there's a fox and a bear dancing next to him and he seems

167
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,560
 pretty chill. He keeps telling me that I'm worshiping the wrong dude and I'm pretty sure the guy I'm

168
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:02,080
 worshiping is right but this guy's not like putting a metal tube like and shooting bullets or whatever

169
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,080
 they're called through my body. And you know there could have been some environmentalists on there

170
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,000
 as well. They're out of that group of soldiers and missionaries. There could have been some people

171
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,560
 who really like nature and they're like don't step on that butterfly. That butterfly will inspire a

172
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,360
 poet a hundred years from now. Don't do it. So maybe that's what it is. Maybe that it isn't that all

173
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,080
 the aliens are pro environmentalists or all the aliens are super. I just realized man I think

174
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:35,760
 blew my own brain. Maybe it's not that all the aliens do have a exact goal. Maybe it's the alien

175
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,400
 you meet. Maybe it is just this one giant fleet and what their main purpose is we don't know. We

176
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,960
 know that the Spaniards their real main purpose to coming over was conquering and setting up outposts

177
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,040
 and stealing all the gold and doing all sorts of stuff and then you know convert some people along

178
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,000
 the way and maybe steady the culture and steady the sciences and stuff like that. Like pick berries

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,200
 and send them back to Spain and stuff like that. So wow maybe that's why we get all these different

180
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,840
 reasons for why aliens are here. Whether it's military and they're like hurting us or trying to

181
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,320
 enlighten us or just trying to make sure we recycle our milk jugs. I still think the environmental

182
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,360
 stuff is completely stupid and if I did meet and I said this in an earlier episode if I met an

183
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,200
 environmentalist alien I'm beating it up. I don't care. I don't care. I will fight an environmentalist

184
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,320
 alien any day. You can put me in a gladiator arena that's made out of recycled water bottles

185
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,760
 and I will just mash them one by one by one until they finally take me down which will probably

186
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,600
 not happen because they're lame. Send me out one of the war aliens. If I get abducted by an alien

187
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,880
 please let it be one who's like going to try to eat me rather than one that's going to like preach

188
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:03,600
 to me. I would rather be anally probed than be strapped down on a table 30,000 miles up in space

189
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,880
 being told about my lord and savior Glopgloop. That would I be like you just break out the

190
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,640
 anal probe. He's like I am man I'm not into that. That's Nornex over there. That crazy Nornex guy.

191
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,280
 You know I'm like dude if you say one more thing about whatever made up guy that I just mentioned

192
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,080
 to you I don't remember and the guy's like oh sacrilege. I'm like dude seriously just get the

193
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,120
 anal probe let's get it over let's get back on earth and then the anal probe of course is

194
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,480
 recycled so that makes it twice as awkward. Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be our
