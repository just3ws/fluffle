1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 A man gets trapped in Antarctica for an entire winter and makes a horrifying discovery.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to Italy to find a long dead culture that was based around one thing.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Fighting witches and saving humanity today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm a walking doll.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first topic.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Suit up guys.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 That says buttoning up our buttons.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Sounds suspiciously like getting inside of some sort of military vehicle.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Put on your parkas guys.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We are headed off to Antarctica.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Also put on like pants and stuff too.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Don't just wear a parka and think you're going to be totally protected.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We're headed off to Antarctica and we're headed off to Antarctica in the year 1911.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So it's even colder back then.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I remember on a long ago episode I said I imagine that everything was hotter during Bible times.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I don't know like scientific reason for that.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I just figured that things were hotter in the past.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And I also believe that things were colder in the past as well.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So a cold winter in 1911 would be colder than a cold winter today.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And a hot summer in 1911 would be even hotter.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I don't know why I think that.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But I do and you can't change my mind science.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It's 1911. It's a super super cold winter and it's in Antarctica.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We're in Camp Adair Antarctica.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 So we're walking with our snowshoes in our poles and we get in and knock on the door.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 They don't get many visitors at Camp Adair and they open it.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Spooky oily door, not oily door. Door needs to be oiled.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So we walk into Camp Adair and we drop our gear.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We meet Robert Falcon Scott. It's a pretty dope name.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 He's in charge of this expedition.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now he's not going to be joining us on this mission.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 He's doing something else for whatever reason.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Like he's in charge of the overall expedition but he's not at this camp at this time.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So we're like, he's like, "See ya."

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He's like taking off, grabs our gear.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 We're like, "No, no, we need to survive."

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And he goes off on his adventure.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 We are now stuck there with George Murray Levick.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Not as cool as a name.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But he's actually going to turn out to be a pretty intriguing guy.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He's sitting there with his spectacles on, writing in his notebook,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 "Big old nerd."

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 We could have hung out with the Falcon but instead we're sitting there with Levick.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 He's like, "A gentleman, I'm so glad you've joined us."

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Apparently he's from a hammer horror film.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 He's writing stuff down.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 He's like, "I've been checking out the penguins.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We've been doing a lot of penguin research here."

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Now this group was dedicated to like exploring parts of Antarctica.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's 1911 so there's a lot of it that's unexplored.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 There's still a lot of it unexplored today but especially back then.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Now Levick was actually also a, he's an explorer but he was also a surgeon.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 So that's cool.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I think that's why they brought him along.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And a zoologist which explains why he loves penguins so much.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And there's five other dudes there that don't really matter.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 There's us five other guys that I'm sure they matter to their families.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'm sure they're really good young men.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But for the sake of the story, I'm not even going to bother reading their names.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So it's us, Levick and five other dudes hanging out.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 And this winter gets so bad these dudes get stuck in their camp in Antarctica.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 They're trapped in Antarctica.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now while we're trapped there, Levick goes, "You know what?

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Since we can't, his voice changed.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 His voice is normal now.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You know what?

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Since we're trapped here, I'm going to just steady these penguins all day long."

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And we're like, "No, dude, you have to like cook food.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You have to help like get firewood."

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He's ignoring us.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 He has beaks.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He has penguin beaks plugged in his ears.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So he can't hear us.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 He's steadying them.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Up until 2012, his was the only close-up steady of penguins.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 You're like, "Jason, seriously?

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Is that what this segment's about?

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 A guy steadying penguins?"

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Well, hold on.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Hold on.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 You got to have faith in me, right?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So these guys are called Adelaide penguins.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 They're named after some dudes like X, Y for something like that.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Or maybe his current wife, I don't know.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It doesn't really matter.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 They're just called Adelaide penguins.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Why would you name something after your ex-wife?

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Why would you name like a beautiful bird after your ex-wife?

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I can imagine like naming some sort of moss or fungus after her.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But I want to be like, "Oh, look at these cute little guys.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I will name you, fill in the name of one of my many exes

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 that I'm not going to put so she can't see me."

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Anyways, he didn't name them.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He didn't know Adelaide.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Someone else named these Adelaide penguins.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And he was observing them up close.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And we're all trapped here for one year from 1911 to 1912.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 These explorers could not move off of this place they're at.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's called Inexpressible Island.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And it's just a collection of boulders.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's barely-- I mean, technically it's island, yes.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Because it's surrounded by water.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 But it's not like comfy like sand or like snow, like soft snow.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You can lay around it and make snow angels.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 It's just boulders.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Just tiny little boulders.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So we're trapped on this island and he's taking notes of penguins.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 We're doing our best to survive.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And we keep asking him, "Hey, hey, Levick, how's that note taking going?"

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You know, we did provide food and shelter for us today.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We at least want to hear a good story.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And he'd be like, "Uh, no, I'm not going to tell you what I saw today."

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 What?

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You spend all day long talking to penguins, hanging out, and you're not going to--

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He's like, "You don't want to know."

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Turn the lantern down, like goes out, and we just hear him in the darkness.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 "No, not again.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I don't want to see it again."

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I don't know.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Every time I close my eyes, I see the penguins.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 What?

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Now, we end up eventually leaving an inexpressible island.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 We all do.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 In 1912, we're able to be rescued.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And here is-- and here's a quote.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So after they were escaped-- back then, like Antarctic explorers and North Arctic explorers

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 were huge heroes of society.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 They were basically that era's equivalent of an astronaut.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 They were going someplace where man never thought we would go.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So there is a lot of work done about these guys.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And here's a quote from one of these books about Levick and his journeys and how they survived.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 They-- here's the quote.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 "They ate blubber, cooked with blubber, had blubber lamps, their clothes and gear were soaked with blubber."

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I'm just imagining the clumps.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I'm just imagining their clothes are just like packed full of whale blubber.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And they're like, "Hidey, hidey ho!

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I'm studying some penguins today."

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 They're walking through.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 They have to make the shelter super big for their giant fat suits of whale blubber.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 "Blubbery clothes are cold," this quote continues.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 "And theirs were soon so torn as to afford little protection against the wind.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And so stiff with blubber, they would stand up by themselves."

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And you know they were doing that.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You know, like, as they were slowly becoming delusional from the freezing cold and the isolation,

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 they were putting on puppet shows.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 They were just having their fat suits stand there in the darkness.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 They're all naked in the corner.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 They're like, "Look at how funny the suits look."

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And then they said that they'd have to use penguin skins as sandpaper to rub the clothes to kind of like help scrape too much.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Now, they weren't actually sticking the blubber inside of their clothes.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 They were like, coating their clothes in blubber, but then the blubber would get so stiff,

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 they'd have to scrape off the blubber.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And they would use knives, and sometimes they would just use penguin skins, apparently,

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 so they could bend their arms and legs again because their suits would freeze.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It'd be like if you were in a mech suit and you were in the middle of a battle and your power went out.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I guess it's absolutely the complete opposite of that.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 When you jump out of a mech suit to repair it, you don't instantly freeze to death.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So they would have to use penguin skins to try to scrape it off.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And then this is a great quote.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 This is a great quote.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 As we go on to say that, you know, "Inexpressible Island" is just a bunch of boulders.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 It's just a bunch of rocks and pebbles and boulders and rounded stones.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Imagine sleeping-- imagine living on rounded stones for a year.

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 This is-- this levite guy is quite witty.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 They asked him about "Inexpressible Island," and here's his quote.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 "The road to hell might be paved with good intentions,

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 but it seemed probable that hell itself would be paved something after the style of "Inexpressible Island."

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Burn Satan, burn literal, and that's a figurative burn.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 He gets rescued-- everyone gets rescued off "Inexpressible Island,"

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 and then he's sent to fight in World War I.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 So he's in the Navy in World War I, dodging U-boats, going on adventures.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 World War II rolls around.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 He's 65 years old, and he goes, "You know what? Let's do this."

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 They're not gonna let him go on the front lines, but they do--

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 it is very interesting, 'cause you know, you go where you're needed.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 He starts training people in guerrilla warfare,

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 and he's specifically training them in survival techniques.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Now, I imagine that he-- he's a 65-year-old man.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 They brought all these young dudes into this war room, and he's like, "Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I've survived the most hostile environment known to man, so I'm gonna help you."

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Let's say that you're trapped in the middle of nowhere.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Nazis all around you.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 First off, grab some blubber, and they're like, "Wait, what? We're fighting in North Africa."

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He's like, "Find it. If you want to survive, you'll find the blubber."

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 They're like, "That's not gonna work, sir."

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Find the blubber!

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 All of his techniques involve, first off, he's like, "You want to help the French resistance?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Get some beached whales? Crash him into Normandy."

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 That was the original plan for D-Day.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 They're all gonna sail up on giant whales.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But he actually was involved in a very popular urban legend for a long time, too.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 He was one of the guys who was part of this plan called Operation Tracer.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And it was to build a giant-- not giant, but I mean, big enough for a couple people--

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 an observation post in the Rock of Gibraltar.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And so if the Nazis ever took Gibraltar-- I can't really say that.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 We would have an observation post there.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It was basically-- remember that episode of Star Trek?

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 You're like, "No, right when I said that after you guys were like, 'I know I'm not gonna remember this.'"

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 There was an episode of Star Trek where Starfleet built a hidey hole in a rock overseeing a village

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 because they wanted to spy on a pre-warp civilization, and data was hanging out in there.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Or maybe he wasn't there yet.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Anyways, there was-- yeah, so there was a rock with a hidey hole in it

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 that was covered up by a holographic projector, and one day the holographic projector failed.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And the people looked up and they saw like-- it was just like a group of renaissance technology-level people,

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 and they look up one day and they see in this mountain overlooking their village

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 a high-tech room with a bunch of people in uniforms, and then it flashed back.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 The psych attributed to being a religious vision that he saw a vision of God, not the Mariah Carey song,

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 but that he started writing that song after he saw Starfleet,

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 and Starfleet had to basically go down and disguise himself as people

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 to convince them that that wasn't a religious thing, that it was just like the dude was going nuts or something like that.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 It was the same thing, but no Starfleet, no holograms.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Now, what's funny is that for decades, people-- locals believed that there was actually a hidey hole car

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 in the rock of Gibraltar, and others were like, "No, no, that's impossible. That never happened."

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And then, like in the late '90s, early '80s, it came forward that, yes, that was true.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 There is still a room there that was carved out that you can-- I think you can go visit it now.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 So weird is one of those local legends that turned out to be true.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So he was part of that plan, the whole place was just encased in blubber.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 In case the Nazis showed up, they would just-- whoa, slip and slide.

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I don't know if blubber is slippery or bouncy or both, but we should start using it to do McDonald Playhouse.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The segment's going on way too long.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 The point is, his stead-- this is the point of this whole story.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I just thought all that was interesting backstory.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 The Penguin research that he had done, he wrote out and he began writing it in Greek.

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Because he's like, "No one can ever know what I'm seeing these penguins doing."

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He's writing in Greek.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 He never wanted anyone to just stumble across it and go, "Well, golly! Good thing I took that Greek course,

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 because now I can read this horrible, horrible thing."

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 He wrote it so the common person could not read his findings.

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 When he originally came back, he showed it to other bird people.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Other than like, they're like, "Kah, kah, there's like a secret village in England."

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I think this guy was from England. I should have said that earlier.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 That's why he was always digging around the Rock of Gibraltar.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 He-- was he from England? Maybe he was from America.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It doesn't matter at this point in the story.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 He goes to his other bird people, people who steady birds, not literal bird people.

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And he says, "Let me show you." You know how to speak Greek, right?

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And the guy's like, "Oh yeah, totally. I'm a bird person."

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 They're reading the book and they're like, "Oh my God, and we're not going to publish this."

242
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And he's like, "That's what I thought.

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I just want to let you guys know that I was the first person to ever really steady these penguins up close in their life."

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 You are, and it's good that you are.

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 We are not going to publish this a hundred years past.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And it still hadn't been published.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But people are still kind of talking about it in the bird community.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It's a bird thing you wouldn't understand.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And this is-- now it's been published.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It's actually a book that's come out called "A Polar Affair."

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And this is what we've discovered in this book.

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Adelaide penguins are-- one of the first things he notices is that there's a lot of gay penguins.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And that's pretty common nowadays.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 You're like, "What? That was a long buildup to gay penguins?"

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I saw that on the news the other day, and that's not it.

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So he's noting that penguins are having sex with the same sex.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 He's like, "Oh, that's shocking in 1911. You don't have the news."

258
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Then he's like, "Okay, well, I'll put that down. I'm sure that'll get published. That'll be--"

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 He's like, "Oh, my-- wait, what's going on?" He has to pull out his binoculars.

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 These penguins often-- sorry about--

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So yesterday's story was about animal sex as well.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 This is not an ongoing theme.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It was just the way these guys kind of worked out.

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 He noticed that Adelaide penguins have a tendency towards gang rape.

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So penguins-- I don't have to explain what that is.

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Unfortunately, that's a common term.

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Penguins will tend to team up and take down a female.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Maybe a male doesn't specify.

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Just gang rape doesn't really matter what the genders involved are.

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Adelaide penguins are known to have sex with chicks, like baby penguins.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So you can understand the reason why this stuff has been covered up for 100 years,

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 but that's not even the worst.

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That's not even the worst. They prostitute each other.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 So let's say I'm a big buff penguin.

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Penguins get the best mates because they build the best houses, right?

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And I'd have this awesome house and I'd have this hot penguin babe,

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 and you don't have as awesome as a house, but you want to like bang my wife.

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You bring me pebbles so I can build a bigger house.

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So you come, you drop off a couple pebbles at my feet,

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 and then I will push my wife towards you and then you bang my wife.

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And I use your pebbles to make my house bigger to get more wives,

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 and then I prostitute them as well.

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And this is all like 1911.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 This guy is the most scandalous thing he'd probably seen at this point was a woman's calves.

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And he's watching these big old pimp penguin pimping out his wives.

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And he said sometimes the women after having sex would jump up,

287
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 the women penguins would jump up, grab the pebbles for themselves and run off.

288
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The other penguins would be chasing it.

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Which is something that unfortunately like happens in real life.

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Not unfortunate that prostitutes steal pimp money.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Unfortunate like the situation that exists at all.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I think it's fascinating because that seems like something that's so human.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Again, not the prostitutes stealing the money.

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Not just that detail.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The prostitution in general.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I always thought it would be something that was a human thing, but no.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Right now as you're listening to this story, there is a penguin being prostituted by her husband,

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 and she's eyeing those pebbles.

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 She's ready to bolt once it's over.

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And again, to make things worse, he also observed penguins having sex with dead penguins

301
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 up to a year after their death.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 So it's not like they didn't know the penguin was dead.

303
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Penguin, it's not like you're walking through a blizzard with your wife,

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and then she gets like frozen into a popsicle,

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 and you don't realize that, and then you're like, "Hmm."

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And then you start being in the popsicle.

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Your wife's been dead for a year.

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Like you are very well aware that this is not a living penguin.

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Now when I read that, I thought that's impossible.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 How do you have sex with something that's been dead for a year?

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But then I thought it's freezing quads.

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I'm so sorry for this episode, guys.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's so cold that the penguin's body would not dissolve or decay, right?

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It would just lay there, and so it would look,

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 "Okay, let me back up. That's not justifying penguin necrophilia at all.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'm not saying that.

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I'm saying that now I understand how it's physically possible,

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 because you couldn't have sex with a year old corpse in, like, Louisiana,

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 because there'd be nothing left. It'd be being in a skeleton."

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Okay, we're done. We're done. We're done.

321
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Anyways, that is the story of George Levick.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 You guys are all-- after you guys are done throwing up, you're like,

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "Thanks for telling us that story, Jason. Let's go ahead."

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I thought it was fascinating. You can read the book.

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 You're like, "I don't want to read that book."

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 The book, "A Polar Affair," is out.

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 I just think it's interesting that you have, first off, penguins look cuddly, too.

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 You have a study that was basically banned by science.

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 No one disputed whether or not it was true.

330
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 They just thought it was too scandalous for people to know about.

331
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If we had known about all this stuff back in 1912, 1913, if it had been published right away,

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 would our views of penguins be different?

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Would they have made movies like "Happy Feet" or "March of the Penguins"

334
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 or the penguins of Madagascar really make you think about all those dudes?

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I mean, are they-- March of the Penguins, was their prostitution going on right off a camera?

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Who was the guy who did the voice for that, Morgan Freeman?

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Well, if Morgan Freeman was involved, there probably was some prostitution involved.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 How much time do we have? We spent so much time talking about penguins.

341
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Let's see. We are leaving behind Antarctica.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 You're like, "Thank God."

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And then we-- Let's hop on the carbon helicopter.

344
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's been retrofitted to withstand cold weather.

345
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 We're jumping inside. We're saying goodbye to Levitt.

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 He's like, "No, save me, save me!"

347
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 A bunch of penguins as we're taking off.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 We see a bunch of penguins waddling towards him.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He's like, "No, no! Save me!"

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 We just see his hands sticking out of a pile of very strong penguins holding him down.

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Apparently, these penguins do attack humans. They hit him with their flippers.

352
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 We're going to 1966 Italy, Italia, University of Bologna.

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Change the name. Change the name.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I get it that it used to be like Bologna or Bologna, whatever.

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I'm sure it used to be like a really cool place.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But once it gets attributed to a lunch meat, just change your name.

357
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 If all of a sudden they came out with a lunch meat called America,

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I think eventually we would just have to change your name.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Bologna. That's ridiculous.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Anyways, University-- Could you imagine getting a decree from the University of Bologna?

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Like, it's dumb. It's just dumb.

362
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Right now there's a listener in Italy's tearing up his degrees.

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 He's like, "Oh, mechanical engineering. He's right.

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 I'm useless because I have a degree from a lunch meat."

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 University of Bologna.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 There's a do-name Carlo Ginsberg.

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He discovers these old trial transcripts.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 He's a historian.

369
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So he's digging around in the history wing of Nerd Central.

370
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And he discovers these trial transcripts from the 16th and 17th century.

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Which trials?

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And it's funny because other people were super jealous of him.

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 They said, "This is a once in a lifetime find. This is what historians love.

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 They're nerds and they love discovering stuff no one's ever heard about."

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He finds these old witch trials.

376
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And what he-- As he's going through those, what he keeps coming across is the term

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 "bin in daunty."

378
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 "Bin in daunty."

379
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Now, "bin in daunty" in modern times meant and means,

380
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 but for Carlo especially meant "witch."

381
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But as he's digging through this, he's making some pretty insane discoveries.

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "Bin in daunty"-- Yes, means "witch."

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Now.

384
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 But it used to refer to a subculture of people who were all witches.

385
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It would be the equivalent of if you found out, like, the term cut.

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So, people just kind of thought it was a slang term for a witch,

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 but it actually referred to a group of people that no longer existed.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So we started really, really digging into this.

389
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 So we're going-- As he's, like, looking through his books,

390
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 we're going to run and we're going to jump over his shoulder and we're going to,

391
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 "Ew, fly into the book.

392
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 It's a power we have now.

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 We're going back in time to the 16th century."

394
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 We land.

395
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I land in a big, soft comfy hay bale.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 You land in an empty hay cart.

397
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So we take it away.

398
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You use the cart, take it to the hospital, get your back repaired.

399
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And now we're both good.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 He said I could have planned it a little bit better.

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 There was another hay cart right next to that one, but hey, what do you want me to do?

402
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 We're now walking through 16th century Italy.

403
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And we're going to meet some of these Ben and Dottie people.

404
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They all have this little necklace with this little sack around their neck.

405
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 "Hey, what's in the-- What's in the sack? What's in the sack?"

406
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And they go, "Oh, it's my call."

407
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 See, Ben and Dottie were basically--

408
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 You could be born anywhere in northern Italy and become a Ben and Dottie,

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 but you had to be born with an emionic sack on your face.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It's called a "call."

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And so that means that you were able to go to the other side,

412
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 or you have these special powers.

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 It was super rare.

414
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I think it was like one in 80,000 births or something like that.

415
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And I don't know if people still get them.

416
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 But the way you're born is your ambiotic sack is born around your face,

417
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 and when you're born, they peel it off.

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Now, that's an old folktale thing.

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 That's popular all over Europe.

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 A lot of times people would buy these sacks from babies.

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Not the babies themselves.

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 They'd go to the mom and be like, "You got any sacks for me?"

423
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And the mom's like, "Do I have sacks for you?"

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then she opens up a thing, and it's all these jellyfish-type skins.

425
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And sailors would buy them, and lawyers would buy them,

426
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 and soldiers would buy them.

427
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It'd basically guarantee good luck.

428
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 In northeastern Italy, people who are born with them, they would save them.

429
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 They'd put them in a pouch around their neck.

430
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And around the time they were 20, someone would come up to them

431
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 with also a little pouch around their neck and say,

432
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 "Hey, you're one of them cowboys, right?"

433
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Yee-haw!

434
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And they're like, "Yes, I am."

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And they'd get recruited into becoming a benedotti.

436
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So imagine, you know, gypsy is like an ethnic group.

437
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It was kind of the same type of subculture, but it wasn't...

438
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I mean, I guess they were all Italian and was all kind of in a particular region,

439
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 but it wasn't a bloodline thing.

440
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 You just had to be born with a call on your face

441
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 and then recruited by another benedotti.

442
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And you were taught the powers of white witchery.

443
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Benedotti back then literally meant the good walkers.

444
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Because you had the witches and the warlocks who were destroying the country sign.

445
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 But you were born with this call on your face.

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You were born with a destiny.

447
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You've been recruited now to fight witches.

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 How do you fight witches?

449
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 This is interesting because yesterday we did a story about the theists of Cantalbrun,

450
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 who was the werewolf who would go down to hell,

451
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 bring barley back that was stolen to promise to get harvest.

452
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 That's exactly what these guys did.

453
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Now Theus was actually, I think, 100 years after the bulk of these stories.

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And he was in Germany. All this stuff is happening in Italy.

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But the two stories are kind of connected in the traditions being the same.

456
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 But the benedotti, it's four nights a year.

457
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 They were able to travel to hell and fight Satan and fight witches and bring back barley and grain.

458
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And stuff that had been stolen by the evil witches on earth.

459
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But when they weren't going to hell to doing this, there was a constant battle between the good witches and the bad witches.

460
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And what would happen was the male benedotti at night would fall asleep and they would turn into spirit animals.

461
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So they could turn into like a deer or a bird.

462
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Some of them turned into a butterfly. Great combat form. Jerk.

463
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 What are you going to do? How are you going to fight a witch as a butterfly?

464
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 You know the other benedotti were super mad when Jerry kept showing up as a pretty butterfly.

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 They're like, "Dude, get something with antlers or claws or something."

466
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 He's like, "No, I'm going to sneak into their fortress and I'm going to spy on them."

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 They're like, "Dude, this is the middle of the winter, in the middle of the night."

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 People are going to notice a super colorful butterfly flying around their evil castle.

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And when they weren't like they would turn into these magical monsters or animals, probably a better term,

470
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and they would go and they would attack witches.

471
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Or sometimes they would just run through town and beat up witches.

472
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Now the witches also were totally aware of this war and they knew each other.

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 So back in 1966 this dude is finding these trial transcripts detailing all this stuff.

474
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 He's like, "This is a huge part of Italian history. I mean it's not as huge as Rome,

475
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 but it's still like a part of something that was going on."

476
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Which I guess is the definition of all history, but he's like, "Nobody ever knew any of this except at the time."

477
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 So that was a weird segue. We're back in time.

478
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Now the benedotti knew who the evil witches were and the evil witches knew who the benedotti was.

479
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It was this hidden war that was going on.

480
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And they would just beat the crap out of each other.

481
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 They would use rods and they would beat each other in the middle of the streets

482
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and then someone would come along and be like, "Why are you guys fighting?"

483
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And they wouldn't say. They'd be like, "Uh, he is a jerk."

484
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And the other guy's like, "Well, I'm pretty sure that he turned into a butterfly

485
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and was spying on my wife taking a shower."

486
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I mean, he's a jerk too.

487
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So they were totally hiding this war, but people were getting beat up.

488
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It was the sharks and the jets, but with magical bat powers and butterflies.

489
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 So eventually though, you had this little thing going on at the time called the Inquisition

490
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 where there were hunting witches. That's what we were always told, right?

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 The Inquisition was about hunting witches and heretics.

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So people start going, there's the Roman Inquisitions going on in Italy

493
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 and people start going to the Inquisitors and they're like,

494
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 "Dude, you won't, but you want to find witches, right?"

495
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 There's a bunch of them up north, a bunch of them in northeast in Italy.

496
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 The Inquisitors go up there and they start interrogating these people

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 because they're wearing little sacks around their neck and they'd make folk remedies and stuff like that.

498
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 But they weren't telling people straight on that, "Yeah, I can turn into a butterfly in the middle of the night,"

499
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 but people kind of figured something was up.

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Inquisitors show up, begin interviewing these dudes, and they're like,

501
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 "So what's going on?" and they're like, "Okay, listen, yeah."

502
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 "Four nights a year, I can turn into a goat and I'll go down to hell

503
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and I'll poke Satan in the butt and sell a bunch of barley, bring it back up, save the harvest.

504
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 We do that."

505
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And then like during the rest of the year, we just kind of find witches in the streets

506
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 and just beat the tar out of them.

507
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And you know, we take a couple licks ourselves, but we're good guys.

508
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 We do practice witchery, but we're the good walkers.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And this is why I was born with this column of things.

510
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And the Inquisitors are kind of hearing all this stuff and they're like,

511
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 "This is the dumbest thing we've ever heard."

512
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So it's really weird.

513
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 The Roman Inquisition pretty much makes a decision to leave them alone.

514
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 They kept arresting them, they had to interrogate them and say,

515
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "This is stupid."

516
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And they'd let them go.

517
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I think a couple of them got tortured, but there was no like mass slaughter of these people.

518
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And it got to the point where the Roman Inquisition just, this is their thing.

519
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I don't know if this was the case throughout the whole period of Europe during the Inquisition,

520
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 but the Roman Inquisition, they wanted to find religious people who were heretics,

521
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Christians who were heretics who were using the pulpit or using pieces of Christianity

522
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 to pervert it as a whole, because that was a threat to their power structure.

523
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 These guys were not a threat, even though they were witches and they were practicing magic,

524
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 which is against the Bible.

525
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 They didn't see them as a political threat, so it wasn't worth their time.

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And it got to the point that people would come to the Inquisitors and go,

527
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "Hey, hey, there's some bin and doddies over there that are like flying around."

528
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Not literally, but pretending to fly around or they're throwing rods at people.

529
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And the person who reported them would get in trouble, because the Roman Inquisitors got so tired

530
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 because eventually there were so many reports of these guys, because they begin to come more and more open,

531
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 that the Roman Inquisitors would, they'd throw you in jail if you reported it just for wasting their time.

532
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 So why did the bin and doddy disappear?

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 If it wasn't because of the, your first thought is once the Roman Inquisitors showed up in the story,

534
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 "Oh, they just all got massacred."

535
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 That's not what happened.

536
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 They ended up falling apart the way almost every religion does.

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 It's a fascinating story of human history in a nutshell.

538
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Micro-history is actually the term.

539
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 You had the bin and doddy who were waging this hidden war against the evils of the world.

540
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And they began to become more public because they're being dragged to trial by the Roman Inquisitors,

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 but the investigation's eventually in, but the rumors of their abilities don't.

542
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 So they become more and more open and brazen about, "Oh, yeah, I'm a bin and doddy. It's no longer super secret."

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 "Yes, I fight for the good. I fight for you, dear villager, and you, and you, and you."

544
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And then a next generation pops up and they go, "How can we make money doing this?

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 How can we monetize this war of good against evil?"

546
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So they begin charging money for blessings and charms and cures,

547
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 which all it used to be free because it was part of the war, the war effort.

548
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Now they're charging money for it. "Oh, you need a good harvest? Well, I'm gonna need some of that scratch."

549
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 "I'm gonna need some of that good stuff to go to hell to get back some of that sweet, sweet barley you need,"

550
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 "that got stolen by those witches." And that goes on for a while.

551
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And then eventually people go, "Oh, these dudes are scam artists."

552
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And they alert the authorities and the authorities who don't care about the witching and the--

553
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I mean, they care about Satan and witchcraft and stuff like that, but they pretty much left these guys alone.

554
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 They think it's all just folktales. However, they do have laws on the books about stealing and fraud

555
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and ripping people off and all of this stuff. So then the investigators come in, they arrest the leadership.

556
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Before there wasn't even a power structure to the Ben and Donnie. It was just something that was there.

557
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 But once money got involved, you had a hierarchy set up.

558
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And the top leaders got arrested, people went to jail, people got sued,

559
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 or the equivalent back then of being sued had to give money back was this whole thing.

560
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And the culture just died out.

561
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 So it wasn't a dramatic battle of good versus evil. It wasn't all the Ben and Donnie went to hell

562
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 for one last major push against Satan. It was human greed that ended up destroying a culture

563
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 that may have actually been going to war with real-life witches.

564
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And they've been lost to history. If this young man hadn't found those historical trial records

565
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 before they rotted away or simply got misplaced in some library,

566
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 they would have completely disappeared to history.

567
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Ben and Donnie would have just been a term for a witch. Nobody really would have known where the term came from.

568
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 So that's the story of the Ben and Donnie.

569
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 A group of people born with unique abilities, who were recruited into a secret war,

570
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 who fought evil on the behalf of all humans, and then eventually became corrupt and evil themselves,

571
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 became the instrument of their own downfall, and disappeared from the history books.

572
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Did this group actually have magical powers? Did they travel to hell to fight Satan?

573
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's doubtful. But who knows?

574
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 If it was a harmless group of wackos and lunatics, they wouldn't have disappeared from human history.

575
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I think people would have held them up to go, "This is a cult. This is what happens when you follow a cult."

576
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 It's just another example of people having dumb superstitions.

577
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Let's not forget about them so we don't replicate their mistakes.

578
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 However, if there was truth to this story, the Dark Forces of the World wouldn't want people to know

579
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 that they were once fought toe-to-toe with a group of white witches.

580
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 They would rather you be afraid of all magic than to believe that some people can wield it against them and against their dark master.
