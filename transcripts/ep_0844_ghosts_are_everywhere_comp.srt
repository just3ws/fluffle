1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A mystical fox woman may have broken out of a rock in Japan.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Does that spell doom for the rest of the world?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then, there are many people who wish they had a paranormal experience.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Specifically, a lot of people wish they could see a ghost.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Well, maybe we do.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Every time we step outside. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm a walking doll.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I think it's the start of allergy season because my nose is running.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hopefully I can edit out all the little sniffles.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 But someone who never makes me sniffle walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 longtime supporter of the show, and our Thanksgiving live stream supporter for today.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Give it up for spiritual abortion.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Woohoo! Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command spiritual float on in like a little ghost.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Spiritual abortion. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Just helps for the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Spiritual? Let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We are going to glide all the way out to Japan.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [Distorted sound]

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I got this recommendation the other day from one of our, again, longtime supporters of the show,

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Ampus Allen. So thank you Ampus for sending this on over.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And the story's really gone...

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Okay. And the story's really gone viral.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I was about to talk about this ghost.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 The stuff's flying around in my apartment. I don't know if the microphone picked that up.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But as the story, let me get back on topic. This is a weird one.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 The story's gone viral. It's hit the mainstream media.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I heard about it on the export and this is what it is.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We are at Mount Nassu. That is in the Toki-Gi prefecture in Japan.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 There's been a prison break, but not one of the prison breaks that you have to be worried about

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 some dude in an orange jumpsuit jacking you while you're driving on the road.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Give me your car! Give me your wallet too! Give me everything you have!

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 No, not one of those prison breaks. That would be preferable.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 This is the prison break of a very, very well-known and very, very hard-to-defeat demon.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Well, demon might not be the right word.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 In Japan, it's known as a yokei, which is like a spirit. It's kind of like a devious spirit.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 The yokei or the yokai, it's a really interesting mythology they have over there.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I got a lot of requests to cover the yokai as a whole since the beginning of the show.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 The reason why I never have is there's basically two types of yokai.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 The ones that are from old legends and old fables and then they just made them.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 At some point, they started making them up and it's known that they made them up in the culture over there.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 In Japan, there's like this period of time where we made up all these really cool ones.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 A bunch of writers made them up and they get mixed in with the ones that are based on old legends.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I didn't want to basically just do the old timey version of the SCP foundation.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So once I realized that, a lot of times you can't tell which ones are totally made up and you're like,

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 "Jason, well, the Greek gods are technically made up. They don't exist."

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Yeah, but they're from old legends. People thought they existed.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They knew were versions and when I say knew or I'm talking like 1600s, the yokai are just...

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 They're like, "Oh, what if there's one that does this really, really, really cool thing?"

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But you know what I mean? There's a difference. There's the creepypasta.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Then there are the ones people actually fear.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 So we have this one we're going to look at and this one does seem to be far enough back that it seems to be one of the real ones.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And if this story has any truth to it, it's absolutely fascinating.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So there's been a prison break. There's this thing called the "Sesho Seki" or the "Killing Stone".

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And it was this giant rock sitting near Mount Nassu.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Now this area has a lot of sulfur springs and the story was that if you went near this rock, you would die.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It was putting out some sort of poison gas and this was the perfect holding spot for one of the world's worst villains.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And I want to give a shout out to Lily0727K. They're the ones who originally saw what had happened.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Saw that this rock is broken open and a warding rope that had been attached to it.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I don't know how the rope was attached if when you go near the rock you die from poison.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But anyway, someone with really, really long arms, someone who could hold their breath for a long time,

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 attached this rope with a warding spell, basically, a seal, and they trapped this creature in the rock.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But you're going, "Jason, which creature are we talking about?"

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 She's known as Tamamo No Mei. And it's a nine-tailed fox lady.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It appears that Tamamo No Mei has broken out of their prison.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They were put in this hundreds of years ago into this rock.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Tamamo No Mei, we probably aren't familiar with the name, but we may soon be bowing down to this creature.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 This is the Japanese name for this nine-tailed fox spirit.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But this is a creature who has devastated multiple countries in the ancient world.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 According to legend, this is a spirit that possesses concubines or wives or consorts close to,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 or at the right hand, of very, very powerful generals, kings, princes, things like that.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And basically, once she's in a position of power, when she possesses one of these women,

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 she then begins to use her influence. She has the king's ear to put forth evil policies.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 She's actually credited. It depends on whether or not you're a fan of the Shang Dynasty.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 She's either credited or blamed for the toppling of the Shang Dynasty in China.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Then she left that. She's like floating away as the whole civilization's falling apart.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 See you later, losers!

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 She then goes to India and has the ear of a prince in India and convinces him to cut the heads off of 1,000 men.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And she's like, "Kachow! That's exactly what I wanted. I'm out of here."

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 You figure the poor concubine as the spirit's leaving her, she's like, "Oh man, what was I up to the past nine months?"

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It's totally blacked out. And then she looks and there's 1,000 heads in front of her. She's like, "Whoa!"

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Then at this point people start to look out for this female character.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 They start to... the cultures in the countries are like, "Listen, if we ever see this woman,

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 because she's possessing... there's a woman walking up to the king being like, "Hey, baby."

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And she has nine tails coming out of her butthole.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 She's this... they're getting possessed. So how do you stop this?

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But now that two empires have had some serious problems with this thing,

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 they know kind of what the science looked for. It ends up making its way back to China.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And there it possessed the concubine of King Yu and was stymied, was actually not able to do any sort of evil there.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The military formed an army to chase her off.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Now I don't know if that means that she's like, "You'll never defeat my magic!"

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And she's like shooting beams and like military troops are getting blown away and they're like,

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 "More spears! Throw them at that thing!"

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And she's like putting up four shields and she's like, "My might is too strong!"

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Or... there was a concubine running through the desert and an entire army chasing her

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and she's like, "I don't know what's going on! I don't know what's going on!"

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And they're like, "Keep moving, men!"

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And you know, it just says that the army chased her off. I don't know if it was a cool magical battle

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 or if a one single concubine was chased through the forest by 10,000 troops.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 This goes on for a while, right?

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 She's kind of moving from culture to culture and we lose track of her after she gets chased out of China.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 We kind of lose track of her and I'm wondering if she moved to other cultures that weren't planning.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 They didn't know about this thing, right?

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 She moved to the Middle East or she moved to Western Europe or whatever.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 She could have done some damage and not have been recorded because they wouldn't have known the science to look for it.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 But anyways, she's not talking to one guy.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 She's like, "You know what will be great for Europe? A little thing called the Dark Ages!"

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And he's like, "That does sound like a good plan."

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Destroy the history books and then she's flown away.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Anyway, she goes back to the Asia region and she ends up in Japan

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 and the last form she takes is the form of this concubine, Tomomo Nome.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She's considered the most beautiful and smartest courtesan of Emperor Toba.

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And you could ask her any question.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 They'd be like, "Hey, what was the name of that horrible creature that's been floating around, killing a bunch of people?"

118
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And she's like, "Uh, you. You heard the name of the creature. Everyone attack her."

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And that person gets chased off of the military.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But this possessed woman could answer any question put before her.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And then the Emperor starts to fall ill.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And luckily, there are people close to him that have good memories.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And they're like, "Hmm, we know that there's this evil spirit that's been floating around the region."

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And maybe that's the reason why the Emperor is falling ill.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Maybe it's one of his concubines and it doesn't take him long to figure that it's probably the most beautiful

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and the one who knows everything, the one that has supernatural knowledge, might be possessed.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And once again, the spirit is chased out.

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Now that's the legend of Tomomo Nome.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And that was the name of the latest body that it had possessed, if I got this correctly.

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 The idea of her being put in the stone doesn't seem to be part of the original legend, honestly.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Like, I could be wrong, but looking through the stuff, that, I think, was added on by later Yohara.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Later Yohkai writers.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And that's the type of thing when I was like, because I was looking into this story and I thought,

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 "Oh, I don't know at what point the fix-- like the knowable fiction stuff comes in."

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But once Ampus Allen was like, "Hey, man, you want to do this?"

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He's always all breaking rocks. He's breaking rocks.

137
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And I was like, "Come on, demons, take over the world!"

138
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I stopped breaking rocks, bro. I've covered your story.

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I said, "I'll take another look at it."

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But so we have the actual ancient legend of this nine-tailed fox traveling around the region.

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And the part of it being trapped in the rock,

142
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 that's definitely part of the legend, but it might have been added on later,

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 by some fiction writer who wanted to give the story some ending.

144
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But whatever it is right now for hundreds of years, even the fictional stuff, right,

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 it's been around for hundreds of years,

146
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 it was supposedly in this stone with this warding band on it.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Like someone actually constructed all this stuff. It wasn't actually a band that just said "Caution, rock may crack."

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It was a warding thing for this fox, but that could, again, also just be creepypasta on top of it.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So it wouldn't surprise me that somebody added this band on there if they heard the story.

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But again, you'd think, if you go near the rock, it kills you.

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 That's part of the legend who put the warding band on it.

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Well, anyways, it's broken open.

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So local authority-- this is a historical place.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And so the local authorities and national authorities are meeting about this.

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Like what are we going to do? Are we going to put the rock back together?

156
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 You know, it's kind of part of the legend that we don't--

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 There's a beautiful concubine being like, "No, let's just leave it open. Let's just leave it open.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 In fact, let's destroy it." And they're like, "Oh, she is pretty hot and she's smart.

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Maybe we'll do what she says."

160
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But local officials are like, "Listen, the rock did have a giant crack in it."

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Apparently there's other photographs showing that it was falling apart.

162
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's definitely a very, very interesting story

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 because we would not be set up for something like this in modern society, would we?

164
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Because if you think about it, back then women were not a really allowed positions of leadership in most countries.

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So this nine-tailed fox spirit would have to possess a concubine or a courtesan.

166
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Something like that.

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It could easily-- It could possess Taylor Swift and have a multimedia empire to wage war with, right?

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Taylor Swift releases her new album, Streets Run Red, from a Thousand Severed Heads,

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 and she's like singing this song and everyone's like, "I'll do this song. It's super good, isn't it?"

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And they turn and they've chopped off their buddy's head as they're driving in the car.

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They're like, "La la la, I love this song."

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I mean, you have someone who's possessing women in this day and age would have a million possibilities.

173
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 You could be a world leader, right? Angela Merkel's walking through her office one day and they're like,

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "Hey, Angela, what's up?" And she just keeps walking.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 She just like being called by her first name. It's Madame Merkel.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And then she just walks in her office and she opens up like a box and she presses a button,

177
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 a big red button that says, "Activate Fourth Right."

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And then Germany just starts to become like nuts again.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And everyone would be like, "We should have disconnected that button. I don't know why we left it in there."

180
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 She could become a direct world leader. She wouldn't have to be an advisor.

181
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So if this is real, women have so much power in the modern world that this foxtailed lady has infinite avenues to cause destruction.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Fascinating story. Fascinating story. Thanks for sending it over, Ampestown.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And again, quit breaking those rocks. We'll see what happens.

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Spiritual abortion. Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We're going to leave behind Japan. We tried.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Now we have that rock and there's like band-aids on it and some duct tape.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Ah, it's good enough. Four metaphysical prisms. That's good enough.

188
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Let's get out of here. We're flying away from Mount Nassu.

189
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 We are headed all the way out to Virginia.

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 [imitates flying]

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Spiritual abortion. Keep flying this carpenter copter.

192
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 We are headed to Loudoun County, Virginia. Specifically, we're headed to the Ivan estate.

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 The Ivan estate. Nowadays, it's just private farmland.

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But back in the 1750s, a giant stone manor house was built.

195
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And it was built for Thomas Mason. And it was huge.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It was big enough for his family. It was big enough for house guests.

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 All the servants who lived there as well.

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But shortly after it was built...

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 [imitates flying]

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 You're like Chewbacca showed up. That's awesome. The dimensional merge is real.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 No, that was a black bear was spotted on the property. This massive black bear.

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And you would be like, "Oh, dude, that totally sucks, man. This giant black bear."

203
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 That'd be terrifying back in the 1750s. Nowadays, I would just call someone and be like,

204
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 "Hey, get rid of this bear." But back then, you didn't have a phone.

205
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Back then, you had to take care of everything yourself.

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Or like one of your dudes had to go out and do that.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 You had a black bear walking around your property. It's not safe.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And then...that's bad enough, right? Black bear on your property.

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You might want to eat some bear steaks, but one day someone wakes up.

210
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 "Ooh, what time is it? I don't even have a clock. Clocks weren't invented. The sundial's outside."

211
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You turn and you look. The black bear was in their bedroom.

212
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 [growling]

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 The black bear. The black bear. It's in my room. And everyone ran into the room and there was nothing there.

214
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Then, you know, like a week or two later, someone else is sleeping in bed.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 [snoring]

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Got the little sleepy time cap with a little fuzzy ball on the end.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 [growling]

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Okay, I'm stop doing the bear noises. They're under my throat.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 They wake up. There's a giant black bear at the edge of their bed.

220
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 What they realize...

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I don't know why they didn't immediately move out, but what they realize is there's no way for this bear to be getting in the house.

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And bears are known for a lot of things. Me and Sneaky isn't one of them.

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 You would have heard this thing coming through the house.

224
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Why is it just standing at the feet of people's beds and growling once they wake up?

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It's not like eating them. It's not doing anything fun.

226
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's not teaching them about the bear necessities. Nothing.

227
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 They realize this is a ghost bear.

228
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 This bear has all the attributes of a ghost, except it's a bear.

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Animal ghosts, as far as we know, are incredibly rare.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 We see a lot of ghost dogs, guarding graveyards and things like that, demonic dogs.

231
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 But a ghost bear.

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 This bear was seen off and on at Ivan Estate over the course of 150 years.

233
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 The last family that lived in the house, this was the 1900s.

234
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 One night, they were like, "We're done."

235
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They actually fled the house in the middle of the night because they got tired of waking up with a giant black bear at the foot of their bed.

236
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 They're like, "We're out."

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 They were the last people to actually live in the house.

238
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 This thing was appearing with such regularity that it was putting too much stress on the family.

239
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 So from the 1900s on, no one lived in the house. Eventually, a fire destroyed the abandoned mansion.

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And nowadays, it's farmland.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 But where this house stood, people still see this black bear wandering around the area.

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It's interesting because just a couple days after I read that story, I found another ghost bear in 1860, Tower of London.

243
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 There was a guard in the place known as the Jewel Office.

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 That's where Anne Boleyn was held prisoner.

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And he's sitting there and he sees something begin to move and the gap where the door and the floor don't quite meet.

246
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 This shape is moving through it.

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It's flattened and it's coming through it.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And then it begins to slowly materialize, like rising mist, into the form of a bear.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Now he is a guard in the Tower of London. I don't know what they're guarding it from.

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 The place is called the Jewel Office, so maybe it's full of jewels?

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Scrooge McDuck swimming in there.

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 He has a gun. He has a gun with a bayonet on the end of it.

253
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And he actually runs this bear through. He stabs it right in the chest.

254
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Or probably actually more in the abdomen, because it's super tall. Getting into the chest would be hard.

255
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But he stabs this thing and the bayonet goes right through the creature and actually puts a notch in the door.

256
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And then he ran away, right?

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 What else are you going to do? You're brave enough to even try stabbing this thing.

258
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 They said he was never quite right after this. Like he was kind of a screw loose in the head.

259
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He was kind of like Batman.

260
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And he was a coward. That's how, you know, he's originally he was a guard and now he couldn't even guard his own breakfast from a mouse.

261
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 He was a coward.

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And so I'm sure he got fired. I don't think they let many cowards be guards.

263
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Now I read both of those accounts and it reminded me of the old legend.

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 In Europe, the original word for bear is lost to time.

265
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We don't know what it is.

266
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Because they believed if you muttered the original word for bear, a bear would appear.

267
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And bears were the equivalent to Godzilla back then.

268
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Like in medieval or dark ages Europe, if a bear showed up, your town is wiped out.

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 We did a story about a bear that laid siege to a Japanese village and it was just, I mean it annihilated these people.

270
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Bears would have been unstoppable in the 800s and the 900s and it really don't even want to see them today.

271
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 So the original word that early Europeans used for bear, we don't know what it is.

272
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 We don't know what it is.

273
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Imagine if there was a word that if you said a bear would show up and we don't know what it is, you'd be afraid to kind of use any words, right?

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So originally I thought, oh, not only would you become mute because you think you might accidentally summon a bear, you're like, oh, I can't say anything.

275
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I'm too scared.

276
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But originally I was thinking what if someone said the word in the Ann Bolin story, like he's like, oh, fuzz nut.

277
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And then the bear appears and is like, oh no, I said the word.

278
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But then I had another thought because I came across one more story.

279
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I saw this posted online by Pegasus3367.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 When she was a 10 year old girl, her grandpa took her frog hunting.

281
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Apparently this is a thing where they caught a bunch of frogs and then they would put them out of their misery.

282
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 They'd kill them and then they'd cut their legs off.

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 They're going to make fried frog legs or sell the frog legs to someone else.

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I hope we're not just doing it because they're like, yes, I just love cutting legs off things.

285
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 They would cut the legs off and throw the torsos in a pile.

286
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And later that night this girl will call her Pam.

287
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 She's sleeping and she hears, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

288
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 And she's like, oh, that's horrible.

289
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 That's horrible sound because she knows no frogs should be around.

290
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 They kill the entire population in their area.

291
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 She knows it has to be coming from the pile of supposedly dead frogs.

292
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 We must have missed one.

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So she goes out and she sees this pile of frogs.

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Right now you're eating frog legs.

295
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You're like, mm-mm.

296
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I love listening to Dead Rabbit Radio and eating the one thing he's never talked about.

297
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 She walks out to this pile of frog corpses and sure enough, on the top of the pile there's a frog kind of squirming around with no legs.

298
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 It's kind of like crawling as much as it can with no legs and she kills it.

299
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 She realizes we must have missed this one.

300
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 She stabs it and puts it back on the pile and goes back to bed.

301
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Two hours later, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

302
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And she's like, oh, great.

303
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So she goes back out.

304
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 She's like, I sure have a hard time sleeping when I ate all this fried frog legs.

305
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Definitely give me these nightmares.

306
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 She walks out there and it's not a nightmare.

307
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She sees this frog, the same frog that she had killed earlier still squirming around.

308
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And she's like, oh, I must have not done it right.

309
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So then she chops the frog's head off and buries the body.

310
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Now no one will know of my crime.

311
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 The next night, ribbit, ribbit, she's like, oh, great.

312
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 She wakes up to the sound of the frog and she's like, okay, now this is getting super terrifying.

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And the first two parts were pretty scary too.

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 She walks out and she can't figure out where the croaking is coming from.

315
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 She's looking at the pile.

316
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 She's looking at all the frogs.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 She can't figure out the source of the noise.

318
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 She can clearly hear this frog croaking.

319
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And she walks over to where she had decapitated and buried the frog.

320
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And she starts digging up the grave.

321
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 The frog is no longer there.

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Ribbit, ribbit.

323
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And she said to this day, she's still terrified of frogs.

324
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I started thinking about this.

325
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 The reason why we think, the reason why we recognize ghosts is because they're in locations or time periods where they shouldn't be.

326
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 If you were walking through a British mall and you saw standing at the end of a hallway, a woman in Elizabethan garb just kind of standing there,

327
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 you would think that's a ghost.

328
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You might not jump that close right away.

329
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 There might be an Elizabethan costume store nearby.

330
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But it, dang it, it's quite creepy.

331
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Stuff's still falling in here.

332
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 The reason why we think of ghosts is we wake up in the middle of the night, we go into the bathroom,

333
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 and you go to the bathroom and then you're washing your hands, you look up.

334
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And in the mirror behind you, there's a woman standing there with dripping wet black hair staring at you in the reflection.

335
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 And you know there's not supposed to be a creepy woman in your bathroom.

336
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 You know when you walk into your closet and there's a guy just hanging there,

337
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 you're like, "I clearly hung my bodies in the living room."

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 We know that ghosts exist because we see them in locations that they shouldn't.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 The reason why they know this was a ghost bear is it was appearing in the house, in a place where it shouldn't be.

340
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 I.e. the foot of people's beds.

341
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And it was not doing what a bear would normally do, which would be eating everyone and then making a good bullet porridge.

342
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Same thing with this frog, right?

343
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 She's hearing the noise in a place where she knows all the frogs should be dead.

344
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Here is my hypothesis.

345
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Ghosts are everywhere.

346
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Everywhere.

347
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 When you're walking through a mall, there very well may be a ghost walking through the mall as well.

348
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 You would not even...

349
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 If it's a ghost of a six-year-old girl who died in a horrible car accident when she was getting ready to pick up her favorite toy on Christmas Eve,

350
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 and now her ghost is in this mall, would you notice a six-year-old girl dressed in say, late 1990s fashion,

351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 or maybe even more current walking into the toy store?

352
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Would you even... Would that even register in your brain?

353
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Because we see kids in malls.

354
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Or you're at an amusement park.

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 You can just stand there and you see a happy family kind of looking out at Mickey Mouse waving at them and they're kind of waving back.

356
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And that's really a ghost family.

357
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 They were horribly crushed by the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

358
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 No, you wouldn't even register it.

359
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I think we may see ghosts all the time and we don't know it.

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And I thought about the same thing with ghost animals.

361
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Like, what if when you're walking around and you see a squirrel running by, you expect to see squirrels in your neighborhood?

362
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Squirrels are everywhere.

363
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That might be a ghost squirrel.

364
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Because that's where it's supposed to be.

365
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Now, if you went home and you woke up and there's a bunch of squirrels in your bed, unless you're Cinderella,

366
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 it would be very weirder when you look up at the sky and you see a bird soaring.

367
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Maybe that's a ghost bird.

368
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You know what I mean?

369
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 If you saw... If this bear was not in Ambulin's office,

370
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 if they were walking through the woods and they saw a bear just kind of walking through the woods,

371
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 no one would be like, "Oh, I saw a ghost today."

372
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Because we expect to see bears in the woods.

373
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 But maybe it was a ghost.

374
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Maybe that giant elk that you tried shooting during your hunt and you swear that you hit it,

375
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 but it got away, it could have been a ghost.

376
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 We register ghosts because they're in locations they shouldn't be.

377
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Usually, our houses, right?

378
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 But if that same ghost was walking down the street or standing in a mall,

379
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 or sitting on a park bench watching the sunset,

380
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 you would never think, "Dude, I saw so many ghosts today."

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They might actually be incredibly common.

382
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 We may see ghosts all the time, but because they don't register,

383
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 they're not doing something unusual, we're not interacting with them,

384
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 we just walk past a loving couple holding hands,

385
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 not knowing that they had died.

386
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 This is such an embarrassing episode.

387
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Not knowing that they had died on the way to their wedding,

388
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 you wouldn't even register it.

389
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 So maybe ghosts aren't a rare phenomenon.

390
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Maybe they are part of our daily lives, we just don't notice them,

391
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 because they're doing normal things, they're dressed in normal clothes.

392
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 They seem to be other humans living their lives,

393
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 when they're really just spirits living their afterlives.

394
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It makes you wonder how many people we see throughout the day are still with us.

395
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Just a hypothesis, of course.

396
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I do think if ghosts exist,

397
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 we should be seeing a lot more of them.

398
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 It shouldn't be so rare, because so many people die constantly.

399
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Maybe it's not rare.

400
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 In a way, it seems like every person you don't interact with could be a ghost.

401
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I know that's a super bold claim to be making, right?

402
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But the other day I was walking down the street and all the cars driving past me,

403
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 and you'd see sitting in the passenger seat,

404
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 some dude just staring out into the distance as the driver is silently continuing down the road,

405
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 could have been a ghost.

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 That's the argument I'm making, could have been a ghost.

407
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Or when you are walking down the street and you see,

408
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 they don't even have to be dressed in bell bottoms and stuff like that,

409
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 and you're groovy, and then they fade away, and you're like,

410
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 "Oh, that guy must have died back in the 60s."

411
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 No, people die in normal clothes, people dying clothes from today.

412
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 People just walking down the street, and you see like a young man just kind of standing there,

413
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 rubbing his tummy.

414
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He died of hunger, he died of hunger, he was right outside that Taco Bell.

415
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He actually died from eating the Taco Bell, he's rubbing his stomach in pain.

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "Oh, why did I eat there again?"

417
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 It could be that we see the world teeming with life,

418
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 but we could simply be surrounded by echoes of the dead.

419
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And we would never really know for sure,

420
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 unless we interacted with each and every person we saw walking down the street.

421
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I wanted this ending to be creepy, I wanted this ending to make you wonder,

422
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "Whoa, dude, is that dude dead?"

423
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But I'm basically encouraging you guys to walk up to everyone

424
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and tapping on the shoulder and being like, "Oh, okay,

425
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 just making sure you were still alive, sir. Have a good day!"

426
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And then you continue on, and you're tapping people on the shoulder,

427
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 "Don't do that, just sit back and think about every time you see someone,

428
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 every single time you see another human, your boss is walking up to you,

429
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 you're like, "La la la la la, I thought you died, sir, you can't give me orders."

430
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I don't listen to ghosts. Who knows, though, right?

431
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Who knows, there should be more ghosts than we actually see,

432
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 and we may be seeing ghosts all the time, they just blend in perfectly with their environment.

433
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 The only time we notice a ghost is when it's in a place it shouldn't be,

434
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 like your bedroom, or dressed in clothes not of the time,

435
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 like an Elizabethan ghost floating around modern-day London.

436
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 People would be like, "That's a ghost?"

437
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 So the next time, never mind, never mind, I won't stop giving examples,

438
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I think I kind of lost the spooky part.

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
