1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 A spell that will allow you to reach across space and time to talk to a US senator.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to Britain, where we meet a couple who are on the run.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Who's chasing them? They don't know.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But they do know why they're being chased.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Because of the screaming they heard underneath their house, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Do you know what I think, Dale? Actually, I'm a lot like Dale.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We're just gonna go ahead and get started. I don't have any housekeeping.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I do have to say though, if you guys are enjoying the show, please recommend me to your friends and family.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And even people you don't like, say, "Hey, I know we had some disagreements in the past."

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But listen to Dead Rabbit Radio. It's the best way to keep the show going.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Let's build that listenership up, guys.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story though.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Our first story starts off six days ago.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Depending on when you're listening to it.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 If you're listening to it today, six days ago.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But if you're listening to it a year from now, three hundred and seventy-one days ago.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Six days ago on Reddit.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 A question was put on a Reddit forum.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Is that what it's called? A subreddit. I guess subreddit is what it's called.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Six days ago. There's a post on a subreddit.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 The question is, "You start a new religion. What is it based on?"

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 This Reddit user says, "If I start in my own religion, it'd be based on forcing everybody to vote for Elizabeth Warren."

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And all things about glorifying Elizabeth Warren.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I think I'm obsessed with her in real life.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I'm like, "Okay, that's kind of weird."

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But it's getting, you know, the climate's getting more political.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The Democratic debates are coming up, 2020 election.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I can see someone wanting to say, "I want to start a religion that forces..."

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 This isn't political. I'm not going to get political, guys. Don't worry about it.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm not going to break my streak, but this guy wants to start a religion

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 to force everyone to vote for Elizabeth Warren.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Four days ago on another subreddit, another question appears.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 "You're stuck on a 14-hour flight. Which celebrity do you want sitting next to you and why?"

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 What would you ask them?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Same guy pops up. His answer?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Elizabeth Warren.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And I'd ask her about Democrat stuff and how she will oust Trump.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Now, these responses just kind of disappear into the sea of Reddit responses.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like, they don't stand out in any way, shape, or form.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 The reason why I found those was because of what happened 17 hours ago.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 17 hours ago, on Reddit, I have a...

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Again, I don't know the terms because I'm never really on Reddit that much.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I have a couple of subscriptions. I've talked about it before.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I mostly subscribe to the podcasting subreddits.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But there's two in particular that I check all the time.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Three unsolved mysteries.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I've gotten some stories out of there.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 High strangeness. I've gotten a lot of leads out of there.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And three kings. And three kings is a ritual subreddit.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So it's where people post rituals like one man hiding go seek, asa spades,

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 all of these things that you can do to evoke demons that run around in your apartment.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 One man hiding go seek since I mentioned that. That's an old one.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You take a teddy bear or a doll, and you cut a little hole in its back.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And I'm giving you... Don't try doing this.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 If you are going to do this, look it up online because I'm probably giving you the wrong instructions.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Don't blame me if a teddy bear murders you in your sleep, but you take a teddy bear,

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 you cut off your fingernail clippings, not your whole fingernail.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Clip your fingernails, that's what I meant to say.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Cut off some hair, put it in the bear or the doll, and put it in the bathtub,

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and then you go into a corner of your house and go, "I'm it!"

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And then you walk up and you touch the doll in your bathtub.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And then you say, "You're it!" And then you go hide, and you have to stay hidden for like six hours,

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 and you'll hear like little footsteps walking around, walking around your house looking for you.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And you can't fall asleep because it'll stab you in the eyes. That's like a specific rule.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And you can't be found or it'll stab you in the eyes.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Now I don't know how anyone knows this. Apparently this is an old game from Japan.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But that aside, so on the Three Kings, which is a famous ritual, Three Kings, elevator game as it went on here as well,

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 it's just things you can do, basically their interactive creepypasta, their campfire stories that you can play along with.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Totally fake. Totally fake. Every show often a real one might get snuck in there,

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 but I think for the most part they're totally phony.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So that's just a quick overview of what like the rituals are on this site.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Whether or not they're real, I don't know. I can tell you this one that we're about to say, "Most likely isn't real."

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 I think most likely this was made up by some guy who really, really likes Elizabeth Warren.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And so the reason why this whole thing came to my attention was I'm scrolling through the Reddit,

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I'm scrolling through Reddit and I see in my subscriptions a ritual for the "Talk to All" ritual.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And that's all it says, and then there's a picture of Elizabeth Warren. I'm like, "What?"

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Like, they had a picture of a spooky ghost or like a dark tree.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I would have just thought it was another stupid ritual someone made up. Never would have clicked on it.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Unfortunately for this guy, and fortunately for us, this was an odd enough combination to see Elizabeth Warren pop up in a ritual page that I clicked on it.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And now I present to you the "Talk to All" ritual.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It starts off, we have the photo of Elizabeth Warren, so basically that image is burned into your head the rest of your time you're reading this ritual.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And the first thing we see is it says, "Concerning the image." They want to get it right off the bat.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Why there's a picture of Elizabeth Warren here, which is very helpful, because that was very, very puzzling to me.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 "Concerning the image." This is on his thread. "Concerning the image." The person in the image is Elizabeth Warren.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 If you were trying to contact Elizabeth Warren with this ritual, you could use the image.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And I'm thinking, who else wants to contact Elizabeth Warren so bad that they're going to invoke the dark gods? They're going to create this ritual.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It goes on to say that supposedly this is a classic ritual from Japan.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And this guy just recently translated this ritual from Japanese.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And this ritual can be used to communicate with the living, the dead, and even an imaginary person.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So out of all of the humans that have ever existed, even including the fictional ones, this guy wants to talk to Elizabeth Warren.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So I don't even know if Elizabeth Warren's mom would want to talk to Elizabeth Warren over Benjamin Franklin or Gandhi or anything else.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But anyways, this guy has found that luckily this guy who's posted several times about how much he loves Elizabeth Warren

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 has stumbled across the Japanese spell that will allow him to talk to Elizabeth Warren.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What are the odds? What are the odds of this?

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Later on, someone asks him why Elizabeth Warren? And he goes, "Oh, well, it was just chance.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I put 50 names in a hat and I pulled out Elizabeth Warren."

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Looking at his Reddit history, we absolutely know that's not true.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 We absolutely know that's not true. The guy wants to start a religion around her.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Out of all the celebrities to talk to on a plane, he talks to Elizabeth Warren.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So I don't believe the hat story at all. So considering that's most likely false, I think that it shows that this whole thing is ridiculous.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But I know you're thinking, "Jason, just tell me how to talk to Elizabeth Warren."

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Okay, I'm getting to that.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 These are the things you will need to contact US Senator and Democratic nominee, not Democratic person running to be the Democratic nominee.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Don't pick up the phone and call her Congressional office. Don't write her a letter like most normal people.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Get these items. Get these items.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 A writing tool, pen or pencil. Two pieces of paper.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Two pieces of paper. Now, he's very specific. He says one of these have to be 8 by 11.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So you have to have one normal size piece of paper and the other one can be like legal or whatever the lame stuff is.

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 But he does say, this is very helpful to me, he goes, "Any material can be used as long as you can write on it with a pen."

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Yes, you can even use papyrus from Egypt. Thank you. I have so much of that stuff laying around and I've been wondering what am I going to use it for.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Thank you for letting me know that I can use papyrus from ancient Egypt for this made up ritual.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Next step, you also need an image of anyone you wish to contact.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It can be anything. It can be an image on your phone. It can be a drawing and he has a helpful example here.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 He goes, "If I was trying to contact Elizabeth Warren using this ritual, I'd load up this image on my phone."

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Next thing you need is a box and it can be any size, but it has to be big enough to fit an 8 by 11 piece of paper in it.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And the fourth thing you need, patience. Like I'm running out of patience when I was reading this guy's Reddit post.

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 These are the steps that you actually will go through to contact anyone leaving your debt.

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 If you want to contact a debt person, you have to talk to them between 12 a.m. to 59 a.m.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 If you want to talk to a living person, it's 3 a.m. to 11.59 p.m.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 You also need to turn off the light. So what you're going to do is on the piece of paper, you are going to write the name of the person you want to talk to

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 and helpfully the poster says nicknames are okay.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And this is a quote from his post. For example, "Since Donald Trump has referred to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas,

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 you may write Pocahontas on a piece of paper, just as an example."

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Very good. Let's just let him know. Just an example.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 My question is, what happens if you end up contacting Pocahontas?

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Like again, you have to be specific. You just can't put nickname.

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If people call me big guy, you're contacting any big guy.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Oh, I guess it's a photo of me. But why would you have a photo of Elizabeth Warren?

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 You write Pocahontas on it.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So I mean, again, he's just going to end up contacting an animated character or the actual Pocahontas,

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 a 16-year-old girl who died of typhoid. Just write down Elizabeth Warren if that's who you want to talk to.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I think you just wanted to keep typing her name.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Next step is you say this. And again, I just absolutely love that he has to keep saying that I'm just using her as an example.

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But this is what he says you have to chant.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 You write down Pocahontas on a piece of paper and then you go, quote, "I wish to speak and I shall hear the voice of Elizabeth Warren."

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And you have to say that four times and then you say, "I'm sure that I wish to contact this person."

139
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 You say, "I want to hear a voice," or "I want a reply in writing."

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 After that, you turn away from the box. So you have the photo of Elizabeth Warren.

141
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 You wrote Pocahontas on it. You put it in a box. You said, "I wish to speak and I shall hear the voice of Elizabeth Warren."

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And I don't have cable, so I can't watch CNN.

143
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And I don't have YouTube. I can't hear her voice that way or phone to call up her office.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I'm using this ritual. You say all that stuff four times. You turn around from the box.

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You don't look at the box for 20 seconds.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You look back at the box.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Now he says, "If you turn around and the piece of paper is missing, the ritual has failed."

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And you can't go back into that room for two days. Don't even dare.

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He said his Japanese ancestors never told anyone what happened if you went back in there within two days because it was so horrible.

150
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 So don't do it.

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 He gives a helpful hint that you should do it outside because of this.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So that way you don't invalidate one-fifth of your house by doing this in a room you can't go to.

153
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Just do it outside.

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So now you have evoked a glitchy ring level of Elizabeth Warren flickering in the woods.

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I'm here to talk to you. Talk to you.

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Don't do that in public, dude.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 First, actually, that'd be kind of funny to see someone doing this in public saying, "I want to hear Elizabeth Warren."

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But if there's a chance that the spell goes wrong, don't do it where I jog.

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And I don't jog. Don't do it where I walk through.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And if the paper disappears, if you eliminate matter from the universe and it magically vanishes, you've failed at the spell.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 That sounds to me like the most successful spell possible.

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 You can destroy evidence. You can destroy documents.

163
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 But that's a failure to this.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 You could take like all of the files the FBI wants and just write Pocahontas on them, throw them in a box, turn around, turn back.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 The files are gone.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 This guy should work for any company that's under investigation.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 But he does say this, "If you turn around and when you come back, there's green marks on the paper."

168
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The spell is a success.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You didn't disintegrate matter. You didn't destroy something that exists, which is completely impossible by all laws of physics.

170
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 There's just green marks on it, and that means you did the job right.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 If you said, "I want to get a letter," what you do is you check your mailbox, and within three days you will get a letter from Elizabeth Warren.

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 He helpfully says, "If you don't have a mailbox," who doesn't have a mailbox?

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But he helpfully says, "If you don't have a mailbox, just put the box in a safe spot and look in the box every three days, and eventually a letter will appear from Elizabeth Warren."

174
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In the box. Magically in the box.

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Now, again, I don't know. That seems like that would be more magical than just getting a circular from her, just getting an average letter.

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I would much rather just try to have something magically appear in the box from a U.S. senator.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But I have a mailbox just like 99% of all other people in the civilized world.

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So that wouldn't work for me. I would have to go and destroy my mailbox.

179
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I'd have to destroy every mailbox, etc., in town before I can magically make a letter appear.

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 However, you're saying, "Jason, I don't want the letter, man. I want to talk to Elizabeth Warren. I want to hear her voice."

181
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Very helpful. After the spell, go to sleep, take a nap, and in your dream, Elizabeth Warren will show up and talk to you.

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And to add to the creepy factor of all this stuff, he says, "People don't remember their dreams very often."

183
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Which is true. Most people don't remember their dreams.

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So you should do this ritual over and over and over again so you keep dreaming about Elizabeth Warren.

185
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So you'll remember her in your head.

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 To me, it almost feels like he's creating a tolpa of Elizabeth Warren.

187
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 If you did this ritual over and over and over again, and then kept going to sleep and trying to dream of Elizabeth Warren of a U.S. senator,

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 it's just, you're basically creating a tolpa at that point.

189
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Now, there's some big questions here. I mean, it's all nonsense. None of this is true.

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 If you want to do this, I don't think there's any blowback for it.

191
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I would much rather do this than play with the Ouija board, because this is 100% made up.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But I'm not worried about not being able to go in my bedroom because Elizabeth Warren may be in my closet.

193
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I'm not worried about that at all.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 The big thing is, in the original, he said you can talk to anyone living, dead, or imaginary.

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And a couple of the responses to this was, where's the imaginary thing?

196
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 How do I talk to an imaginary thing?

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Which is way more, I'd much rather talk to Darth Vader than Elizabeth Warren.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I'd much rather talk to Spider-Man than Elizabeth Warren.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 There's a whole universe of people out there that I'd rather talk to rather than Elizabeth Warren.

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Nothing against Elizabeth Warren, I really don't know much about her.

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But she's one of a hundred senators.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 That's it!

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 If you had your choice between talking to any mythological or imaginary figure,

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 or anyone living or dead, versus someone that I could literally write a letter to today,

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and probably get a response from in about two weeks,

206
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I'd much rather talk to Unicron or anybody.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So, people are like, where's the imaginary person spelled?

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 That's the one I want.

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I don't care about Elizabeth Warren.

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And he's like, when my religion comes, you will care about it.

211
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 No, he says, I haven't translated that part yet, from the original Japanese.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I.e., I haven't made that part up yet.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 We did get one person to try the ritual though.

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I can't just imagine what this guy's thinking reading these responses.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 One guy did do the ritual, and this was his response.

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It was very scary.

217
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I think I didn't do the ritual right, because there are like 15 Elizabeth Warrens outside my house right now.

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They keep saying America is a democracy, and no matter how much I correct them,

219
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 that it is a constitutional republic, they just won't go away, and keep multiplying.

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I don't know what else to do, please help.

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I'm crying and shaking right now.

222
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You can go to the Reddit thread itself and kind of see how he's responded to other people,

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 but he doesn't really seem, I thought he was trolling.

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I wasn't going to cover this at all, because I thought it was a troll.

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 But then when I saw his Reddit history, where he was talking about Elizabeth Warren,

226
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 it could still be a troll, it could be an astat, like he was trying to trick someone like me.

227
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But first I thought there's no one in the world who would come up with a ritual to talk to Elizabeth Warren at all.

228
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Out of all the stuff I covered, that seemed to be one of the most ludicrous statements.

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And apparently this is true.

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So I'm wondering how he's responding to this idea of 15 Elizabeth Warrens walking around this guy's front yard.

231
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 He might be a little jealous.

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Okay, so you're going Jason, great.

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 What's the point of all this?

234
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 First up I want to say, I'm not asking anyone to troll him or make fun of him or anything like that.

235
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I'm not making fun of the guy in particular, I'm making fun of the ritual.

236
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And I'm not trying to say, "Hey, let's go make fun of this guy."

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Don't go on Reddit and harass him or anything like that.

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The reason why I wanted to cover this is because I think this is indicative of magic systems in general.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I think unless you are looking at a spell that is thousands upon thousands of years old, I don't believe it.

240
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I don't believe someone can sit around and make up a spell today that works.

241
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I don't think it works that way.

242
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I don't believe that someone can sit down and go, "I'm going to create a ritual and that's going to help warp reality."

243
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "I'm going to look in the mirror, I'm going to play the mirror game, I'm going to do the Three Kings ritual, I'm going to do all this stuff."

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It will allow me to bend the multiverse to my will.

245
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I don't believe that at all.

246
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But a growing number of people do.

247
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I know I've talked a lot about wickens in the past and I'm not going to poop all over wickens again.

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But modern-day wickens really originated in the 1960s, when they talk about witches and medieval times.

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Completely different from the witches of today.

250
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 They're almost unrecognizable.

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 If I was back in the 1600s, I wouldn't be talking crap about witches or witchcraft.

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I wouldn't be like, "Oh, you guys are so phony."

253
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Because I'd get turned into a toad or I would just get beat to death by a bunch of women with brooms.

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But today it's like, "Ugh, I mean, you're basically using magic that's "magic" that's 60 years old tops."

255
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So I don't believe any of that, but a growing number of people do.

256
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And I think when this guy created this ritual, and yes, I do think he made it up,

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 when he created this ritual, I think he thinks that it works.

258
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And I find that so bizarre that I can make something up out of the blue and then assume that it will actually work.

259
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The chances of this guy casting the spell and dreaming about Elizabeth Warren is incredibly high.

260
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 The chances of me casting the spell and dreaming about Elizabeth Warren is incredibly low.

261
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I don't have such a desire to talk to Elizabeth Warren.

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 But if I did this ritual five days in a row and I was thinking about hanging out with Britney Spears

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 and I dream about Britney Spears, I want to think it's Tuesday night.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I always dream about Britney Spears on Tuesday nights.

265
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Like, I'm not going to attach any magical connection to it.

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 But we live in an age where people believe that stuff they made up is real.

267
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And that's an odd way to live.

268
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 It's an odd way to live.

269
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Someone else can make something up and I could be fooled into believing it.

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 But if I make it up and believe it's real, that's a whole other ballgame.

271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And speaking of that, well that was a bit longer than I thought it was going to go on.

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But speaking of living in a delusion, let's take a look at the interesting story of a couple in Britain.

273
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 This was actually a recommendation from Alexandra on Facebook.

274
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So thank you Alexandra.

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Keep sending your recommendations in.

276
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I know I haven't been covering them a lot lately, but they do tend to take a little more research than the other stories I cover.

277
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So let's go to England.

278
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Jolly old England.

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Home of meat pies and people getting their heads chopped off.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That was French Revolution.

281
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Meat pies and getting crossbows through the heart.

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Like King Richard.

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 So we're in Britain.

284
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 We're having a cup of tea.

285
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 We're sitting at home.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 We're wearing our bath robes.

287
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 We don't got anything on underneath it.

288
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It is a Wednesday morning.

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 We just got done dreaming about Britney Spears.

290
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 We walked backstage of her Vegas show and she's like, "Hey Jason, what's going on?"

291
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And she slowly takes her top up and you know you think you're looking at Britney Spears.

292
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 But anyways, you shake out the dream.

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You're like, "I can't."

294
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Back in reality, Jason.

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Back in reality.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 During your cup of tea, you see a flyer kind of like hanging on the inside of your door and you're like, "That's weird.

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I don't remember putting any flyers in my door."

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So you get up and you look at the flyer and this is what this flyer says.

299
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "Please help."

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 You're like, "Uh oh.

301
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I better keep reading before I actually help."

302
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Topist says, "Please help."

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 In August 2018, we discovered what we think is an illicit drug manufacturing factory running somewhere underneath our house.

304
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Women and children can be heard screaming.

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 We reported it to the police.

306
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 You first ignored us and then did not bother to listen to the secret audio recordings we made.

307
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 The recordings were made secretly in a 1.5 meter shaft tunneled into the sidewall of our basement.

308
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 All the recordings you can hear, women screaming, two foreign men talking in an automated machine running and flushing.

309
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 When it flushes, it emits a strong gas.

310
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And then it goes on to say more info like they hear the sound of motorbikes and police sirens inside this tunnel.

311
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 The tunnel itself is at 1.5 meters.

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So apparently, their story exists.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Back in August of 2018, there was this couple.

314
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Their names were Allen and Christine Tate.

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And they're living in their house and all of a sudden, it's weird because their information seems to be a little bit spotty, but it might just be them.

316
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But anyways, from what I could gather, they're sitting in their house and they smell an overwhelmingly scent of toxic gas.

317
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Like, not so much that they were dying, but it was so noxious.

318
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 That's what I was looking for.

319
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 They leave their house and they couldn't figure out the source of it.

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And from what I can gather at one point, they popped a hole in their wall to see if that's where the smell would get.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Because they said, "We don't use gas. We don't have natural gas."

322
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 They punched a hole in the wall to see if that's where the smell was coming.

323
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And that hole either led into their basement to tunnels underneath their house or allowed them to hear in the basement of a commercial building next door to their house.

324
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Again, very, very iffy on this.

325
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 They have their own weekly radio show and they have a bunch of podcast episodes, but the audio quality isn't that good.

326
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So I had a really hard time kind of piecing the story together.

327
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And so they said they're smelling this gas.

328
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So then they start hearing sounds through the tunnel, like through the little shaft in their wall.

329
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 They hear the sounds of women and children screaming.

330
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They hear the sounds of police siren.

331
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And they're saying, "About two miles away, there's an old World War II bunker."

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And we believe there's a tunnel leading from that bunker underneath our house to the property next door.

333
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And you can hear an engine running and we think that's what's making the gas fill our house.

334
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Now they go to the authorities and they go, "Our house is filling up with this horrible, horrible smelling gas."

335
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And the authorities, their first question is, "Did you eat Taco Bell?"

336
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And they're like, "No, we didn't."

337
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That was our first suspicion too.

338
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 But we haven't eaten Taco Bell in a while and the police are like, "Okay, this might actually be something then."

339
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 So don't go back to your house. Don't go back to your house.

340
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And they're like, "Well, we kind of have to."

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But so they do end up like sneaking back onto their property.

342
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And that's when they hear the noises and they leave the tape recorder out.

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And every so often they'd come back and they'd pick the tape recorder back up and they'd listen to it.

344
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And each tape had about five hours of audio on it.

345
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 They'd listen back to the tape, they'd hear screaming.

346
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 They'd go to the police and say, "Listen, we have these cassette tapes that have the sounds of these people screaming.

347
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 We think there's a tunnel underneath our house. We think you need to do something."

348
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And the police say, "No, we're not going to do it. We already checked the Taco Bell angle. We don't know what else to do."

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And the guys, and Alan and Christine are like, "Well, can you listen to the tapes?

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I mean, maybe if you listen to the tapes you can tell us that's not what it is or that we're crazy or something like that."

351
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And according to the tapes, the police refused to listen to the cassettes. They didn't want to listen to the tapes at all.

352
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And so finally Alan was like, "Listen, can you at least go to the place that's next to us?"

353
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And we think they're a drug manufacturer. We think the smell is a noxious gas that's coming out of the equipment for making drugs.

354
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I don't know how they make that leapologic, but anyways, Alan and Christine say,

355
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 "We think the place next to us is a drug manufacturing lab, and maybe they're manufacturing underground and they're bringing them up into the place,

356
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 but why don't you go check out that place next to us?"

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Now an interesting thing happens. The police say, "We will check out the place next to you. We'll do that."

358
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 They then call, this is all according to the tapes, the police then call up the commercial place and say,

359
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "We want to come and check out your place of business." And the place of business says, "Cherry, oh mate, you can totally do that,

360
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 but not right now. Give us three weeks." And the police go, "Okay."

361
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And so after three weeks, the police go to the place and it's empty.

362
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And the police are like, "Well, that's what we thought. There's no drugs here."

363
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And Alan and Christine are like, "You told him you were coming. You waited three weeks."

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 So what do you think was going to happen?

365
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 At this point, Alan and Christine, they originally made their money buying businesses and then liquidating them.

366
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They live in a van now. And they are so certain that there is nefarious things going on underneath that house.

367
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They drive around England passing out these flyers and just putting them in people's doors, putting them on their windshield wipers,

368
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and the flyers direct people to their SoundCloud page where you can hear samples of these audio tracks,

369
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 and to their change.org petition to try to get the local police to, and I don't think I ever said where this was at.

370
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I think I just said it was in Britain. And to try to get the local police in their area, it was some British place.

371
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So you know, I have a hard time with the geography over there. I know that's not helpful, but it was like in Southwest England.

372
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Anyways, Glauchestire. Glauchesthire. So anyways, that's where it took place.

373
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So, you're trying to get the local police. As far as the last article I saw on this, they have 106 signatures on their change.org petition.

374
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But I know your big question is, Jason, did you listen to the audio recordings?

375
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Now, I didn't listen to the 5-hour audio recordings because I have stuff to do.

376
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I watched Batman vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles instead. That movie is actually really good.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 It was actually funny, shockingly funny. Check it out.

378
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 But instead of doing research for the show, I watched that movie.

379
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But I did watch the... I did listen to the smaller clips.

380
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It definitely heard the sound of a motorbike. Now, that could have been from outside.

381
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 You know my microphone picks up cars driving down the street.

382
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But there are... there's like audio files labeled "woman screaming".

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And you click on it and there's a woman going, "Come on, Gary! No! Don't!"

384
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's not an EVP. It does sound like a woman's actually saying that.

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 It doesn't sound like a trick of the mind or anything like that.

386
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 But that's fairly inconclusive. And I will say this. It's like an EVP, where you know you kind of have to like, strain your ear to hear it.

387
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But imagine an EVP where you're trying to figure out what's going on and then the sound of a Harley just...

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 *BURP* right next to your ear. So use caution when listening to these, because they get really, really loud out of the blue.

389
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So here's the question. This is really what I want to look at.

390
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Going off the other story, the Elizabeth Warren delusion thing. Believing something so much you know that you made it up yet it becomes true.

391
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Is that at play here? Are these people just driving around in their van, passing these out because they believe this thing?

392
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 When I first read it, I thought, "The gas. The gas made them hallucinate the noises."

393
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Which is possible. It's not Scarecrow's fear toxin, which he used against Leonardo in Batman vs. the Ninja Turtles.

394
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 He thought all of his brothers were dead. It was quite tragic.

395
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But it's not... it would wear off and Scarecrow's fear toxin also doesn't affect audio recordings.

396
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So the first off I thought maybe they just got a lot of the gas and they were hallucinating it.

397
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It's possible that's what started this and then the audio recordings are just picking up something else.

398
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Here's the thing. I think there might be something to this story.

399
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Now it doesn't... there may be a... this is the thing that again we see a lot in these type of stories.

400
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 There may be a tunnel leading from World War II bunker underneath their property over to the next building.

401
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 There may be people in that tunnel talking and screaming and riding their motorcycles around.

402
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 But to take that leapologic to drug trafficking is it can't just be there's some hobos living under your house.

403
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 It can't just be there's some kid with his motorbike underneath there, riding around and turning on a machine and pumping smoke everywhere.

404
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 It has to be a consp... a criminal conspiracy. The police are involved in everything like this and it's you and your wife against the world.

405
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I do honestly believe there probably is a tunnel under their house and there probably are people in that tunnel.

406
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 That actually sounds quite plausible. But to then say ergo they must be manufacturing drugs and the police are covering it up and they're on...

407
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 They never spend more than one night in one location. They live in their van now. They drive around England, not just town.

408
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 They never spend more than one night in any one city. They've changed their entire way of life because of this.

409
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Now, if you got ran out of your house because of noxious gas, because some teenagers were goofing off in a tunnel or a bunch of hobos were living down there

410
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and every so often a woman was like "Gary stop doing that! Give me the crack pipe!"

411
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 That's not compelling. That's not something that gives you a purpose in life.

412
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 These people before they had a successful business buying and selling stuff.

413
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 They were doing kind of every business but they were doing well.

414
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 But then all of a sudden they went from being a couple living in a house to champions fighting for truth, justice and the Britain way.

415
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 They became lone warriors against a faceless bureaucracy and a corrupt organization.

416
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 The tunnel is most likely true. But the story coming from the tunnel, I believe, has been embellished.

417
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 They may believe it's true just like the Elizabeth Warren guy may believe it's true.

418
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 It's not in the tunnel. He doesn't believe in the tunnel unless Elizabeth Warren is down there.

419
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 But believing that fictional story has given their lives purpose.

420
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Believing the myth has made them mythical heroes.

421
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 There's a chance they're right. There's a chance they're right.

422
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 It's most likely something so mundane that wouldn't force people to become traveling truth seekers.

423
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Sometimes we just have to admit to ourselves the world can be mundane.

424
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And no matter how many magical rituals you make up or how many faceless organizations that are after you,

425
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 at the end of the day you are just an ordinary person living in an ordinary world.

426
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 It may not be the most exciting fate. It may not be the greatest experience.

427
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 But sometimes the truth is just black.

428
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Just gotta eat your oatmeal and maybe you'll find a real adventure down the road.
