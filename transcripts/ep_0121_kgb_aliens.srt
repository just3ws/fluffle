1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,960
 Then, we take a look at the KGB and a close encounter of the "turned" kind.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,760
 And then we take a look at a man who made it his life mission to not only count, but

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:31,440
 contact the aliens in our very own solar system that, by his estimate, numbered around 22 trillion.

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,960
 Today, I'm Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,800
 [music]

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I lied. I am having a great day.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,120
 But it's snowing outside. I hate this snow. I hate everything that has the word snow in it.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,440
 I hate snow cones. Those are quite disgusting. It's just water with gross kool-aids spilled on it.

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,040
 I hate snowboarding. I think it's kind of lame. Skiing is better, but I hate that too.

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,160
 I never saw a movie snow piercer, but if I saw it, I'd hate it. I hate Supreme Leader,

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,720
 Snoke. Anything that has the word snow in it is terrible. Snowballs are pretty dumb. I'd rather

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,960
 throw a rock. And it's snowing outside right now. And I sometimes despise humanity for not being

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,040
 allergic to snow. Snow is nature's dandruff. And people always talk about, "Oh, snow looks so pretty."

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,800
 Okay, it does. When it's hundreds of miles away on a mountain—I guess people don't have eyesight

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,320
 that good—when it's tens of miles away on a mountain, yes, snow is beautiful. But when you

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,560
 have to walk through it, it's terrible. And humanity, I wish we never settled in areas with snow.

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,120
 The idea that a sentient species could go, "This place is cold and inhospitable for two months

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,840
 out of the year. Let's live here." I wish everyone just lived in the desert. Including me,

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,880
 despite it's dangerous it is. You got Mongolian deathworms and desert yetis everywhere.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,360
 Cacti chasing you down the street. The snowmobiles—yeah, I don't like those either. Well, I mean,

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
 comparatively, they're okay. But anyways, anyways, I like the sound they make. But other than that,

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,120
 and they kind of look cool with the treads, but whatever. I hate snow. I hate it all. Snow was a

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,640
 bad guy in Hunger Games. Nothing good comes out of snow. And snowmen—I know your secret. You're

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,240
 not really a snowman. You're just three balls of snow with some carrots on your face. Usually just

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,200
 one. I hate you, snow. Don't make me slip and follow my way to work tomorrow. I hope you didn't

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
 hear me say I hate you. Okay, let's go ahead and get started with this snowless episode. I'm never

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,920
 going to do a snow spiericy. We're going to move on to our next—our first story has no snow. It's a

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,080
 no-snow zone. This is an interesting one. It's short, but it's still interesting. So a lot of you

30
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,400
 guys—let me back up here for a second. So back up, and I haven't even started yet.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,320
 Back in the 1980s, there was this voodoo priestess in Congo, I think, a place in Africa.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,040
 I'm still stuck on that Ebola episode. There was a voodoo priestess in Africa. She saw that there

33
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,240
 was a civil war going on in a place. I don't remember the name of it, but details are not

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,400
 important. And she decided to exploit the divisions in this country that I don't remember. So she

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,560
 raised an army, but she didn't have any weapons. So she gave her army sticks, stones, and voodoo dolls.

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,920
 Spoiler alert, they got stomped. But her nephew, also a practicing voodoo—whatever the term is,

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
 I know this episode's off to a great start. Also—well, he's a warlord, basically. Also a

38
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,640
 practicing—he's a voodoo practitioner and a warlord. Let's say that. You know him. Everybody

39
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:02,320
 knows him. His name is Kony. So Kony started the Lord's Resistance Army. It was a huge contingent

40
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,040
 of it was child soldiers that he kidnapped from villages, made the kids kill their parents so

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,320
 they'd have nowhere to go, so they have to stay in the army. He's a brutal, brutal man. He controlled

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,040
 them through fear and violence and voodoo. He was a practitioner of the voodoo religion. I don't

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,600
 know if it's called voodoo over there, but similar practices. I don't know. Similar—okay,

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
 let's see, guys. I'm just reading articles on this stuff. Anyways, so if someone's like,

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,480
 "No, no, it's not actually called voodoo. It's called this. I apologize." But anyway, so he uses

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,600
 dark magic, we'll say. He uses dark magic and fear and violence and all this stuff to control

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
 his army. Now, the reason why we know about Kony was back in 2012, there was that big social

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,880
 movement, Kony 2012, and Jason Russell had a group called Invisible Children, and his goal was to

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,120
 bring about the end of Kony and to free those child soldiers. Admirable goal. Admirable goal.

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
 And so they started this huge social movement, and people were changing their profile picture.

51
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
 It was called slacktivism because people were doing very little things, but they felt really good

52
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 about it because they were part of this Kony movement. The video, Invisible Children, I think

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,400
 it was called, the video that Invisible Children produced was one of the most watched videos of

54
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,360
 that year. It was this huge phenomenon, and it did bring a bunch of attention to Kony. And people

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840
 who had never heard of the Civil Strife, never heard of the child soldiers, never heard of many of

56
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,040
 that were now aware of it. The eyes of the world were on Kony. Now, how do you strike at a target?

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,240
 Kony didn't have drones. He couldn't really send over a 12-year-old assassin with an AK-47.

58
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,560
 So how do you strike at an opponent 2,000 miles away? Magic, of course. So, I mean,

59
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 whether or not Voodoo works, I think depends on your own personal beliefs. I'm personally not

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,560
 scared of Voodoo. I don't think it would work. I know Voodoo wouldn't work on me. I see it as

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
 something that is more something that you buy into the superstitions for it to work. But I could

62
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,880
 be wrong. I've never had anyone cast the Voodoo spell on me. Maybe they did. Maybe that's why

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,160
 it's snowing. But what's interesting is you had Jason Russell, and Kony 2012 is blowing up, and

64
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,080
 everyone's looking at this guy, everyone's looking for him, and Jason Russell starts to have

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,240
 weird thoughts, we should say. Now, he is under a lot of pressure because he went from being a

66
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,400
 nobody to being world famous like that. Like, it is very, very hard for a average person to become

67
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,840
 famous. It's a lot of pressure. It's a super weird attack on the human psyche. I think athletes,

68
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,680
 it's interesting because athletes start off, they're usually famous at their high school,

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,200
 and then they go to college, and now they're famous nationally to a certain degree, but definitely in

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,840
 their state. And then if they play pro ball, now they're nationally famous, but they have that slow

71
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,640
 buildup of the fame. Whereas singers and actors and activists and stuff like that, politicians

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,880
 can become famous overnight, and they can really, really mess with you. All of a sudden you feel

73
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,280
 self-important stuff like that. But anyways, so Jason Russell is this normal guy who now is world

74
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,760
 famous, and he's feeling the pressure of it. He's starting to have these weird thoughts. He needs

75
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,680
 to take a break. Him and his family go on vacation. They go to see the movie The Lorax, the movie about

76
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,800
 Danny DeVito trying to get people to recycle, and that's a bad description of it. But anyways,

77
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,840
 which would have made it a better movie? He's in The Lorax and he's watching it, and he said

78
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:39,120
 he felt that the movie The Lorax was talking to him. And then he got this nugget in his head,

79
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,640
 not literally, but he got this thought in his head, a kernel, again not literally, in his head,

80
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:52,320
 that if he didn't get to New York within 12 hours, Coney would win. Becoming obsessed with this thought,

81
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,280
 he needs to get to New York in 12 hours. And then the next thing that happened was the famous footage

82
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,960
 of Jason Russell nude in public walking down the sidewalk, freaking out. People said that he was

83
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,960
 masturbating in public that actually wasn't true. Self-park made a big joke about that. That was

84
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
 kind of the meme. He wasn't doing that, but he was like doing jumping jacks and calphexetics and

85
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,760
 walking back and forth, and mutter knew himself and things like that. He went mad. He had a nervous

86
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:24,960
 breakdown. And the conspiracy theory is that that wasn't just because of the fame, that wasn't just

87
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,640
 because of the pressure, that was because of a successful voodoo spell that Coney actually cast on

88
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:38,560
 Jason Russell. It's an interesting theory and there's not much to back it up. Really, the best

89
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,600
 evidence I found was from TMZ, where they're interviewing someone who knew Coney. I think it

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,880
 was a child soldier or someone who had worked in that region. He's like, "Oh yeah, no, that was

91
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,920
 totally a voodoo spell." Absolutely. That's exactly what it looks like. A voodoo spell got cast on him.

92
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,520
 That's what it looks like when you're cursed. So, I mean, in the realm that we live in, in the realm

93
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,720
 that Dead Rabbit Radio exists in, all the craziest stuff we talk about it, that's not the craziest

94
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,800
 thing I've ever heard of. It is interesting because after that, Jason Russell became a meme. Coney

95
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,400
 pretty much disappeared from the spotlight. Invisible children still around. It's still trying to free

96
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:29,200
 those soldiers, but definitely crippled the movement. Definitely cast a long shadow on the Coney 2012,

97
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,800
 because now you really can't discuss Coney 2012 without discussing Jason Russell's breakdown.

98
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,280
 He's doing better now. He said that it took him about a week or two to get back in to

99
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,840
 find himself again. There's actually a great video I'm putting in my YouTube links

100
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,080
 called the story of Coney 2012. There's Internet Historian did, and it's a great video.

101
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,680
 It's great overview, and it has the interviews from Jason Russell where he talks about that breakdown.

102
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,360
 Was he cursed by Coney? Was the spell successful? Did Coney use ancient magic to take out an enemy

103
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,240
 who was using modern technology to stop him? Who knows? But it's definitely an interesting theory,

104
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
 and I wanted to share it with you guys. Next story we're going to look at is an interesting one.

105
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,200
 Again, it's fairly short, but I think it shows one of the problems that I have with modern UFO

106
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,680
ology. So apparently there was some KGB documents that the CIA got a hold of. Now right there,

107
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,440
 I'm like immediately suspect about this story, because it already sounds a little too James

108
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,920
 Bond-ish for me. But anyways, the CIA gets a copy of these KGB documents. All the articles I found

109
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,440
 said one of two things. One, President Gorbachev, President Mikhail Gorbachev, President of the

110
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,240
 Soviet Union at the time, believed that UFOs existed and more steady needed to be done on them.

111
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,520
 And the UFO sites are like, see look at this president of the USSR believes in UFOs. And yes,

112
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,880
 everyone believes in unidentified flying objects. And yes, we should do more investigating on them

113
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 to find out if it is a plane or a duck or a balloon. I don't think Gorbachev is saying when he says

114
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,720
 UFOs are real, he's not saying aliens are real, and that's a problem I see with a lot of conspiracy

115
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
 sites. He's just saying, yeah, we don't know what they are and we should figure it out. And there's

116
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,840
 a huge leap there between that and they're coming from another planet. And I do believe in aliens,

117
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,360
 but you know, I've talked about that before on the show either. I don't think they come from

118
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
 other planets. I think they're from here. But see, that's the thing. I could quibble all day long

119
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,200
 with people who believe in crop circles and reptilians and Arcturians and Pleiadians and

120
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
 stuff like that. We can quibble about the details all day long. We're both idiots,

121
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,880
 because we both don't have anything to back any of it up. I have my theories, they have their theories.

122
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,720
 But Gorbachev said that we should study UFOs, which is, and of course you have a giant country and

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,560
 you have a bunch of nukes and you're at war with another country. Of course you want to know what's

124
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,560
 flying in your sky. But in your life, that's not the whole story, because that would just be lame.

125
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,920
 I wouldn't just cover that. I would just waste your time for three minutes talking about it.

126
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:12,960
 Also in these documents came a story of KGB soldiers facing a UFO. And again, the UFO sites are

127
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,160
 like, "Oh my god, it's proof." I'm going to read you this story. And if you've ever done any research

128
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,600
 on UFOs or aliens or ever watched an episode of the X-Files or got stoned and watched H and Aliens,

129
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,280
 whatever your information is on aliens, you tell me if this story sounds like any other event you've

130
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,800
 ever heard of. And the reason why I say that, because generally, if it is a real, if aliens are real,

131
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,000
 if I see a tiger in the woods and 50 years later someone else sees a tiger in the woods, we're going

132
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,640
 to describe the same thing. We're going to be like, "Yeah, it's like a big cat has these stripes."

133
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,520
 If I see eight penguins carrying a keg, I'm going to be like, "Oh, this is what they look like. There

134
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,200
 was eight of them. This is what a penguin looks like. They had a keg." And then a couple years later,

135
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,440
 you see eight penguins carrying a keg. Or just eight penguins and a keg sitting there. You're going to

136
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
 go, "Those penguins are awfully long-lived." And then you're going to be able to describe to me the

137
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
 same thing. That's the problem with aliens and UFOs is like they're constantly being described in

138
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,280
 different ways. And yet we're supposed to believe all of them. Anyways, I thought debunking aside,

139
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,400
 debunk all that stuff aside, I thought this was a funny story. But again, it has nothing,

140
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,400
 it's completely bonkers. The fact that any UFO site gives us any credence just diminishes the whole

141
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,680
 idea. Bunch of, they don't even know when this happened. I'm angry. I've realized how angry

142
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 this story makes me. Because I had to read about it over and over and over again. And they're like,

143
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,000
 "This is proof." And it's so funny because now that I realize, I don't really get angry that much on

144
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,280
 this show. Or at least I don't show it. Anyways, undated event in an unknown location. Proof.

145
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,320
 Remember, this is proof. This is being held as proof. Somewhere in Antarctica. So maybe there are

146
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,800
 penguins with a keg. These KGB agents, for whatever reason, are in Antarctica. And they start to see

147
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:06,560
 these glowing lights, these red, green, and yellow lights in the sky. In one of the articles, it said,

148
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,840
 "For an unknown reason, someone picked up a SAM, so a surface air missile. For an unknown reason,

149
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,800
 someone picked up a surface air missile and fired it." Well, I'll tell you the reason why

150
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
 he fired it. It's not unknown. There's a big object floating around, flashing lights at you.

151
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,600
 And you're the KGB. You beat up shop owners. It's not like they're like, "Let's have a reason

152
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
 discussion with this orb." They're gonna blow it up. They blow up everything. The KGB was like one

153
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,400
 of the most brutal secret police in world history. And they're like, "I wonder why they did it?"

154
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,440
 Because they're nuts. And also they're in Antarctica. There's not a lot to do there. That's why the

155
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,680
 penguins have the keg. Anyways, so the KGB shoot down this craft of blinking lights and it crashes.

156
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,240
 And then five aliens with large heads and large black eyes come out. And you're like,

157
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,920
 "Jason, that is familiar. What are you talking about? Those are gray aliens. Everybody has seen

158
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,160
 those before. I've seen those in movies. Wait, hold on. Let me finish." The five aliens then

159
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:23,040
 merge Voltron style into a giant ball. So they go, "Bleugh." And like with 1991 Terminator 2,

160
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,320
 special effects. Blup. Not even that. 1991 Lawnmower Man special effects. Blup. And begin spinning

161
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:38,080
 around as a giant ball. I have never in 30 years of researching UFO stuff encountered a story where

162
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:46,400
 five gray aliens turn into a ball. If this story was real, then all the... you encounter ball aliens

163
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:53,040
 constantly. Again, if it's real, it's real. And you would have common things among the sightings.

164
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,600
 The Roswell aliens weren't just all like their bodies. You're just laying in the desert and then

165
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 it's like liquid metal and they start blub blub blub blub and turn. I've never heard that before.

166
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,840
 This is obviously made up in these websites. Multiple websites were running this story.

167
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,400
 It doesn't pass the smell test at all. Anyways, it gets stupider. It gets way stupider. So the ball

168
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,880
 spinning around now. The alien ball is like, "Woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh,
