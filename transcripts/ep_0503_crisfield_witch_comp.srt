1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Could a simple question have a paranormal answer?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And then we travel to Chrisfield, Maryland, where a man is at war with a witch.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Is it possible that an old, timey remedy could end the witch forever? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [music]

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have a great weekend.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Cyan River.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Cyan, thank you so much for supporting the show. Great name as well. Very beautiful, very evocative.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Now Cyan, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy, but we're not going to go anywhere just yet.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I want to have a little comment about yesterday's episode, okay?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So yesterday's episode just kind of ended, and it seemed to depress a lot of people.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 A couple of you reached out to me and was like, "Hey man, is everything okay? Is everything okay? Misty, I appreciate it."

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 A lot of people did that actually, but everything's okay. It's funny because that's not the way I intended on ending that episode.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Can't think of a good name also. I was talking to them on YouTube as well about this.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 That wasn't the original ending of the episode. It was very emotional.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 If you haven't listened to it, it was an episode about committing suicide while you were asleep,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 and I was relating a story of a friend of mine who had killed himself.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And it's funny because even in the episode I go, I didn't intend the episode to be this dark.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I just was talking about the subject, and it was obviously hard for me to talk about.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Hope is what I was trying to get across. I was supposed to have a more uplifting ending.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Life is about hope. That's one of the biggest factors in, I believe, your quality of life, is how much hope you have.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And it was supposed to be basically like, "What? My friend who killed himself, maybe he killed himself, maybe it was an accident.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I don't know. I don't know all the specifics." But I have hope that it was something different.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And that maybe misplaced hope, that maybe, like I used the analogy of the life raft,

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 it may be something that I'm clinging onto that doesn't have any rationale.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But I hope for a better answer than the one reality has presented to me.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It was supposed to have a hopeful ending. It was supposed to be like,

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 "We move forward and we try to find truths in things that don't mean to make sense,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 but we have hope that in the end they will make sense." All of that got lost,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 because I basically just kind of trailed out at the ending, and then the episode just ended.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So I wanted to let you guys know that, one, I'm 100% fine. I'm not super depressed or anything about it, too.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I've always seen this show. We talk about dark topics. We talk about paranormal,

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 conspiracy, true crime, stuff like that. And I think a lot of you guys have picked up on this.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I like to-- I don't mind telling a scary story. I don't even mind creeping you guys out,

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 or maybe even sometimes bumming you guys out. But I hope for a better future.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And I look at all of these stories. I try not to focus on ones that leave you with super-negative emotions.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Sometimes it can make you question things like the justice system, or just justice in general.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It can make you question things about what is reality and things like that.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm not trying to sugarcoat stuff, but at the end of the day, I always try to be more hopeful.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm a very hopeful person, and I think that comes across on the show.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Yesterday's episode-- I'm not really apologizing for it. I think it was a good story,

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 but I think that I didn't really get to the ending of it, which is,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I have hope that things will make sense in the end. I hope you guys feel the same way.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I don't want to be about scaring people.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 There's a lot of conspiracy theorists who do that, and that's their bread and butter,

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 is they say, "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, the world's going to end,

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 and the globalists are going to come in, and they're going to do all this horrible stuff."

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You buy my merchandise now, because tomorrow, you may not have a chance.

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 That was a pretty good impression of a particular conspiracy theorist,

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 but I'm not just putting it all on him. There's a lot of people who do that.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I don't want to be the person who sells fear like that.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I'll make you scared of the boogie man or the faceless man in your kitchen,

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 or Chester Cheetah in the bathroom, or the dog eating the cereal.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I like to make you scared, but I don't ever want to make you guys feel hopeless.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I see a lot of entertainment value in what we're talking about.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I feel like at this point, I might be rambling, but I just wanted to clear that up.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yesterday's episode was supposed to end on a hopeful note,

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 that sometimes we hold on to things that may not actually be true,

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 but we hope they are, because it's a more satisfactory answer

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 than the one that reality leaves with us.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And sometimes hope is all you have to cling to.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 That was how I originally wanted that to go across,

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 instead I just kind of got quiet and edited out honestly about

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 a minute and a half of me just sitting there quietly,

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 trying to think of how to recover that ending,

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and then I just go, "There's no way I can do that."

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So, I wanted to clear that up. Everything's going great on my end.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I hope everything's going great for you guys.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Hope is one of the most underrated, yet powerful things in our life.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 It is the one thing that no matter how bad things are,

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 hope for a better tomorrow can really make a big difference.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So that is my... I hope that made sense. I hope that made sense.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Here we go.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Saiyan, you got the keys to the Jason Jalopy?

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I'm getting a nod.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 We are leaving behind hope. Hope floats.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Where did that movie take place?

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Nowhere. Hope floats USA.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 We're leaving behind the blockbuster video store that was playing

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Hope floats because it's 1998.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We are driving out to Stockton, California.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So you know where this store is taking place?

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 If you know anything about Stockton, California, yes.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It's the meth capital of the world.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So when Stockton were going to be in a man,

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 he goes by the user name Thoughtbot100.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Now this is actually a pretty quick story.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I said I was going to do uplifting stories this episode,

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 and this story definitely uplifts my spirits because

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 poses a very serious question to us.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We walk into Thoughtbot's house. It's half dismantled.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It only has two walls.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 The other walls he removed because he's building another house somewhere else.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 We walk into his house. There's two walls, half a ceiling,

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 one third of a floor.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And we go, "Hey Thoughtbot,

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 we heard that you have a challenge for us skeptics,

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 us meth skeptics. We don't believe that...

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Well, we believe meth exists.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 We're not skeptical of the existence of meth,

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 you know, I'm always talking trash about meth on my podcast and stuff like that.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And he turns around, he does actually have a great question for us, though.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 He turns around, this is the question he posted on Reddit.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 The question that made me go, "Hmm, checkmate, methhead.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I think you finally, I think you finally, uh,

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I think you finally made me a meth believer."

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 The conceit is this, he says, as he takes a puff of his pipe.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's a Sherlock Holmes pipe, but it's full of meth.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The conceit is this, young people.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 This is his question he posted on Reddit.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 You think that the voices in my head are just a hallucination, right?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 That is what your scientific people have told you,

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 also known as scientists?

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They've told you this, right?

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 But I posit that the, this guy actually

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 pronounces words better than I do.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I posit this theory that may become a conundrum for you.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Takes another hit of his pipe.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 If the voices in my head are not psychic,

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 then how do they know what I'm thinking?

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Hmm?

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 His question really is, how do the voices in my head know what to say

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 if they're not psychic, if they're not from some sort of external force?

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Now, us meth skeptics understand that a hallucinating person,

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 he actually refers to himself, I've never heard this term,

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I don't know if this is a politically correct term,

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 but he refers to himself as a voice experiencing individual.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Oh, no, no, no, I'm not delusional.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I'm a shadow man-seeing American.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So apparently that might be the correct way to talk about people

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 who are in the midst of meth psychosis.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So anyways, how do the voices know what to say to him if they're not psychic?

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Now, we would go, well, because they're your voices, dude.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Like, that'd be like me going like, hey, that's weird

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 whenever I imagine something I see in my head,

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 but how does my head know to project what I'm imagining?

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Well, it's because you're doing it.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And that would be in any other forum, people would go, well, that.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But we're not on any other forum, we're on the subreddit for meth.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Here is a quote from the esteemed philosopher Lil Suicide Note.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Lil Suicide Note had this to say, "As soon as I start hearing stuff,

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I just pop a zan and they shut the f up."

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So yes, yes, as soon as the voice is in your head up here,

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 just take more drugs, take a zan,

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 which is, I'm assuming not zantac, I'm assuming it's not for their heartburn.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Xanax, theological thing, it would be awesome though

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 if you were a voice experiencing individual, you could just go and take some zantac.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Not only would it quell the shadow man shouting at you to get a facial tattoo,

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 it would also cure that Taco Bell you ate earlier.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So Lil Suicide Note says that and also came up with this great tip.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 The voice is in your head, right? The voice is in your head.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Lil Suicide Note, Lil Suicide Note Esquire said this,

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 "By the way, many voices can be people outside."

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So basically, sometimes you might think you're hearing voices in your head going like,

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 "Hey Billy, throw the ball!"

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 "Oh dude, that was such an awesome hit with that baseball bat."

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 "Oh yeah, home run."

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And you're like, "Oh, my voice is in my head, why are they doing this little league game?"

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 It's actually, you might not have known this,

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 but sometimes when you hear stuff, it's not in your head.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It's not in your head, it comes from outside, it comes from stimulus,

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 it comes from sound waves vibrating against your eardrums.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Who would have thought? Who would have thought that?

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Thank you, Lil Suicide Note.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 "By the way, many voices can be people outside that your brain thinks come from your imagination."

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 So if you hear voices, just go asleep.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 That's a good tip from Lil Suicide Note.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 However, if somebody, I've never heard voices in my head, right?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 If you've never heard that, I'm not a voice experiencing individual.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But I would imagine, we've done stories about people hearing voices in their head,

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and they always say they could tell it was in their head.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I would imagine if I did hear voices in my head,

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I wouldn't get it confused with any other, like,

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I would assume if I was hearing voices in my head,

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 that I wouldn't get it confused with just normal conversations going on outside.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I don't know if voice experiencing Americans have to deal with them going like,

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 "Why do I keep hearing this really loud Carnival Barker telling people to step on up?"

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And they're like walking by the state fair, and they're like,

180
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 "Oh, my hallucinations, it sounds like 10,000 people in my head at once."

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I think you can tell the difference, but again, I'm not a voice experiencing individual.

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Secondly, that's not a good tip either.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 If you hear voices, just go to sleep.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Don't go to sleep because the voices may be going,

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 "Dude, dude, your house is on fire."

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Oh, no, and you're like, "Oh, hallucinations.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 No, you're not going to fool me this time.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I'm just going to pop this Xanax and go to sleep."

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 So, voices on outside head may be good, unless you're telling you to like, you know,

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 like, "Stick them up because you're in the 1920s gangster movie.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Stick them up, wise guy.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Maybe listen to those guys, probably should,

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 because they're going to like shoot you with a Tommy gun if you don't."

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 If voices in your head probably don't listen to those,

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 then we have this guy named Miro Man.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 He said, this is very, very clever,

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 "I don't hear anything," is what he said.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 "I see writing and images on textured surfaces and faces and clouds."

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And he shows a bunch of photos.

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 There are a bunch of pictures you can go online to look at pictures of gnomes.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 You remember David the Gnome?

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Or just a gnome in general, a little pointy hat and little face.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Did you know that sometimes a cloud can look like a dude with a beard?

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's like, "Clouds are the most beard-like things in existence anyways,

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 outside of actual beards."

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Anyways, you can find photos.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 This guy's posting them.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Hundreds of them, he says.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I only looked at one of them, but gnomes in clouds.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 You know, it looks like a gnome.

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I'm not going to lie, it looks like a face with a beard.

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 But anyways, he says, "He doesn't hear voices.

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He sees writings and images on textured surfaces and faces and clouds."

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And then he goes on to explain,

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 "It seems like a guardian spirit writing to me."

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 These messages aren't just random, it's a guardian spirit reaching out to him.

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He says, "It feels like a guardian spirit writing to me.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It's telling me to quit meth."

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 That would actually be quite the conundrum, right?

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Because what if you need meth to communicate with your guardian angel,

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 but your guardian angel is telling you to stop doing meth?

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Like, that actually would be an issue.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I've said, yes, I've said the word conundrum twice in one episode.

224
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 That's a good idea for all you writers out there.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 A man who can contact the supernatural and use that information for good.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Or bad.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 It's up to you. I'm not going to write your book for you. That's your job.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 But he has to do meth to do it.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Like, every time he tokes on meth, his guardian angel shows up,

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 and he's like, "Dude, dude, dude, stop taking meth also.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Here's the winning lottery numbers."

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So he would have to make a decision,

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 "Does he keep smoking meth? Does he keep smoking meth?"

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And win the lottery, or does he not smoke meth and not win the lottery?

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 There you go. That's the dilemma.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Do you call that the hero's journey?

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 That's-- there you go. I've just written your book for you.

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 They actually-- that actually used to be the thing with spawn.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It used to be, every time spawn used his superpowers,

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 he got weaker, and eventually he'd use so many of his superpowers

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 he'd get dragged into hell.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 You're like, "Jason, what the hell are you talking about?"

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What? That was a weird segue.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I always thought that was an interesting thing,

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 and then eventually they just go, "Oh, no, that's not going to happen."

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And then you could use his powers all the time.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Same thing in Star Trek Voyager.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Originally, they were like, "Voyager,

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 you only have 70 torpedoes this whole mission."

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And then half-- it wasn't like everything in the first episode.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 They're like, "Oh, we found more. Here you go.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Here's unlimited torpedoes.

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I think the idea of limitations is good."

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 But, Cyan, let's go ahead and we're leaving behind Stockton, California.

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 We are headed out to Crisfield, Maryland.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 [imitates helicopter flying away]

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Helicopter's flying away.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Half of it's missing.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It's being pawned off at some shop.

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Hey, look at this. I found an official part of the Dead Rabbit copter.

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Whatever it's called. I don't-- I don't--

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 They're selling off parts, but we don't care, right?

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We can rebuild it.

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I hope that's the fuel-- they took our fuel line.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 So, Cyan, we now have the carbon helicopter on the back of a tow truck.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Tow truck is driving us.

268
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 We're leaving behind halfway between Stockton and Crisfield, Maryland.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 We're going to get to Crisfield, Maryland.

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 We've got to have some repairs done on the carbon helicopter.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And while we're here, we're going to sit.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 We're going to watch a baseball game of the Crisfield Crabbers.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 [cluck]

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 [whoosh]

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 That's the sound of a bat hitting the ball.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It's not just me saying the word "cluck."

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We're watching a game of the Crisfield Crabbers,

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 eating some hot dogs, popcorn, what have you.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And also sitting on the stands is Kent Allard.

280
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Kent actually sent me the story.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And if you'll remember, Kent Allard sent me--

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 The last time we went to Crisfield was the story about the man and the cabin.

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It was a really good episode.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So thank you, Kent, for this submission.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Tips is a little baseball cap to us.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Crisfield Crabbers, go home team.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 We're sitting here, and now everything's sepia-toned.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 We're going back to the year 1923.

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 It's March 3rd.

290
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And this was reported in the Crisfield Times, which was a newspaper back then.

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 So this story was reported in the Crisfield Times in 1923.

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I don't have a time for when this story actually took place,

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 what year this actually took place.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But it was reported in 1923.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But we're imagining like old timey Crisfield.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 It was a simpler time back then.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 People just went about their business as opposed to day.

298
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Everyone's a busybody.

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Everyone's looking in each other's windows.

300
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 So we're walking through the sepia-toned city.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And in the city, we're going to meet a man named Webb White.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He's the local weirdo, right?

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 He's the guy that everyone in town goes, "Oh, great.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Here comes Webb White."

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 He's local weirdo.

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 He lives with his wife on the outskirts of town.

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Now, he's a weirdo.

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He probably comes off as a conspiracy theorist believer of the paranormal.

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 What would be a conspiracy theorist in 1923?

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 They're like, "You know the Mayflower really didn't land in Plymouth.

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It landed in the Florida Everglades."

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Like, how would you be a conspiracy theorist when...

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Like, what would you...

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 King George still runs the United States.

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Like, I wonder...

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 There had to be conspiracy theorists.

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Like, that's not a new thing.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But I wonder how they...what they were.

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And it's funny because they really want to get disseminated.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 If you were a conspiracy theorist in your town,

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 it's not like you were printing up leaflets.

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 You would just tell everyone in town,

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 you're like, "Well, you know that Roanoke wasn't inside job."

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 People are like, "What?"

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And then once you died out, it would be gone.

326
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You wouldn't be able to leave any record of your crazy conspiracy theories.

327
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Unlike today, because of Angel Fire,

328
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 everyone's conspiracy theory lasts forever.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But he was a local weirdo,

330
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and he believed in the paranormal and stuff like that.

331
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And again, in America, we had a big spiritualism revival.

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 America's always been a fairly paranormal believing country.

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Actually, I should do an episode on that,

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 because Americans in general tend to really believe in the paranormal.

335
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 In Europe and stuff, they believed in witches and devils and stuff like that.

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 You had a lot of Catholic influence and pagan influence and stuff like that.

337
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Sure, but eventually they're like,

338
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 "Well, we don't believe in that anymore."

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But Americans would really get into the spiritualism like turn of the century.

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But even for that place in that period of time,

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 people thought this dude was a weirdo.

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And some guy, against all of judgment, thinks,

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 "You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna pull a prank.

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I'm gonna pull a prank on the one guy in town

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 who's crazy enough to actually do something about it."

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 So basically, old-timey Jake Paul walks up to Web White and goes,

347
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 "Hey, dude, come here, come here.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Come here. He has his pilgrim clothes on."

349
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The caller's all popped and the shirt's too tight.

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And he's like, "Hey, Web, come here, come here.

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I got this hilarious thing to-- I mean, not hilarious.

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I have this totally true thing to tell you, Web.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Come here, come here, come here.

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 You know your neighbor? He's like, "Yeah, well, you don't let me finish.

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You don't let me finish."

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Did you know your neighbor's wife is actually a witch?

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Now, that is dangerous to say to someone who's mentally imbalanced.

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Even today, right, that could obviously cause some problems.

359
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I don't know if this old-timey Jake Paul realized what he was doing.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Maybe he did and he's just a psychopath.

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But Web White actually believes that witches exist and stuff like that.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He totally would have been a fan of this show.

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And he runs home and he's like, "Oh, my neighbor's wife is a witch.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I have to kill her."

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 See, that's not the funny part of the prank, right?

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 That's where the priest says that as he's leaving.

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's running away from Jake Paul.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He's like, "Oh, I got to go do something."

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Jake Paul's laughing and he hears him as he's running off.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 He's like, "I got to do something.

371
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I got to load my gun up and I got to kill."

372
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And Jake Paul's like, "Uh-oh.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Maybe the joke went too far."

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 "Ah, that's okay. I got to go lift weights."

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So he goes, "Lift old-timey weights."

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 They're just hay bales.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Web White goes home and he knows an old-timey way to kill a witch.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I'd actually never heard of this before.

379
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 This might work.

380
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I'm not recommending it.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 But apparently, if you take a picture of a witch and you shoot it with silver,

382
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 wherever the witch is hit, the witch will suffer a wound.

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So, I mean, I don't have to break it down for you.

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Obviously, if it gets shot in the hand,

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 "Oh, my hand hurts."

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It gets writer's cramp using that feather to write letters.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 "Oh, my hand cramp."

388
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Shooting on the heart of the head, it will kill the witch.

389
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Shoot the picture in the heart of the head, it will kill the witch.

390
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Sounds legit.

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 That might actually be...

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I don't know if this guy's just super crazy

393
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 or that might actually be an old-world way of getting rid of a witch.

394
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But there's one problem with this, right?

395
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 You need a picture of the witch.

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You can't whip out your cell phone and take a picture of her gardening, right?

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 You can't even have a Polaroid and take it and you're shaking it.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 You just draw a picture of this woman.

399
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So now we're getting all sorts of complicated stuff, right?

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Because unless your artist skills are on point,

401
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 because you could draw a picture of this woman

402
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 and then shoot it, and then nothing happens.

403
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And then, like, 50 miles away, there's a woman who looks exactly like the drawing.

404
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 She's like a two-dimensional, her hair's all scraggly.

405
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 She wears a dress that looks like a triangle

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 and all of a sudden she just blows up in her kitchen.

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Like, it's really hard to draw a picture of someone that is so representative of them.

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And if you shot it, they'd die.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Pablo Picasso's like shooting in his drawings.

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Aliens are blowing up on some weird planet.

411
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 He draws a picture of the switch.

412
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So I don't know if it was like a sketch.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I don't know if it was this super detailed Bob Ross-style painting.

414
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's all like watercolors and layers, stuff like that.

415
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But he draws a picture of the switch, because what else is he going to do?

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 He then takes 10 silver dimes and sticks them in a musket.

417
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 This guy, at the very least, is ingenious.

418
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Insane! Totally insane.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But he takes 10 silver dimes, he puts them in a musket.

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He hangs the picture up on the outside of his woodhouse,

421
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 which is exactly what you think it is.

422
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's a house full of wood.

423
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He puts it up on his outside of his woodhouse,

424
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 and he takes his musket, and he aims it at the picture,

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 and goes...

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So he shoots it, and the 10 dimes shoot out,

427
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and it peppers the picture.

428
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And then he hears...

429
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 [Screaming]

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Screaming. Screaming if you didn't know what that was.

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The picture wasn't having an orgasm.

432
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He hears the sound of a woman screaming,

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and he goes, "Gadzooks! I got her!"

434
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And runs off into his neighbor's house.

435
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He wants to see what he's actually done to this witch.

436
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 She's not a woman, she's a witch.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 She did nothing wrong to a woman.

438
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Remember, someone just came up and said,

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 "I think she's a witch."

440
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And then he decided to murder her via picture.

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 He breaks into their house,

442
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 and what he finds is a woman in the kitchen screaming,

443
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 and nothing else.

444
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 She's totally fine. She's not obliterated.

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 She has all of her extremities.

446
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Her face is totally fine, except for the very loud noises

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 coming out of her mouth.

448
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And the neighbor jumps up, the husband of the screaming woman,

449
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 and was like, "Web, what are you doing in my house?

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What are you doing?"

451
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And now, remember, here's the thing.

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 These two people were just sitting there,

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 having a nice quiet evening,

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 casting spells against the non-believers.

455
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 No, they're just doing normal stuff.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

457
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

458
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

461
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

462
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

464
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

465
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

466
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

467
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

468
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 They're just doing normal stuff.

470
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 So they just leaned their head out the window and went, "Cops! Cops!"

471
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And then the cop showed up.

472
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 So he's being a lead away in handcuffs.

473
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He's like, "Oh, no, but I swear, I shot the picture and I heard a scream.

474
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That could have never happened if it wasn't a witch."

475
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And that is when we find out how this whole mystery unfolded.

476
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So let's go back in time.

477
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 We rewind this.

478
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 He has the picture lined up and he's taking the shot.

479
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He doesn't know it, but his own wife is in the woodhouse,

480
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 collecting wood.

481
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 She has no idea what's going on outside of her shed.

482
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 But then she hears a gunshot, super close to her,

483
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and she swears someone's shooting at her.

484
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 We've talked a lot about hearing voices this episode.

485
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Man with a gun.

486
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 There's a picture on a wall.

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 On the other side of the wall is a woman.

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So when he shoots the picture and doesn't know there's anyone in the room

489
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and hears the woman scream, he thinks it's the witch.

490
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 He thinks he's killed the witch.

491
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But it turns out that it was really just his way.

492
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 He really just shot at his poor wife.

493
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 For the most part, he got arrested for breach of peace,

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 is kind of what it was charged for.

495
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 He didn't get arrested for attempted murder of a witch.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 He didn't get arrested for shooting a drawing after 6 p.m.,

497
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 which is against the law in Christfield, Maryland.

498
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He didn't get -- it's just basically like breach of peace.

499
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But they said in this article that when he broke into the house

500
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 and he saw that the woman was okay, he flipped out.

501
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Imagine being disappointed that someone didn't --

502
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 someone didn't disintegrate from your magic spell.

503
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You think he heard that it.

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 He ran inside the room, kicks in the door,

505
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 and sees that a woman is not a puddle of goo

506
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 full of, you know, silver dimes and stuff.

507
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Like, "That's just a woman holding a turkey."

508
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 She just pulled out of the oven.

509
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Did they have ovens back then?

510
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "Holding a turkey." She just pulled off the fireplace.

511
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So part of the breach of peace, one,

512
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I don't think it was against a lot of fire muskets.

513
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Kicking in someone else's door, screaming that they're not disintegrated.

514
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You probably get to charge for that, right?

515
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 We don't know what happened to any of these characters.

516
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 We don't know what happened to Time Traveling and Jake Paul.

517
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What we do, now he's in our era, causing chaos.

518
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 That's why the feds arrested him the other day.

519
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He had drawings of all these witches around.

520
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 He's like, "If it worked back then..."

521
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Wait, it didn't work back then.

522
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 He totally failed.

523
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He takes them all down, and the feds just arrest him anyways.

524
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Allegedly.

525
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But anyways, we don't know what happened to Webb White.

526
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 We don't know what happened to his wife.

527
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 His wife probably got said, "No more shooting at me.

528
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Webb, I know you're crazy, but you crossed the line

529
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 when you opened fire and that shed I was in."

530
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 He's like, "Oh."

531
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 We don't know what happened.

532
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 He probably went...

533
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 This would really solidify his...

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 If he was trying to get rid of that town weirdo vibe he was giving,

535
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 this wouldn't help.

536
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But a small town story featuring

537
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 a Jake Paul, I bet you didn't expect that.

538
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 A crazy man and a woman accused of witchcraft.

539
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Out of all this stuff, I think the most compelling thing

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 is that idea of if you shoot a picture of a witch

541
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 with silver, it'll damage them.

542
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So let that be a warning to all of you out there

543
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 who practice the dark arts.

544
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And look like a cartoon character that's easily drawn.

545
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 You may think you're getting away with casting spells

546
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 and eating frogs or whatever you do.

547
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Dark, evil witches of the world.

548
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 You may think you're getting away with it.

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But someday, some kid at school may be drawing a picture.

550
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He's drawing a picture and it's just a picture of a witch.

551
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 But it looks like you.

552
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And then he goes, "Hey, Bobby, can I borrow that silver-colored crown?"

553
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And the guy's like, "You mean a crayon?"

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He's like, "Whatever, just give me your silver-colored crown."

555
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 So he takes out the silver-colored crown

556
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 and he's like, "Drawn on the witch stuff?"

557
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He's like, "Drawn more on the witch."

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And you, you're in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 you're washing your dishes that you just used.

560
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 This was your nice china you used when you summoned the dark lord

561
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and you're like, "Oh, that was such a nice visit from him.

562
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Now it's time to do my dishes."

563
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And you feel your arms start to itch.

564
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And you're like, "What? Oh, that's weird."

565
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 But you don't really think anything of it.

566
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 You don't know about this old world remedy for witchcraft.

567
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And so then this kid is like, "Oh, okay, I'm done drawing the arm.

568
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Hey, Tony, do you still have that silver marker that actually has silver in it?

569
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 It's like, "You can cost your dad a thousand dollars?

570
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Can I borrow that?"

571
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

572
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It actually has silver flakes in it.

573
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And he's drawing on the drawing,

574
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 but it's like on the face.

575
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And now you're back in Albuquerque and you're trying to watch an episode.

576
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 What show do witches watch?

577
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 You're trying to watch episode of Gilmore Girls,

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 because I swear to God, the only reason that show last time on the air

579
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 was some sort of black magic.

580
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 That show was insufferable.

581
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 This witch is watching Gilmore Girls.

582
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 She's like casting a spell.

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 She's like, "Stay on the air. Have a reunion show."

584
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And then her face starts itching.

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 "Oh, what? What?

586
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 This is the worst thing that's happened to me.

587
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 My arm itches and now my face itches.

588
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Ugh.

589
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Oh, it's where my face is itching."

590
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And then we flash back to Lil' Boy and he's like,

591
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 "Hmm, I've used a silver..."

592
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I have a silver finish apparently.

593
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I've used silver crayon and I've used a silver marker.

594
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But this is boring.

595
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I've decided to draw like a rocket ship or something else.

596
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So he crumbles the paper up and then he like was walking down the street.

597
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He used the paper the whole time.

598
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He has this thing.

599
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 He can't let go of things.

600
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And then he sees like,

601
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "There's a river.

602
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 There's a river of molten silver.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He's in Silver Town, Nevada."

604
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And he throws the paper into the silver river.

605
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And then we go back to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And her spell was successful.

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Gilmore Girls was renewed for another 40 seasons.

608
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 The plague is upon us.

609
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 The fourth seal has been opened.

610
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But while she's laying in bed,

611
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 she starts itching again.

612
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Which again isn't the worst thing.

613
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Just pop a Benadryl.

614
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And she starts itching again.

615
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 She's like, "Ugh!"

616
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And then her bed catches on fire.

617
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And she dies.

618
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Obviously, right?

619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 That's more than an itch.

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 "Witches of the world beware.

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 We know the only reason Gilmore Girls exist is because of you.

622
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And we now know your weakness.

623
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 A drawing, a simple drawing of a witch.

624
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Infused with silver.

625
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Can stop your evil deeds."

626
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So, "Witches of the world beware."

627
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 If you continue to practice your dark arts and curse this land.

628
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Some people look up at the clouds and they see gnomes floating around.

629
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Some people look up at the clouds and they see...

630
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 They don't see gnomes.

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 They just see normal clouds.

632
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 But witches, I want you to look up and look at those clouds.

633
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And you see, "Hmm, that's weird.

634
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 That cloud's awfully gray.

635
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And it's coming right at me.

636
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 It's coming right at me."

637
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And you know why it's coming...

638
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 You know why it's coming right at you?

639
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Because that cloud has a silver lining.

640
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So it's gonna get him?

641
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 'Cause the silver thing?

642
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And hope!

643
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 It plays in the whole thing.

644
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Every cloud has a silver lining.

645
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Except for witches.

646
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 They don't count.

647
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 They become drawings in melt and silver.

648
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
