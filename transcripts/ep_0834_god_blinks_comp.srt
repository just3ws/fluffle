1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 What would it take for you to drive down three-legged lady road?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:13,280
 And then we travel back to the Renaissance to take a look at the story of when a very famous philosopher comes face-to-face

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,800
 with ascended alien masters today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having lots of fun

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,440
 staying warm or cold depending on what environment you're in. It's freezing up here. Before we get started

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,420
 Let's go ahead and welcome in one of our Thanksgiving livestream

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:51,560
 Donators coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. Give it up for Alison's Wake. Woo! Come on in. Yeah, Alison's been waiting a long time for you

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,640
 That's not that that's actually true. Alison's Wake when they made the donation. They said please don't put me on any gross episodes

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
 So it's taking a while. It's taking a while. This episode should not be disgusting

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,000
 I'm sorry you pervo out there who was hoping it was another one of my disgusting episodes

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,720
 There's not many but I think for the people who don't like them one is too many

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,920
 But Alison's Wake you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the show financially

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,160
 I totally get it trust me. Just help spread the word about the show. Tell your friends. Tell your family

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,200
 We got flyers you can print out in the show notes post them up around town

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
 Anything you can do to get the word out really really helps out a lot really does

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,040
 Alison I want to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,360
 We're gonna glide out of Dead Rabbit Command for our first story. We're headed all the way out to Mississippi

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,720
 Before we get started I want to say this real quickly. I'm currently recording this episode. I'm freezing

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,480
 I got my neighbors televisions blaring really loud and other neighbors working on the car out in the garage

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,720
 You know, they're good people. I really like my neighbors, but the reason why I'm telling you guys that

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,360
 excuses for the poor audio quality

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,320
 I'm telling you I know a lot of you guys are like me a lot of you guys have projects that you want to do the time will

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,060
 Never be a hundred percent right for you to get started on that project start it start it now

25
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,060
 Start it now. It really really will change your life

26
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,020
 This show has changed my life and I things weren't perfect when I started it

27
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,100
 I had three jobs. I worked seven days a week and now I was able to quit two of my jobs because of the money

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,900
 I make from this podcast so I mean you just get started when you can and like tonight

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,060
 I could wait till tomorrow or whatever to record this episode put it off

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,500
 No, I can't right. I got to do it now. I've learned to just do it now

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,640
 So sorry for sometimes poor audio quality, but guys it will never be perfect start your project now

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,220
 If you're waiting for the right time, you'll never get started

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,800
 The little PSA I get to write this episode office attacks deduction now that he said that now I'm joking

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,740
 I really do mean that Allison glide us on down here into Mississippi specifically. We're headed to a road Nash Road

35
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,360
 Which is outside of Columbus, Mississippi. This is a like a rural road

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,540
 I mean it's paved and everything like that. It's not made for goats and covered wagons

37
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,180
 It's a regular road, but it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. There's lots of trees everywhere. It looks like a pleasant drive

38
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,980
 during the day, but

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,300
 We're here obviously for here in a paranormal true crime of conspiracy by the guys. It's not a pleasant road all the time

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:43,500
 This road is Nash Road legally that is how the government recognizes it, but locals call it by a different name

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,280
 three

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
 Legged Lady Road

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,580
 That might be that would be the most descriptive term for this legend

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,540
 It's interesting. This is one of those urban legends that crosses over into a possible haunting. What's true?

45
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,100
 What's not we're gonna take a look at all this stuff three legged lady road though leaves very little to the imagination

46
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,460
 It involves a three legged lady

47
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,760
 But which three legged lady is the question?

48
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,920
 There's more than one there's more than one for this phantom on this road so apparently according to locals

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,600
 I'm sure they get into very loud arguments at the local tavern over this some people say this place is called three legged lady road

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,640
 because of the story of Rose a

51
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,440
 Long time ago. There was a young beautiful girl named Rose and she lived in the area

52
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,800
 She had two legs. She had two legs at this point and she's just growing up and experiencing all the wonders of

53
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,820
 Columbus, Mississippi all the great sights and sounds of this place

54
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,980
 But unfortunately, there is a group of Satan worshipers also in Columbus, Mississippi

55
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,420
 So a group of Satan worshipers are living in Columbus, Mississippi

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,380
 It doesn't say exactly where they live

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,180
 I wonder if they just rented out a townhouse and all of them were like roomies together

58
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,100
 But whether we don't know what they're living arrangements for but we know what their deading

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,980
 arrangements were because they like to kill people the Satan worshipers grabbed Rose and they wanted to use her for a

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,300
 Satanic ceremony so they took her out to Nash Road and

61
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,180
 During the ceremony they chopped her up

62
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,740
 well, what happens is

63
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,300
 Roses mom realizes Rose isn't home and she starts to worry about her and she's like oh

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,660
 Just being a worry wart, but I hope all of her limbs are still attached

65
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,560
 So she begins to kind of drive around looking for Rose and apparently law enforcement gets involved at some point

66
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 this becomes a missing persons case and

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:49,560
 Whether or not the Satan worshipers have infiltrated the local police department, you notice that all the cops also live in the same townhouse

68
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,800
 We don't know we don't know the specifics of that really what we know is that Rose had no luck in finding

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,680
 Her daughter until one day she was driving down Nash Road and she found

70
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,300
 Her daughter's leg sitting on the side of the road

71
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
 not very

72
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,340
 Worshippers if they can't clean up after themselves

73
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,020
 Apparently she found her daughter's leg and that was the only piece of her daughter that she found

74
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,420
 And I don't know again like if the cops were corrupt or people didn't believe her

75
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,420
 I mean it's one thing to say my daughter's missing them for the police to go

76
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,540
 Ah, she probably just ran away

77
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,260
 It's another thing to show up at the police department with your daughter's severed leg and be like

78
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,000
 This is my daughter's leg and them to be like oh, maybe she ran away. Maybe she hopped away

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,840
 We don't know and then not investigating it, but apparently

80
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,840
 Rose was executed by Saint-Worshippers. She was chopped up mom finds the leg into this day

81
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,800
 If you drive down three-legged lady road you may see a grieving mother carrying her daughter's severed leg

82
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,600
 walking through the darkness saw being silently

83
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,820
 Hoping that someday she can finally find the rest of her daughter and save her soul from Satan's grasp

84
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,300
 That's a pretty good story right urban legend goes. That's a pretty good urban legend. However

85
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,460
 Is it this is where you become a philosopher if a woman with two legs carries a leg

86
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,740
 Would you ever call her three-legged lady?

87
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,980
 Or would you call her nor normal grieving mother with the severed leg of her daughter road?

88
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,720
 So there's actually another version of this that is more grammatically correct

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
 Apparently in this area there is the action to say apparently this is true

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,880
 You can do Google Earth. I'll have a link of the show notes. You can check it out

91
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,160
 You can drive down this road with the with the camera van or whatever it is if you look at Google Earth at this location

92
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,880
 It does show that this used to be a church like it's actually marked as a church, but when you go to Street View

93
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
 It's just rubble

94
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,780
 So I think Google Earth might need to update their descriptions there

95
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,960
 But it is no one at it was no one as a church at one point now

96
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,760
 It's so creepy because I'm sure this place is fairly popular with you know kids and teenagers stuff like that

97
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,220
 There's a yellow

98
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,160
 Lawn chair just sitting there in the middle of nowhere, right? This is really down this forested street

99
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,780
 Road highway, whatever you want to call it road road is what it's legally called

100
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,360
 But you'll see the ruins of a church and there's like a yellow plastic chair sitting there with somebody set up maybe

101
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,640
 Three-legged lady will find out so three-legged lady. This is the more grammatically correct version of the story

102
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
 What happened was

103
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,440
 Before this church became rubble. Let's go back in time where the church was actually a church

104
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,600
 There was a woman and her husband who lived in the area

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,560
 You have a lot of farms in this area and this story

106
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,020
 I think is supposed to be implied to take place sometime in the like 1950s or something like that. You have this woman

107
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
 We're gonna call her Margaret

108
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,180
 Margaret is married to Sam and they are deeply in love Margaret every day

109
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,200
 Just loves waking up next to Sam and being like what a beautiful morning. I got both

110
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,880
 I got both my legs just checking and Sam is such a hard-working guy so handsome. I love this guy and her love for him was so deep

111
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,940
 that

112
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:20,280
 It could complicate things in the future right sometimes someone can love you too much that you think hmm if I ever cheat on this person

113
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,600
 Dozens of people may die

114
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:31,920
 But Sam doesn't get that get that little recognition in his noggin because he does cheat on her and apparently he cheats on her a lot

115
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,080
 She puts up with it for a while, but he's constantly playing the field literally because they're all farmers and

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,420
 One time she actually just has enough of it

117
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,380
 She can't she can no longer bear the love of her life

118
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,120
 sleeping with other women

119
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,160
 so

120
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
 she kills him and

121
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,780
 After she kills him she decides that I always want a piece of you with me

122
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,720
 So she could have taken an ear right made a necklace like some sort of psychotic soldier

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,680
 She could have made a nice charm bracelet out of his teeth

124
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,740
 You know maybe taking off his nose and kept it in a little music box

125
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,200
 But since this is called three-legged lady road, you know, she didn't take any of those suggestions

126
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
 She actually chopped off his leg and

127
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,960
 Then in a feat of engineering that no one explains in this story. She was able to sew

128
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,400
 His leg onto her

129
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,960
 Hence she truly is a three-legged lady. She's walking around on two legs and then sticking off of her left hip is the rotting

130
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,340
 Leg rotting man's leg. I don't even know like she'd be super unbalanced

131
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,100
 Maybe she'd be like a weevil wobble

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,700
 Maybe as she starts to tip over that left leg would kind of help her probably not

133
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,240
 It's probably super disgusting very smelly and I'm sure she immediately got an infection

134
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,540
 I'm glad I'm talking about this story scientifically as if this is possible in any way she ever formed

135
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,200
 So now Margaret has murdered her husband and is walking around with a quickly decaying leg

136
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,900
 So into her and people in town start to get kind of suspicious

137
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,240
 they start to think hey, it's weird no one's seen Sam lately and

138
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,520
 Then it's weird that his wife has an extra leg

139
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,360
 Maybe we should put two and two together and some people did at the local church

140
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,740
 The aforementioned ruins when it was a real church the people there started to really start to think something was up again

141
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,880
 Because guys missing woman has a new leg. It smells like rotting flesh and she's very coy about the whole thing

142
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,520
 She's go what this oh, no, I was born with this. I had this the whole time Mandela effect

143
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,940
 What the world's Mandela effect? Who's Mandela? Anyways

144
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,380
 The church people say you know what Margaret? We're gonna turn you in we actually think you murdered your husband

145
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,520
 You weren't born with the third leg

146
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,320
 We're actually going to turn you in the church people all decided to turn her in but first

147
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 Let's go church

148
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
 This was all on a Sunday morning

149
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,560
 They converged on her house and they said we're gonna turn you in and then the church bell started ringing

150
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 And they're like oh, we'll do it after church

151
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,520
 So all of the people who are accusing her happened to go to this church and

152
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:21,040
 As she watched them go into the building she goes aha the perfect plan as everyone who knows my crime is in that building

153
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,720
 I'm gonna barricade the door shut and I'm gonna burn the church down

154
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,120
 And she did the pretty easy plan right she seems to be batting a thousand at this point

155
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,280
 She burns the church down and everybody dies all of them die

156
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,440
 So that's kind of the end of that story

157
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,920
 There's no part where like the police surround the house and they're like come out with your legs up

158
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,860
 And she's like you'll never take me alive covers

159
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,720
 She's like shooting at him and stuff like that or you know just regular legal stuff like her getting arrested in standing trial

160
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,640
 And they're like we're gonna have to take that leg off as evidence and she's like no I was born with this

161
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,560
 It's a Mandela effect than the judges like what so to this day

162
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,700
 Some people say as you're driving down three-legged lady road

163
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,960
 You may see a literal three-legged lady just walking down the street her body is normal and then a rotting

164
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,600
 Male leg strapped not even strapped stitched into her. She's walking down the street now

165
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
 I'm gonna ask you a couple questions here real quick. What's more terrifying really?

166
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,400
 Driving on the road and seeing a woman walking carrying a leg

167
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,600
 You're like just the only terrifying before you even say the other one or

168
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,360
 Seeing a three-legged lady walk down the road now you could be born with three legs

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,600
 And it could be a like a birth defect so that's not necessarily creepy

170
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 You're not gonna be like and run away from someone

171
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 But if they had three legs because one of them was the leg of a murder victim, right?

172
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,580
 So that's that's that's not a birth defect. That is a mental defect

173
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,500
 The fact that you thought you could get away with it. What would be who would you want living as your roommate is a better thing?

174
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,580
 Because if I say driving on the road, you're just gonna hit the gas pedal and get out of there

175
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,900
 You are renting out your apartment and there's two people if you choose neither one then both of them live with you

176
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,820
 One is a grieving mother who's constantly carrying around her daughter's severed leg

177
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:14,700
 And so like she's like it's your turn to do dishes and she's like setting the leg setting the leg in the sink

178
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,820
 And she's watching the dishes and putting them in the water with this severed leg

179
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,140
 And you're like, uh or your roommate is a homicidal woman with three legs

180
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:28,660
 And it's like this big hairy muscular man leg and she's like sitting on the couch next to you all the time

181
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,500
 She's trying to play footsie with you and toes and skin are falling off. Which one's worse?

182
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,060
 Which one's what? I don't have the answer. I don't know which one would be worse

183
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,060
 I think they'd both be equally terrifying if I had to choose between the two actually I think I would choose the mom

184
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,140
 Right because at least then you can maybe you can maybe hide the leg when she's at work

185
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,860
 You could probably send her a psychiatrist and get her some mental help, but the woman with the three legs

186
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
 She's a killer. So I think that's kind of

187
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,260
 It was kind of a waste of time for me to even pose that question

188
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,300
 Everyone's like Jason if you're asking me who would I rather be with a grieving mother or

189
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,620
 Homicidal maniac. I'm choosing the grieving mother. Anyways, I love this story

190
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,460
 It's so weird and specific like a lot of times we have crybaby bridge and that's where you can hear the sound of children

191
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:22,100
 Crying underneath the bridge. There is a crybaby bridge in almost every country like it's so common because surprise surprise

192
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,740
 When water is running over rocks in the middle of the night it can make weird noises

193
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,180
 It oh, it's so specific

194
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,100
 It makes me feel like there is a ghost here that has three legs whether or not she's carrying one or it's attached to her

195
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,980
 It's such a specific road like we've covered roads

196
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,700
 Maybe it's like Clifton Road and that's the official name of the road and that's

197
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,340
 That's what the name of the ghost hunters call it too

198
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,060
 But that's where you can drive down that road and you'll see like a phantom hitchhiker

199
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,820
 We actually covered one recently about a phantom hitchhiker. It wasn't even called phantom hitchhiker road

200
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,420
 It was just called the road. They didn't even have a name for it. This one is so specific

201
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,460
 Three-legged lady road. That's the term that local superstitious people ghost hunters use

202
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,020
 So why would you have such a specific name if you hadn't seen that phantom there?

203
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,620
 Because a lot of I figured originally it was an urban legend set up because there's a burnt-down church

204
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,500
 And then a big brother was like well, you know why that church was burned down. No

205
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,060
 Well, let me tell you this totally creepy story that's gonna disturb and ruin your childhood

206
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:29,020
 But this is so specific. It's weird all of the urban legends revolve around a one

207
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,700
 I just told you two of them. There's other origin stories, but

208
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,520
 Revolve around a woman with three legs. What if it's an urban legend did someone come up with the name first and then

209
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,140
 Backwrite the urban legend was there an actual phantom scene there at some point that was

210
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,660
 Distorted in some way and looked like it had three legs

211
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,560
 So it slowly got the name three-legged lady road

212
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,260
 Is there any historical truth to any of these stories?

213
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,780
 Out of all of them

214
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,740
 I think the most realistic one is the mom carrying the severed leg of her daughter, right?

215
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,300
 And it could have not even been a satanic worshiping thing

216
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,340
 It could have been like a car accident or something like that just this horrible real-life tragedy that became an urban legend

217
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,740
 Who knows super mysterious? I mean, I guess you can go find out when your new roommate comes knocking

218
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,420
 I'm here to check out the new bedroom as they're walking in with a severed leg

219
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,420
 Allison's wake let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind

220
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,260
 This listeners apartment now, but it smells like decaying flesh. We are headed all the way out too

221
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,860
 As we're headed out there

222
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:40,600
 I want to do a really quick dead rabbit recommends for this movie that I absolutely love and I could go on and on talking about it

223
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,660
 But I'm not going to because I got to keep it quick. I saw this movie just recently

224
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,380
 It's directed by a guy who does like asylum films. He used to do like playboy videos

225
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,840
 This movie is neither of those things. This is actually one of the most clever movies. I've seen in a long time

226
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,440
 It's called the man from earth and it's directed by Richard Schneckman. It's a

227
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,960
 Dialogue movie you may call it a you may call it a drama

228
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,140
 I'm a big action guy like explosions. I like sci-fi like horror and this movie is

229
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,100
 sci-fi I guess but it takes place in a cabin not a cabin in the woods

230
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,060
 Not like a spooky it like a cabin that people are living in and the setup is this this college professor is

231
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,220
 Leaving he's decided to quit his job as a college professor

232
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,880
 He'd been working there for the past couple years and he's gonna move on and he invites a bunch of his friends over

233
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,820
 For actually he doesn't invite him over they crash

234
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,680
 They show up at his house because they're like hey, we heard you were leaving and you didn't tell us why?

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,220
 And the guy his name is John. He says well, you know, I don't normally tell anyone this but

236
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,940
 I'm 50,000 years old and

237
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,180
 The movie is this brilliant

238
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:03,380
 Set piece this brilliant play of words between him

239
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,820
 Trying to convince them that he is 50,000 years old

240
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,900
 But he doesn't really even care if they believe him and them constantly asking him questions

241
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,180
 And it's laid out so perfectly. I'm a big action movie fan and the conversations were like fight scenes

242
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:27,120
 Like you would feel the like a particular conversation start to culminate and then it would hit the climax

243
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,300
 And then you would have that denoment and then someone else would ask a different question and you would feel the dialogue

244
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 Beautifully written film beautifully acted film

245
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:45,100
 It's so weird. It's such an interesting film dead rabbit recommends the man from earth. They made a sequel. I haven't seen it yet

246
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
 I heard it's not very good

247
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,820
 But the man from earth is definitely like one of the best movies I've seen this year hands down the man from earth dead rabbit recommends

248
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,860
 the man from earth I

249
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,860
 Like how Allison's wake I just realized this has not to be on a gross episode and I just spent what 15 20 minutes talking about

250
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,220
 Severed legs rotting slowly, but Allison's wake. Let's go ahead and land this carboner copter here

251
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,100
 We are currently in Milan, Italy. It's August 13th 1491

252
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:22,480
 This is actually a really good segue from that the man from earth movie recommendation because this is kind of the same

253
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
 But apparently this is a true story

254
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,540
 It was a summer evening in Milan, Italy on August 13th 1491 and

255
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,100
 Fosio Cardano is sitting at his home now Fosio

256
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,860
 was a philosopher a mathematician he was a professor and

257
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,700
 He studied the occult

258
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,460
 So if anyone was going to meet

259
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,180
 aliens

260
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,660
 This is the guy. I'm not discounting everyone else who's had an alien story, but they always say like

261
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,220
 We should have brought a poet up to space like all these technicians have gone up there all of these highly trained

262
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,460
 Astronauts have gone up there, but if you could take a poet who can actually express in such beautiful language

263
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,620
 What it's like to leave the planet like we should have brought a poet an old saying

264
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,780
 Fosio is that guy which

265
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,900
 For sure and pronounce it his name wrong walk a walk a walk a

266
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:24,580
 Fosio is there. He was a personal friend of Leonardo DiCaprio not him. He was a personal friend

267
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,620
 Totally different story that does involve time travel

268
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,060
 He was a personal friend of Leonardo da Vinci. So this guy ran with a good crew, right?

269
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,020
 He wasn't a slacker on August 13th though. He was just chilling at his home

270
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,540
 He had a long day of philosophizing and he goes I think I'll stay at home tonight and

271
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,940
 Suddenly in his house. He realizes he's no longer alone

272
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,900
 Seven men just appear they just appear out of thin air

273
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,260
 He described him as majestic men

274
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
 these figures

275
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,020
 Inspired awe and him almost immediately

276
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,460
 He said they were wearing bright colored flowing robes with sandals very very functional

277
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,820
 Actually now that I think about it

278
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,100
 How come they weren't wearing like sneakers and stuff because nowadays if you saw an alien they'd be wearing

279
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,580
 Do I know they don't wear sneakers anyways?

280
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,660
 You see any reptilian coming after you and he's wearing Air Jordans

281
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,380
 But you know what I mean like that's interesting. They're dressed in the clothes of the time

282
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:30,020
 I never even thought of this as I was putting these notes together anyways. They're wearing bright flowing robes

283
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,740
 They're wearing sandals and they have on Greek tiaras, which I don't know if that's different than normal tiaras

284
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,500
 I tried looking that up and just got a hundred photos of regular tiaras

285
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,860
 They had black hair

286
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,540
 They all had matching black hair and he described them each of them as just being very beautiful

287
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,820
 Beans wherever they'd come from. They were quite the lookers

288
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,180
 He says they all appear to be 30 to 40 years old

289
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,020
 There's no

290
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,540
 Word saying that they're aliens and they have giant eyes or they look like frogmen or anything like that

291
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,540
 These guys definitely appear to be human and

292
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,340
 They've appeared in front of Fazio

293
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,300
 So let the questions begin

294
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:20,140
 This is one of those stories where the human is just asking questions of these alien beings and we're getting these pretty interesting answers

295
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,940
 He asked, you know, who are you guys? He's picking up his cane. He's about to beat these seven guys

296
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,060
 He broke into his house

297
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,500
 He asked who who are you guys who are you guys and they said that they are men composed of air?

298
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,860
 Whatever that means

299
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,980
 He's asking questions and they're answering them a lot of their answers are weird

300
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,700
 Right, I guess I never expected me to show up and be like oh, I'm from Michigan

301
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,940
 But you know he asked who they are and he goes we're men composed of air

302
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,580
 We are just like you in the sense that we are born and we die

303
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,700
 We do have finite lifespans, but we live to be up to 300 years old

304
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
 Like we can live much longer than the normal human

305
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,980
 That kind of started this

306
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,100
 Conversation they're having

307
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,700
 Fazio says we spoke of philosophy. We spoke of life after death

308
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,340
 Like where does this journey take us?

309
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,660
 and they

310
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,820
 Were very very specific about the transient nature of man's existence on earth

311
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,620
 This is just a moment in time for you. There is life after death

312
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:35,300
 But this physical point between a beginning and yet another beginning

313
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,860
 This is just a little way stop

314
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,180
 An interesting thing that these aliens told Fazio is that

315
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,340
 Nothing singular to a human survives death

316
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:55,300
 So all of your quirks your personality everything that makes you you

317
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,660
 dies

318
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,620
 you survive

319
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,780
 But all of the things that are only part of you

320
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,980
 dies with your physical body

321
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:16,540
 Fascinating right like fascinating is this true and this is true because these beautiful men are telling Fazio this back in the 1400s

322
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,660
 Does it mean more than any philosopher?

323
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:26,500
 Before or sense or science or religion or anything like that who knows but in this in the in this story

324
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,340
 That's just a really really fascinating concept like who I am Jason Carpenter with all my passions and all my faults

325
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:42,680
 Die with me but the soul of me continues on forward because I like my passions and I like my quirks and I even like

326
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,180
 My faults I try to work on them

327
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,420
 But you know even the stuff that I've done that I've messed up doing are part of my experience

328
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:58,940
 So very very fascinating thing and and Fazio says they talked for three hours this company where I'm not gonna read you three hours of questions

329
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,200
 Unfortunately, we don't have three hours of questions now the thing about it

330
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,400
 I would have loved to read you a three hour long conversation between a human and an alien and I'd love to listen to that as well, but

331
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,940
 They talked for three hours and this is this is one of the most interesting concepts

332
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,940
 That I've come across lately. I love this thing. It's both frightening and

333
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,660
 enlightening

334
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,200
 Fazio asks what is the nature of the universe?

335
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,360
 These are big questions we covered a story about a farmer who got fed pancakes by an alien

336
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,880
 Which I'm sure they were pretty funny alien pancakes

337
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,120
 But when you drop a philosopher who studied the occult and who is an introspective and extra

338
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,400
 perspective person

339
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,560
 Gonna have better questions right then can I eat your pancakes?

340
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,400
 Fazio asks what is the origin of the universe and for the first time in three hours?

341
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
 these seven aliens

342
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,700
 disagree

343
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,500
 Apparently most of them were of the belief that God created the universe

344
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,580
 I always find it fascinating when aliens talk about religion

345
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:14,660
 Most of the aliens say well the origin of the universe is that God created the universe, but two of the aliens disagree

346
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,260
 And one of the aliens the tallest of the aliens says that's not true

347
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,420
 God

348
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,540
 Well, it's kind of true, right, but not quite true

349
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,860
 God

350
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,580
 This is dope. This is so awesome. He said God creates the universe

351
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,860
 constantly

352
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,300
 Like what does that mean he goes

353
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,580
 Every minute

354
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,060
 God creates the universe every minute every moment

355
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:55,020
 God is creating the universe and you're going so he's making it bigger is it is expanding? No

356
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 the

357
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,340
 Universe basically blinks out of existence every single moment and God

358
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,500
 reignites that flame

359
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,940
 It's this constant rebooting of a computer in a way and

360
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,420
 That's how we perceive time and movement and things changing

361
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:23,140
 Moment-to-moment God creates the universe from the beginning to the end of that moment

362
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,660
 And then the new moment starts and he recreates the universe from the beginning to this new moment

363
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,540
 It is a constant work

364
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,780
 being built brick by brick

365
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,780
 but each moment the wall is cleared and

366
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,900
 The entire wall must be built once more with another brick added to it and

367
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,180
 if at any moment

368
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,900
 God hesitates

369
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,300
 God stops God blinks

370
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:04,820
 Reality ceases to exist forever

371
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:13,020
 What an interesting way to think of reality

372
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,660
 Let me source this story real quick

373
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,540
 I got this from Albert Rosales humanoid sightings report, which is a resource we go to a lot

374
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:30,140
 He got it from Jacques Valet's passport to Magonia, which is one of the key books in UFO literature

375
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 especially when it talks about the

376
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,820
 Paranormal or extra dimensional origin of alien life Jacques Valet is kind of the

377
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,700
 the

378
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,220
 The progenitor of that theory really he's definitely made it more popular if he didn't

379
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:53,060
 Created himself. I'm more of a Jacques Valet style believing in aliens than thinking they're coming from Alpha Centauri

380
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,020
 I think there's a lot more evidence to say that they're extra dimensional or

381
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,020
 Like that right

382
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:07,580
 But I'm not completely soured on the alien coming from other planet anything so but to source that there this is stories coming from some pretty legit sources

383
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,580
 Fascinating I mean I know I again

384
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:15,140
 I don't think I'm gonna do the story anymore justice if I just drone on and on to be honest

385
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,380
 I did just do ten minutes of just rambling and I edited it all out, but I just love this story

386
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,020
 I wanted to share the story with you. I mean

387
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,580
 Incredibly disturbed by it. You're like, oh great Jason now something else

388
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,380
 I got to worry about God burping one day and then all of us just disappearing because he forgot to recreate it

389
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,300
 I find it absolutely fascinating. It's

390
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:43,700
 The the idea of a trained philosopher sitting down and talking to aliens. I really wish we had more of this conversation

391
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:51,420
 But we don't I guess I guess we got the best we could this famous philosopher sitting down with aliens

392
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,620
 And actually now to think about it. I wonder if this happens more often. I wonder if more aliens visit

393
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:02,100
 People who can ask these questions, but we don't hear the stories. I just found this story

394
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:11,740
 Right, maybe there are a lot more stories out there of these great minds sitting down with greater minds from another world and having these

395
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,540
 Conversations about life about the nature of things and maybe we haven't uncovered them

396
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,620
 Maybe those stories have never been told maybe those philosophers heard truths that they didn't think humanity was ready for

397
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:31,580
 Maybe sometimes it is better to keep the deep truths of the universe hidden and

398
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,300
 Feed the rest of us space pancakes

399
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,620
 Maybe that's all the truth we can actually digest

400
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:46,280
