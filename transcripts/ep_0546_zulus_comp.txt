 What happens when you sue the sexiest man alive?
 And then we take a look at the urban legends of
 misfits
 creatures
 Monsters forming a community and living on the outskirts of town
 Almost every area has some form of this legend
 But what happens when one of these urban legends enrolls in your college and joins your study group today on Dead Rabbit Radio?
 *Music*
 *Music*
 *Music*
 *Music*
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys having a great day - I'm doing little pistol finger guns
 *Pistol Fingers*
 We're gonna give a shout out to one of our legacy patreon supporters gun of liberty gun of liberty
 *Pistol Fingers*
 Everyone shoot at him he has to dodge all the bullets he's a little too slow
 He's like, ah should have stopped supporting the show before I got shot gun
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode whatever vehicle we take you're in charge of you can't support the patreon
 That's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show that helps out so much so gun of liberty
 We're gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna take a little road trip. We're headed out to Collins County, Texas
 We're driving by a bunch of armadillos on the side of the road waving to us and has their exposed predators are eating them
 They're like, ah, but we save them. I love armadillos. So we're gonna pick up a bunch of those little guys
 We're carrying them around I got big old backpack full armadillos. We're walking into this courthouse
 We walk in we see a woman standing there. That's not unusual
 There are women in Texas and sometimes they're in court. We walk in there
 We see a woman in here now. This is an ongoing legal case and I guess some of the documents have been sealed
 So we don't know her name so we're gonna call her
 Beatrice so beat and that adds just a shot in the dark if she happens to really be named Beatrice
 I'm just guessing but Beatrice is standing there and we get past security with my back full armadillos
 They let me in we're waiting for the defendant to show up
 so she's the plaintiff we're waiting for the other dude to show up and
 Then like a bunch of doves flying in like a beam of light. Whoa, it's not God
 God isn't the defendant beam of light comes in and in walks the sexiest man alive
 One of them at least according to People Magazine. It's Brad Pitt Brad Pitt walks in armadillos wrestling in my backpack
 They really want to get a good look at him Brad Pitt walks in sits in the defense area and the trial starts
 So now we're gonna do a little flashback
 What happened was back in 2018
 This woman Beatrice is sitting at home and she gets notified via Instagram email something like that. Hey, you don't know me
 Actually, you know me. I'm world famous superstar Brad Pitt
 But I was wondering if you could help me do this fundraiser because I have this
 Charity that we help build houses in Katrina not in Katrina. They're building houses during the hurricane
 They're building houses. He has a time machine. He's like don't tell anyone we're building houses during Katrina. It's hilarious
 He was
 Building houses that were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. He has this charity. It's called making it right or something like that
 He asked this woman. Yeah, he pitches this idea to this woman
 Why don't you host this fundraiser for me in Collins County, Texas?
 And I will come out myself Brad Pitt
 I will show up at this fundraiser event. So, you know, well, you'll be famous. You'll get to meet me
 you know, that's always a benefit and
 We'll both make some money most of the money goes to charity, but you know, we gotta get a little something for ourselves
 So she is totally on board with this idea, right? Who's going to turn down Brad Pitt?
 So she begins a little musical montage of her like putting up flyers around town
 She's like gals. You won't believe what I'm doing
 You won't believe what I'm doing and they're like, what's going on Beatrice? She goes, I'm hosting a fundraiser for Brad Pitt
 She does all this marketing. She gets all these people super excited in tiny little Collins County, Texas
 Brad Pitt's coming and I don't know where Collins County is
 But I doubt it's the most happenin spot in the state
 So anyways the date comes and Beatrice is all like super excited. She's like, oh my god
 I can't wait till I meet Brad Pitt. I've only been talking to him online
 I haven't seen any evidence that he exists outside of a movie
 Everyone shows up except for Brad Pitt Brad Pitt does not show up and everyone's super disappointed. She's like, what happened?
 You know, I spent all this time doing this musical montage, you know how hard it is to pull those off
 So anyways, she emails Brad Pitt and she goes, hey, I did everything he wanted
 You didn't show up and Brad Pitt goes. Oh, I'm super sorry about that. Something came up. Something came up
 So there's another hurricane. I had to go build houses in the middle of it. This is not a good charity
 I should figure out something else
 Tell you what do it again do this again
 I will be there this time because we really need raise money for the charity
 However, I need some money like cuz you know, it's like a union thing
 I just can't show up places like when I go to the supermarket the cashier pays me
 I need like I need an appearance fee. So you need you wire me some money
 So you guys know where this is going you wire me some money and then I'll show up
 You do all the marketing again. You do what you did before do the musical montage
 You give me the money I'll show up and then you'll get paid back from the money we raise and all that stuff
 And she's like, okay, that makes sense. It doesn't but features goes out nailing up signs on telephone poles and stuff like that
 plastering flyers to the back of armadillos and rolling them down the street
 She does the whole rigmarole all over again
 Every layer is probably like 80% of the people are excited this time first time everyone was super excited this time people are like
 Yeah, no, it's the big day. They have this big fundraiser and
 80% of the people show up
 Brad Pitt's a no-show. She's like, oh man now everyone super disappointed in her this happens
 five times in total over the course of two years
 Somebody convinced this woman that they were Brad Pitt. They were gonna come to her town
 and she needs to basically get everyone in town together and
 Brad Pitt wouldn't show up now the first from what I can gather
 So she got ripped off a total of
 $40,000
 What I imagine I don't know if this is accurate because we don't have access to all the court transcripts
 Yeah, it'll be hilarious when we do it
 This is how I imagine it the first one was just a joke
 The first one was just someone trying to see if a person would spend two months trying to
 Convincing everyone Brad Pitt is going to show up
 I figure like it was first the joke and then someone goes hey dude
 You won't believe this this woman thought I was Brad Pitt and someone goes oh really and
 They then took on the mantle then they put on their Brad Pitt mask and was like I'm gonna take this even further
 I'm gonna get some money. I don't know they could have been built in her money out from the beginning
 But over the course of two years
 This trick worked five separate times. I would have loved to be there the fifth time
 To see like you're in a giant arena
 Everyone's expecting Brad Pitt to come in but at this point nobody in town believes Brad Pitt is actually gonna show up
 That would have been hilarious to sit in an empty auditorium with like three other people
 She didn't think it was funny. She's out $40,000. So she's suing Brad Pitt for a hundred thousand dollars
 She's suing him and his charity. She said Brad Pitt defrauded me. He kept telling me he was gonna come to my town
 I was sending him money and he never showed up. So I'm suing him
 Brad Pitt if Brad Pitt's response to this is wait, what what's going on? Huh?
 He goes I didn't know anything. I've never met this woman before in my life. I've never talked to her
 I didn't know anything was going on until my people got like court paperwork
 Like I have no idea what this is about and the lawyers are the ones who are saying we
 This is great that this is now in the legal system
 The lawyers have introduced the theory of quote fake Brad Pitt's
 They believe there's multiple people out there impersonating Brad Pitt who were ripping this woman off and the woman's like no
 It was Brad Pitt. You know like did you see him? Did you like meet him in person?
 Did you ever like have a video conference call?
 It was Brad Pitt and how dare you mr. Pitt for saying that we never met because you also
 Said you were gonna marry me
 At this point I can imagine the judge the bait lift everyone just kind of putting their head in their hands being like
 Oh my god, you got you fell for two scams at the same time
 You fell for the good old fashioned fake Brad Pitt scam and you fell for the marriage scam
 She actually thought she was gonna marry this dude
 I don't think that Brad Pitt was I mean listen. I think Brad Pitt has better things to do
 At this time then to rip a woman off of 40 000 dollars
 Although that would be hilarious
 If you found out like Denzel washington
 great actor
 Great family man. He's also turns out that he loves running
 Pyramid schemes in his spare time
 If you found out that he owned a bunch of like juice bars
 He's like, oh no, no, no you come under the juice bar and then you you buy a juice bar
 And then the people who go into that juice bar they have to buy a juice bar. You can't lose money
 Both of his fingers crossed me on his back. They're like, how do you run a juice bar?
 Your hands are always behind your back. He's like, I'm Denzel Washington. I can do whatever I want.
 Yeah, I guess that's true. That'd be hilarious to find out that one of the biggest celebrities
 Is actually just constantly he's sitting he's putting malware on your computer because like oh thanks for calling Microsoft
 I can see your computer's locked up and you're like, hey, wait, wait, aren't you the guy from seven?
 He's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, can I get your credit card information?
 I don't think this court case is going to go anywhere. However, I did want to highlight it one because it is hilarious
 Two now the term fake Brad Pitt's is part of the American legal system
 But three gun of liberty get your guns ready because we're going to turn the lights down a little bit
 We're putting on our conspiracy caps. I made a joke
 Probably about 10 episodes back
 You guys remember this?
 about the brads
 There's a real offhand joke where I said there's a secret society of people named Brad and you can't convert
 You can't change your name. You have to be born a brad
 You can't just align yourselves with them. You only join this organization if you are born a brad. You got Brad Pitt
 Bradley Cooper
 Brad Paisley
 the brad from
 That guy the big old goofy guy on everyone lives Raymond and then um other brads
 Out there. You see and you think you're Jason. You're like, you're just joking, right? You're just joking. That's how these conspiracies start, right?
 That's how these conspiracies start. Everyone goes, oh man. He's just joking that guy that guy's constantly laughing on his podcast
 He's making it up
 Dude, I bet you you can follow the line back of brads
 I bet you you could find brads in ancient Egypt brads of the Illuminati
 So when we're looking at all these other groups
 We're going, oh, it's them. It's them. It's them. There's really right right behind you right behind you
 Is that big old lunkhead brad from everyone loves Raymond going like?
 Oh Raymond everyone loves you
 Because no one knows of the brads. You're like, what what how'd you get there?
 And he disappears in a puff of smoke the brads bro and
 I'll end the joke. Oh, no, it was not a joke. It's totally true. I'll end it with this
 I actually looked up the meaning
 I looked up the meaning of the name brad the name brad in English means
 Broad clearing in the woods
 Oh, that sounds like a place where secret societies hang out, right?
 They don't hang out in like cluttered forests think about it when you if I told you to picture picture a bunch of witches in the woods
 What did you picture? You pictured a clearing you pictured?
 A broad clearing in the woods. That's where the druids hang out. That's where a secret society would hang out, right?
 Their name literally means
 meeting place of the satanic
 And
 And stay with me brad we're getting ready to delete the show
 We're on to you and get this in welsh
 the name brad
 means treason
 So it's like the welsh people were aware of this brad takeover
 They knew that these guys were eventually going to make their move. So they declared them traitors
 Can you imagine being welsh and finding out that your name is brad and they're like, hey dad
 Uh, what what does my name mean and dad's like treason
 You're gonna be a traitorous scum to the human race
 Maybe the welsh knows something about the brad conspiracy. Maybe that's why the word rad is so popular nowadays in the year
 1986
 So be on the lookout for anyone named brad and if you get an email from a guy named brad bit asking if he can come to your home
 Don't do it. Actually, you know what do it do it do it because
 So you'd give me more stuff to talk about on
 I just I just read that article today and I was like just shaking my head
 anyways
 With the time we have left and talking about these two other stories, they're actually really cool
 They're actually really really good stuff and I'm glad I've kind of packaged this all together because we're getting ready to end the season
 So I wanted to cover a lot of really good stuff to finish this out strong gun of liberty. Let's hop in that dead rabbit durgible
 We're gonna take a real quick trip to florida. We're specifically going to the florida everglade. So
 We're taking that durgible up. I still got a couple armadillos on me
 This story was actually recommended by benet. He actually went through a long time listening to the show went through and found pig
 People in every single state in america. I think there was only three states that didn't have them
 I wonder if there's one in alaska. He had gave me the list
 He gave me this huge list and every show i'm gonna go through
 That's what we're gonna pop around and check out here in the florida everglades where these
 Squallies is what they're known as they're not known as pig people. It's not politically correct. They're like, sir
 We are squallies. This is one of those interesting stories where we see real life and
 fiction or possible fiction collide and thanks for the recommendation
 In the florida and i got a lot of this information from the website phantoms and monsters as well
 So i want to give them a shout out also
 So in the florida everglades, there was actually this piece of land that was set aside for development because who doesn't want to live
 In the florida everglades assuming you're not a swamp witch. I don't know who would want to live there
 But they started to actually develop all of this property. They were calling it golden gate estates
 So there's actually like some roads apparently and there's some houses that were built and then they just go
 Why are we building them here? This is a horrible place. It stinks like a swamp
 The developers like yeah, i should have visited this place. So it's been abandoned and now it's called alligator alley because there's just like
 Alligators obviously a bunch of bears running around. I know there were bears in the swamp. How do they swim?
 Panthers down there. That's pretty dope a bunch of hogs running around and the squallies and the squallies
 So what the squallies are they're tiny little pig people
 Well to be specific they're tiny little people with pig snouts. So I think everything else is normal about them
 and at their peak
 people believed there was about
 50
 Of these little squallies running around now. I don't know where they got their clothes
 Maybe there are seamstresses and stuff like that. Maybe they all had like a class profession when they decided to mutate into a pig person
 They're like, ah, I'm a blacksmith now
 But apparently they had clothes and stuff like that and of course this is what's interesting because you have this is very typical for these urban legends
 We have a location
 That's remote and it's spooky because you see kind of a half developed area in the in the swamp
 Then you have to fill it with your imagination. You have to fill it with some sort of population in this area
 You came up with little pig people now you have to have an origin story
 And we actually have a couple of those one of them is that there was a government experiment that went wrong
 That that's one theory the government was trying to they're like, how do we build how do we build the perfect pig person?
 I can't believe that the so it's our head of us on this
 And so they are grabbing people and like taking pigs and just kind of pushing them together pushing them together until finally
 They morphed into one
 That's how genetics work during the cold war
 The other theory is that they're a bunch of freaks and obviously freaks, but inbred freaks
 So like people are banging each other and then like they're banging people are too closely related to them
 And this keeps going on and on and on eventually a pig person pops out and then that that's also
 Works during the cold war pig people are then banging each other and then that only begets more pig people until eventually
 You have a population of the squalys some people believe there's still a bunch of squalys out there
 Again, this is an urban legend that you would pass around high schools elementary schools
 Brothers would tell their younger siblings to scare them. Oh, yeah, I saw I saw squally the other day
 It looked just like you. I don't look like a pig person
 You know all that stuff all that teasing and then of course you have the legend of the guardian
 You have someone looking out for him
 There's oh supposedly an old man out there with a shotgun that chases people on
 So that's why when you go to see the squalys you don't run into them
 You can be like, oh, maybe the guardian like made him go away or something
 Maybe the cardy was having a pork roast party
 Maybe seen a bunch of pulled porky adult squalys. Who knows?
 But you have these these are very very typical parts of the legend and then you have the one piece of the story
 Then you have a police report
 so supposedly back in 2011 so
 Very very recent as far as urban legends goes. This is june 14th, 2011. There was a guy named james scarborough
 He's riding his motorcycle down the floor to Everglades apparently it's a hydrofoil
 And he wrecks it probably because he's driving it through the swamp
 But he wrecks it and the police show up and they're like
 Hey, dude, what is going on? Why are you like just laying there underneath your motorcycle and he goes?
 I'm sure you might have told that he laid there the whole time. He's like, oh, this is kind of comfortable
 Hot exhaust right on his belly. He said he was driving on the road. Yeah
 and a boogie man
 Jumped out at him quote unquote boogie man. The cops are looking at each other. They're like
 I told you
 Cops like I shut up mark boogie man is not real
 But he said the boogie man jumped down in front of him and he wrecked his bike
 So he's in the general vicinity of this and people go
 Was it a really a little little pick person? Was it a squally?
 Is that what he actually saw that got in front of the motorcycle? So you have that police report
 Also, apparently in the police report the police report. He smelled of alcohol
 So whether it was a boogie man or just he was inebriated. He's like, oh, I'm trapped underneath my motorcycle cops
 He sees the cops cars coming up. He's like come up with the story come up with the story real real quick
 He's like, aha the boogie man that'll get me out of trouble
 This is all the hallmarks of a classic
 urban legend a contained
 Urban legend. This isn't something that you would hear about in romania or brazil
 But you would be very familiar with it if you lived in the florida everglades in that area
 Just the same thing if you lived in brazil or romania, they
 There would be cities in those countries that would have very contained
 Little urban legends like that and we got one more to check out. It's another recommendation gun of liberty fire up that carboner copter
 We are headed up to canada
 We're headed to huntington that is in mont reggae
 kubeck
 Canada it's a small town as of 2016. They only had about 2400 people
 So it's a small town, but it has a legend very much like the squally
 This one was actually shared with me his personal story
 From a patreon supporter named dave. So we're gonna wave to dave. He's kind of hanging out there
 He's eating some canadian cheetos and we're like, hey, what's up, bro? He's talking with his mouth full
 We're like, okay, you can wait till you know what the cheetos, bro
 He actually has given me a bunch of video games on steam too. So I appreciate that as well. I'm gonna play some on my vacation
 Takes a huge star. He's he swallows his food and he starts talking to us. He tells us this story
 Really interesting story
 Dave tells this story. So he went to high school about 50 miles away from huntington
 He's 50 miles away. He's in high school and one of his buddy starts talking about
 The zulus. He's like what?
 But he's like, oh, dude, you haven't heard about the zulus. He's like, no, I don't
 What are you talking about? I've heard of zulus. I know of the zulu empire, but
 Why are you bringing them up? He goes, no, no, no, no, no, not those zulus the zulus in huntington
 And davinus friends are like, what what are you just just to get to the point?
 We have no idea what you're talking about and their friend
 Tells this story about how in huntington on the outskirts of town
 There's a group of humans, but are they human the friend posited and paused a little too long. He says
 They have all white skin
 with
 White hair. It's falling out. Some of them don't have any hair at all
 You're thinking albinos. He's like, no, no, no. These are zulus, man
 They're completely white
 They're completely bald. They have no eyebrows. They don't even have eyelashes
 Their teeth are crooked
 Jagged in each direction. They stare at you with bluish gray eyes
 You're like, you're just describing an albino, right? It's like, no, no, no, they have pink eyes and
 Here's the most odd thing about the zulus
 They have no fingernails
 You're like, what that is kind of a weird combination of details like he's like, no, no, no, no, I'm not even done
 And then he adds because that's just like a physical abnormality. He goes, no, they're actually incredibly vicious as well
 Inbred hillbillies is what I heard
 Hillbillies in Canada. I guess they have them up there too
 They're banging each other. See?
 Yeah, I know what inbred means dude. He's like, okay, I'm about to pull out a chart
 He goes these dudes. They're banging each other and they're having more of these little freakish zulu babies
 And and Dave thought this was one of the dumbest things. He was just laughed. He's like, what?
 Because we've all heard these urban legends growing up
 But usually we hear when we're like eight or nine don't go down the tunnel. That's where pennywise lives
 You don't say that to a 20 year old. They're like, gulp. Oh, no. I'm not going down the tunnel
 You hear that when you're kids and there's only 50 miles away. So Dave's like, what? No, I don't know
 And he said that that became a running joke with him and his friends
 They'd make fun of the idea of these pale inbred hillbillies
 running around
 And kind of make fun of the friend at the same time for believing it. No, no, they're real. They're real
 It's getting dragged into the bush by bunch of zulus
 He doesn't really think about it over time and five years later
 He's in college and the teacher is setting everyone up with their steady buddy
 And it's all random. You can pick to someone he meets this guy
 He's super and he got one of the nicest guys you could ever meet this guy was super dope
 Hella chill and we're sitting there talking and we're getting you know, building the report doing notes and all that stuff
 He goes and then I he goes. I don't really he looked a little pale, but I really think anything of it
 When I got home a little light bulb being pops up. He goes wait a second
 He was pale
 He didn't have a lot of hair. He didn't have any eyebrows
 He didn't have any fingernails either
 So he's thinking listen again
 The guy in college was obviously not an inbred cannibal freak wasn't trying to eat him
 They weren't in cooking class. He's like oh, this this is my favorite class. Everyone looks so delicious
 This is super nice guy
 He goes people have albinism and things like that
 But it sparks him in his head and he begins to do research
 Which he didn't do when he was in high school and even if he had done it in high school
 He most likely wouldn't have found anything
 Because what he found was an article written
 In the kubek newspaper called the myth of the zulus of huntington
 And it was a full out investigation
 Into this group. It was written by marco forrier
 And these people are 100 real. They are not inbred. They are not
 Vicious cannibals. I kept adding the cannibal part. He never said anything about cannibals. They are not inbreds. They are not vicious
 They were a very very fascinating
 story of
 Bigotry. What happened was they believe that a french settler when he's coming over to the region
 Carried a gene that causes something known as
 Closed in syndrome and it is all of the physical markers
 That dave described all you don't have fingernails
 Hairs missing all that stuff some of them have a little more hair than others
 But it is 100 a very real genetic misfire
 It's extremely rare, but it is genetic
 And what would happen is and it's funny because all the time we talk about urban legends
 And origins and how these things work take that template even take the template for the squallies and we can put it over this one
 We can see how the legend is so close to the reality. What happened was you had these people who were born with this
 Like 150 years ago and they were ostracized
 And then someone else who was still in that family was ostracized and over time those people
 I don't know. They're not inbred. They're not inbred, but they had a distinct ancestor
 But if someone with claustin syndrome has a child with someone else with claustin syndrome
 There's a one and two chance the child will have claustin syndrome and because these people were purged from society
 They could only really have sex with other people with this disease
 They were pushed to a place called the back town
 It was between two railroad tracks in huntington
 If you had claustin syndrome
 You lived in the back town. Your neighbors had claustin syndrome. Your friends had claustin syndrome
 So when you got older your mate
 Had claustin syndrome
 The people in huntington would not let you work in any job that required you to be in the public
 There's one kid goes a lot of them ended up doing it work
 Because one kid goes I always grew up. I wanted to work at a gas station. I always thought that'd be so fun
 Here I am sitting sitting behind a computer making 50 000 a year. Oh no, but you know what I mean? Like people have different dreams
 I love working retail. I love working retail of walking into the place and organizing all the
 The merchant dot I love it. I love every aspect of working retail
 That was his dream, but there he was like I knew as I got older
 There was no way I could work with the public and he goes I'm really one of the lucky ones a lot of people with this
 They just became drug addicts
 They got spit on all the time the police used to come into this neighborhood just knock down doors
 because they could
 Other people in town would say I remember when the who didn't have claustin syndrome
 They go oh, I remember like on sundays my dad would get us all in the car. We drive to the back town
 Drive through and view all these freaks
 So in the town itself it was a knowing that these people existed, but as you got further out from huntington
 Yeah, no idea and and pre internet pre anyone really researching this stuff. It was just a local story
 Dave heard it and didn't believe it if there was no corresponding like there was no article for that
 Dave would have just went on thinking that even that guy wouldn't have been like, hey, you're not one of those zulus
 Are you you just thought oh this guy has
 Albinism and if I told you that story the first part of that story about the zulus
 Like I told the story of the squallies
 We'd go oh another weird urban legend a bunch of inbred freaks running around nowadays
 They've actually come a long way
 No, no, that's not fair to say nowadays
 Society has come a long way into just accepting them for what they are
 Because for the longest time they were considered to be the way they were because they were
 Syphilitic they had syphilis
 So you don't want to be anywhere near them. You definitely don't want to date them. So they end up dating each other
 Nowadays people go at this just some sort of medical quirk. It's a genetic quirk. We know these things happen
 And people say you know the kids today now because they would basically get beat up at school nowadays
 They go yeah, I get teased every once in a while. It's not as bad as my parents had it
 I heard my parents, you know looking them over there. He's not just doing heroin now
 That's my dad because they had a really rough go at it. You couldn't work
 You got spin on every time you walked outside. You got people
 50 miles away talking about you eating other people
 It's an interesting story and thanks day for sharing that with us
 It's an interesting story because it carries all the hallmarks of an urban legend and it's true
 There's obviously the embellishments. They weren't vicious freaks. They weren't running around eating people. That was my own embellishment
 They didn't have syphilis. They are more than capable of
 integrating with society with society that held their hand that would say no
 Because they believe those rumors about them
 Dave who heard the story and didn't really
 Believe it. He thought it was fake when he came face to face with one. It didn't even cross his mind
 But what if Dave's friend had met that guy?
 Oh my god, you're one of those
 They're different reaction to that
 And stories like this really make us have to take another look at urban legends
 How many times do we hear of these stories and go? Ah, I can't be true. Aren't you big people in florida?
 But there probably was
 A at least a a kernel of truth to that there may have been a disfigured man or a disfigured family
 out there
 And one sighting became five and then five became 20 and then 20 became 50 and so on and so forth
 But a lot of these urban legends have some
 Grain of truth in them, but no one expects to go to college and meet one of them
 So the next time you're driving in the middle of nowhere
 Remember that the pig people could be real
 The next time you're getting into your car late at night
 Just remember there really may be a serial killer in the back seat
 and know that
 When you shut that bathroom light off before you leave the bathroom
 And there's that quick glimmer
 Of something in your mirror that could be bloody mary
 Waiting to prove herself to you

 But they may be right
 They may get the facts wrong, but the truth is often interwoven
 into fiction
