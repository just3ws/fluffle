00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 When two friends are driving through Florida, they have no idea they're about to have a close encounter of the "turned" kind.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to the home of a grieving sister.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 After her older brother passed away in 2021, she's had a lot of pent-up feelings of remorse and anger at the entire situation.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But just when she might be working on putting the pieces back together and moving on, from beyond the nether, her brother begins to scream.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [music]

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I think I'm going to check out that new M. Night Shyamalan movie. I'm going to roll the dice. I'm going to roll the dice. It's always a roll of the dice.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It's always a gamble checking out that guy's films. I'm going to check out the new M. Night Shyamalan movie, "Knock at the Cabin."

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We'll see how it is. We'll see if I come back next week with a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But someone who I always will recommend walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Everyone give it up for Vince Garcia Velazquez.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Walk on in! Come on in! No spoilers! Don't give it away!

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 "Knock at the Cabin." Vince, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Vince has actually suggested a lot of stories to us.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 He sent the one over about the earthquake that keeps happening in Mexico on that particular day.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'll put the episode on the show notes. It was a really weird one.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Vince, thanks for sending that over and thanks for supporting the show. Vince, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That helps out so much. And also, let's take a look at this awesome submission for Fan Art Friday.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This comes from Still Noided. Still Noided.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's an interesting take on both the Ash Black Dead Rabbit Radio logo and the Grant Scott Dead Rabbit Radio logo with the, as above so below pose.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's fantastic! This is so awesome. I love getting this stuff from you guys.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Thank you so much, Still Noided, for sending this on over. Really, really appreciate it.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Vince, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Everyone grab on to Vince's waist as he jumps off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Glide us all the way out to Florida.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 [Hissing]

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Specifically, we're headed out to a place known as Callahan, Florida.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It's August 26th, 1974. It's 9 p.m. at night.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And we're about to join two friends. Two friends.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 One of them is Linda Stahlnaker and then her buddy, who she doesn't name.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 She talks about being in the friend zone. You don't even get a name during your paranormal encounter.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 She's just like, "Oh, he was just a friend. We're going to go ahead and call him Bobby."

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So Lydia and Bobby are driving from Jacksonville to Callahan just friends.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And on this journey, they see a bright flashing light flying right above the tree line.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now they're headed to Callahan. I'm sure they had plans. 9 p.m. is pretty early in the night.

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 You still got a lot of stuff to do. Maybe they were going clubbing. Maybe they were going to a coffee shop.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 We don't know. Whatever your plans were, whatever they were.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 If you see a UFO, maybe that's your plans for the night.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Maybe you've decided to be like, "Well, you know, we can catch Goldfinger in concert another week.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 We just saw a UFO fly by. Let's follow that."

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So that's what Lydia and Bobby do. They decide to follow the light.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And when they see it dip below the tree line, they can kind of figure out where it may have landed.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So Bobby is continuing to drive towards this light. But as they get closer to where this thing may have landed,

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Lydia begins to feel cold. She feels the temperature drop around her.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And now she's actually starting to shake. It's so cold, her entire body is beginning to shiver.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And she asks Bobby to turn around. Turn the car around. I don't have a good feeling about this.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Can you please turn around? And Bobby does. And then are headed in the opposite direction.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But it's too late. Lydia is continuing to shake and shiver.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And it begins to feel like she's being smothered. She can't catch her breath.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Something physiological is happening to her. She's in full panic mode at this point.

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 A moment passes and all of the physical sensations are gone.

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Lydia no longer feels like she's being suffocated. She's no longer shaking. She's no longer cold.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Bobby is driving down a completely different road than they were on just a second ago. Now he's on a completely different road.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Heading home, it's 12 a.m. Neither of them have any memories of what happened in that three hour time period. Zero.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 They don't know what happened and how would you even be able to start to quantify that.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 We cover a lot of missing time. It's fairly common in UFO accounts and this is no exception.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 For the next few days though, Lydia begins to feel physically ill.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 She's suffering extreme headaches. She can't concentrate at work. She's emotionally unstable.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 She's kicking some of the books. She works at a daycare center. She's kicking the kids over. She goes, "I can't do this anymore."

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 She's emotionally unstable, physically sick. It's affecting her job and her personal life. She doesn't know what to do.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And she kind of thinks this could be connected to what might have happened that night.

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 They saw the light and the next thing they know, they're driving in another direction.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So she calls up Bobby to see if he's experiencing any side effects.

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Bobby doesn't pick up the phone. In fact, she never saw Bobby again.

68
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Now, according to this account, they were friends. I made a couple of jokes about them dating earlier.

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 I don't know if they were casual friends, if they were lifelong friends, if he actually was pining over Lydia.

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I don't know any of that stuff, even though I made several jokes about it.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I don't know what the relationship status was, but if it was a casual friendship, she'd met him three weeks previous.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 The fact that he ghosted her, well, whatever.

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But if they were friends any longer, then it would be weird to just lose contact with one of your friends.

74
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 She's never seen him since. She tries calling him a couple of times, tries to figure out if he is also ill.

75
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And to this day, to this day, she's never seen Bobby again.

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But let's go back to this narrative here. We'll catch up to the modern day in a moment.

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 We're still back in 1974. Well, actually, at this point, it's spring at 1975, and Lydia can still not get her act together.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 She's no longer throwing up every morning, but she still feels like something must have happened to her on that journey.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 She can't figure out what it is, so she begins to see a professional.

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 She begins to see like a psychiatrist for what could have happened, and they put her under.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 They use hypnosis to see, well, let's see if we can recover any memories.

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 She says what she remembered was that they did find the spacecraft, and it had landed.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 They see the spacecraft, and it is touched down.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 What's interesting is, remember the car turned around, and that's when she started feeling suffocated, and time seemed to stop.

85
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So it's interesting, even when they turned around, were they then headed in the right direction?

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Did they turn around at all in that moment? Like, what was mentally going on?

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We don't know. Like, that memory itself is odd, but they did come across the UFO.

88
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 It was landed, and she felt compelled to board the spacecraft.

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 She got out of the car and began walking towards this landed UFO, and she doesn't give any description of the aliens.

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 She just refers to them as aliens, which would make us think they were human or humanoid.

91
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Most like, Pleiadians would be my guess. That's the most humanoid of alien species.

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But again, we've classified, like in UFOology, there's basically like five major classifications, but who knows?

93
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Like, if you believe in the alien phenomenon, I don't think it can just be like, these are the Pleiadians, these are the Reptilians, these are the insectoids.

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 There's pretty countless possible species out there.

95
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Anyway, she comes across these humanoids, she walks aboard this ship, they strap her down to a table, and it's basically this rotating...

96
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 It wasn't rotating when they strapped her down, they waited until she was secure, but imagine two gurneys, two of those like medical gurneys,

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and they're basically fused together at the top, and she's laying down on one of them, and she's strapped down, and all the gurney that is, you know, on top...

98
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Oh my God, I wish I could just draw a picture, which this was a video podcast.

99
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Imagine if you had two gurneys pressed together, and you had a person laying foot to head on one,

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and then the other person was laying foot to head on theirs, and your heads were facing the same direction.

101
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And this is a device, and once they're in, once they're strapped down to this table, once Lydia, because the one woman is already on the table strapped down,

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 now they're strapping Lydia down, and then they put this device that enclosed both of their heads together.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I'm not even going to try to describe that, it's like some sort of glass thing.

104
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And the two tables begin spinning.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 [demonstrates]

106
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And Lydia passes out.

107
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Lydia said she started to come to as the tables were slowing down, and as the tables were slowing down, she felt this warm sensation pass through her,

108
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 starting at the top of her head, and pass through her entire body down to her feet.

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And at that point, the device over her head that is also attached to this other woman's head is removed,

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and Lydia is told that the other woman strapped to that gurney is Antron.

111
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 She's like, "Who's Antron? I don't know, I'm human. Is that some like pop superstar on your planet?"

112
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 They go, "No, no, no. Antron is just one of us. She's this alien."

113
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And her consciousness has been transferred into your body, and she will be a part of your body for a period of time.

114
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 You will host the consciousness of this alien.

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And the aliens around her, Lydia, said they seemed very pleased that the experiment went well.

116
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I imagine these things can go south, no matter how advanced your technology is.

117
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Every so often you're going to drop the vial.

118
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 They were very pleased that this went well.

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 They helped Lydia up off the gurney. She begins walking back to the car.

120
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 She sees Bobby in the car. Bobby never left. He was passed out in the car.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And she sees the car. She sees Bobby's passed out in the car.

122
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 The next thing she remembers, they're driving back home.

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's an interesting story. I found it on ThinkAboutDocs.com.

124
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 They got it from two UFO researchers, a Dr. James Harder and a Dr. Evelyn Brunson.

125
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I actually don't know if Dr. Evelyn Brunson is specifically a UFO researcher.

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I wasn't able to clarify that, but Dr. James Harder is.

127
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Now, what's interesting is, as an abduction story, that's fairly unique.

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This is so fascinating to me. We have this woman who has this UFO experience.

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Now, there's a couple of different things you can do with that type of experience.

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 You could never tell anyone. I think that's probably the most common thing.

131
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 You can use it to kind of change the way you look at the world and realize that we are not alone.

132
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 You may take it as a social cause. The aliens may tell you something about saving the environment or whatever,

133
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and then you just decide to like start saying, "Get oil. Get oil out of here," and all that.

134
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Or you can become a huckster.

135
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Now, I'm not saying that her claims are made up, but when you come in contact with aliens,

136
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I definitely understand trying to make money off of it.

137
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I don't necessarily agree with that. I mean, if you're writing books, that's fine.

138
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You're doing speaking tours or whatever.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 But then when you start talking about, "I have access to the seven universal truths by my book, and it'll change your life,"

140
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 that's when I'm a little like, "You're a huckster."

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But let's take a look at what happened after this story, after the Think About Docs.com article.

142
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 There's a book written by Nigel Watson called, "Captured by Aliens, a History and Analysis of American Abduction Claims."

143
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And in this book, we get a little more information.

144
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 She says, Lydia says that she was actually gained psychic powers from this transfer.

145
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And she tells us that Anton actually came from a green planet in another galaxy,

146
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and she traveled around in a glass tube in a spaceship. Basically, she lived in a big jar.

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 This is one of those things that sometimes the less information you have, the better.

148
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 If you ever get abducted by aliens and you have all of this really cool story to share with the world,

149
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 but then it also turns out that the aliens eat farts, don't tell people that.

150
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Just keep that to yourself.

151
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And the thing is, is that in 1974, the idea of intergalactic aliens, right?

152
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Like, nowadays, it's hard enough to fly across the galaxy with modern UFO lore.

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Even if you'd have to get into interdimensional stuff, which a lot of alien purists don't do that.

154
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 They talk about the aliens evolved on another planet. They're coming here.

155
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 From another galaxy is even more ridiculous. Flying around in a glass jar, she wasn't, her ship wasn't like an old mason jar.

156
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But you know what I mean? Like, you sometimes just leave details out is what I'm saying.

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 If you ever get abducted by aliens, leave out the goofy details.

158
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And then she says, you know, Anton was in my body. She was too powerful.

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And I eventually had to just go with the flow because when I was fighting it, it was making it worse.

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I retreated into my own mind and then eventually came to terms with all of it.

161
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And then I found this tiny article in the United Press International.

162
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It was just kind of a wire service talking about Lydia's story.

163
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 She has gone on speaking tours, which is pretty normal.

164
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And she declares herself as I am one of, this is a quote from her quote,

165
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 I am one of the five most documented UFO abduction cases in the United States.

166
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Have you ever heard of her before? I thought that was super interesting.

167
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I read that that may or may not be true. I mean, you figure Betty and Barney Hill,

168
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 you figure a Whitley Striper, Fire in the Sky guy.

169
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I forgot what his name was. Travis, what was it?

170
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Let me look it up. Travis Walton, right? And two others.

171
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Lydia Travis Walton, Betty and Barney Hill, Whitley Striper.

172
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And then one more. I've never heard of her before. And I'm not saying that,

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 that she could totally be right. She could totally be right.

174
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 At the time, she was one of the five most documented.

175
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Like she was legit. She was one of the biggies.

176
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And that totally could be true. There's a ton of stuff I've never heard of.

177
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That's why I have a podcast that's over a thousand episodes of stuff I've never heard of.

178
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I'm discovering this stuff for the first time just like you are.

179
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Or maybe you know better. You're like, Jason, she's super popular.

180
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 How did you not know about her? It's kind of ruining your reputation.

181
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I've never heard of her and I think I know why.

182
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Because you got to watch what you do. You got to watch.

183
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I honestly believe that she probably had this encounter. I'm not poo-pooing

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 anything that she's saying. I don't think that it was fake. It could be.

185
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But I'm not getting that read on it. The problem is that

186
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 she went to Huxtery.

187
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 She started to sell the secret.

188
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Like you know, Whitley Shriver wrote books

189
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and did speaking tours. People expect witnesses.

190
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 People expect abduction. Experiencers to do stuff like that.

191
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But when you start talking about the seven powers of God

192
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and you're selling the secret formula

193
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 to open up your life

194
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 for the better. And I have no problem with that. I have no problem with self-help stuff.

195
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But you understand like that division. Travis Walton wasn't running around

196
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 saying, "I found out the secrets of the universe."

197
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Those aliens were pretty brutal. They were trying to cut them open.

198
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Betty and Barney Hill weren't saying, "Oh, we know all of this stuff and if you buy our

199
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 water, if you buy the water out of our radiator in our car

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 it will heal your wounds." That's the card of the aliens.

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 There really is a difference there. And really the last piece of information

202
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I could find on Lydia cements the end of her saga.

203
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 This would pretty much just be the end of any story.

204
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 There was an ad in the Weekly World News

205
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 which, sorry to say, is no longer in production. I think their website is still

206
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 chugging along. But Weekly World News was one of

207
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 those tabloids you used to see at the grocery store and it had headlines

208
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 like "Batboy Runs for President," "Skeletons on the Moon."

209
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We've actually covered Angels in Space. We've covered stories from Weekly World

210
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 News that have entered into paranormal

211
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 culture. They're totally made up. The Angels in Space is probably the most famous

212
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 one. I saw that on the internet as a legit paranormal phenomenon

213
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and traced it back to the Weekly World News. And I was like, "I wasted an hour on this."

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I wasted an hour. We did the episode on it.

215
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 It was fun. But I remember when I first saw that story. It was on a paranormal website.

216
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I was like, "Wow, that's totally awesome." And then when I went to do more research for the

217
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 podcast, I was like, "Wow, what a waste of time. It's not true." And you'll still see

218
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 it pop up. Weekly World News, I loved it. I read it all the time as a kid.

219
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's great. It's a fictional newspaper. But in real life

220
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 it's made up stuff. And Lydia was buying ads in that

221
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 newspaper. It's not a good look. And in the

222
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 ads that she was selling, there was this ad from February 10th, 1981

223
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 where she is selling the Cross of Antron.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 She says that Antron, she talks about this alien experience. And I'm

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 sure she probably did. I'm sure people in 1981, when they saw her name, they would remember

226
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 her. She's one of the fifth most documented UFO. I don't know if

227
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 that claims true. But let's just assume that it is, right? You recognize her

228
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 name? She says that Antron told her that God was real and gave her

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 the design for the Cross of Antron. It's basically a little

230
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 crucifix--it's a cross on a necklace. But it has pyramid designs

231
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 on it. It's not just a normal cross. It has these pyramid designs. And

232
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 in the middle there's this oval. And I mean, listen, this may have come from an alien.

233
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 She may not have had any choice at what this looked like.

234
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But obviously, if you're selling something called the Cross of

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Antron and you're talking about God being real, you're

236
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 selling it to Christians. It looks like a cross you're selling it to Christians.

237
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 It's probably not a good idea--or, more specifically,

238
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Christians who believe in aliens. So you have a fairly small market.

239
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It's probably not a good idea that in your cross that an alien gave you

240
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 in the design, there's also an upside down cross inside.

241
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And there's like an S. It's quite complicated. And most Christians are not going to buy

242
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 a cross that part of it is an upside down cross.

243
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That's just kind of logical. Now you could argue, Jason, it's an alien designed it.

244
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 An alien designed it. It contains the power of Antron. Well,

245
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I will accept that Lydia's experience is real.

246
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 That's definitely going to happen. And this alien could have given her a cross.

247
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But if you're trying to sell it,

248
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 maybe raise that part. You're like, "Oh, the alien got this part wrong."

249
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Spookle, spookle, spookle. Here's a new one. I don't believe the cross is real. I don't believe the alien

250
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 actually gave her the cross. That's my thing. I think

251
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 at this point she was trying to sell the seven powers of

252
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 God. She was trying to sell this new lifestyle, this new hippie-dippy

253
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 nonsense. I could be wrong. Maybe the alien gave her the seven powers

254
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 of God and gave her the cross. But whatever, whether or not she made it up or the alien

255
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 gave it to her, she is far. I mean, again, I had a hard time

256
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 finding information on her. It wasn't impossible. I did find all this stuff.

257
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You're like, "Jason, you found a bunch of stuff on her. You're like, "What, books, stuff like that?"

258
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Obviously, if I typed in Whitley Stryber or Betty and Varney Hill,

259
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I'm going to find a lot more. I think you can actually ruin your reputation as an

260
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 experiencer. Not if you try to make money off of it, but if you try to make the wrong

261
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 kind of money off of it.

262
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 You know what I'm saying? There's good and bad ways

263
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 to exploit your experience.

264
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And you kind of have to navigate that. Again,

265
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Whitley Stryber can write book after book about it and sell the movie rights and all that stuff. It's totally fine.

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I'm not saying that game is to be sold, not to be

267
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 told. You do have an ability to make money off

268
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 your experience. But you've got to be careful

269
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 because if people smell a scam, even if an alien was like,

270
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 "Here, give this cross to your people. It'll bring them peace. It'll show them the seven powers

271
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 of God." If people smell a scam, they'll run away. You might get a

272
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 small, dedicated cult maybe following you.

273
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But I think it did. I think she, these

274
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 decisions she made ended up, she may have been a super famous

275
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 alien abductee back in the day, but it just got too

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 weird. And it started to smell like a scam.

277
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And you got enough of that running around in the paranormal community.

278
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Fake ghost hunters, that's quite harmless.

279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Fake ghost hunting is quite harmless. People who lie about being abducted by aliens, again, it's quite

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 harmless. But when something starts to smell like a money-making venture,

281
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 at best, and at worst, the start of a cult, people will

282
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 shun you from the general community. So anyway, it's a very interesting

283
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 story. The UFO story is interesting, and the aftermath

284
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 to it as well. Where's Bobby? Where's Bobby at? Who knows where Bobby

285
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 is. But a fascinating story nonetheless. And I don't know if she's still around.

286
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Like, I was able to find little scraps, little bits about her. But

287
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 an interesting story nonetheless. Vince, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the

288
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 carbonic objector. We are saying goodbye to Lydia. She's waving

289
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 to us. She's like, "You guys sure you don't want to know the seven powers of God?"

290
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I think we can probably figure them out. Love your neighbor. Love your neighbor.

291
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Do unto others as they would have to do unto you. She's like, "Oh, did you get to attack my aliens? How did you know that stuff?"

292
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 We're like, "Uh..." Just fly us out. Fly us out of

293
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Florida. We're leaving that state behind. Take us all

294
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 the way out to a house in the suburbs.

295
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 [imitates the sound of the house]

296
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 This is a story that I found online. We don't have a specific

297
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 location for it. It could take place at any house.

298
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Possibly yours. It's possible that you are the person

299
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 who...we're going to call Sheila. We don't have her actual name. We're going to go ahead and call her Sheila.

300
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Online, she goes by the name T-Darn

301
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 96. But we're going to go ahead and call her Sheila.

302
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Back in fall of 2021, her older brother passed away.

303
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 He had a heart attack. He was quite a young man.

304
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 He died of a heart attack. She goes,

305
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 "There was a seven-year age difference between us, and we weren't

306
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 super close. Not just because of the age difference. That did play a

307
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 factor, but we had different dads."

308
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 We had different dads, so obviously my dad

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 had issues with him. He was a very toxic

310
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 home environment for all of us. And

311
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 my brother had bipolar disorder, and it was not

312
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 diagnosed until it was too late.

313
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He began using drugs in the sixth grade.

314
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 A lot of times, you know, you're trying to self-medicate. You don't know what

315
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 is wrong with you. It hasn't been diagnosed. You begin to self-medicate.

316
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 He begins using drugs in the sixth grade, man. That's super rough.

317
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Well, in fall of 2021, he passed away.

318
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Obviously, Sheila had a lot of...she's grieving,

319
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 but she also has a lot of...

320
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 It would be a crockpot full of emotions.

321
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 You'd be kind of angry. You'd be sad. You'd be angry at your parents that you didn't have a good

322
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 relationship with your brother. You'd be angry at your brother because he died.

323
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 You'd be angry at your brother because of the choices he had made that kept

324
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 you guys apart. It's just this huge cauldron of stuff.

325
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Huge cauldron of stuff that you need to work through.

326
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 After he passed away, let's call the brother Tony. I don't think

327
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 we should give this guy a name. After Tony passed away,

328
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Sheila ended up talking to a mutual friend.

329
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And this friend said, "Listen, you know, Tony... Tony

330
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 confided in me. He wanted to have a better relationship with you. He really

331
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 wished that you guys were closer, but he didn't know how

332
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 to bridge that gap. He didn't

333
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 know how to reach out to you. He wanted to be closer with you for years, but definitely

334
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 as you guys are becoming adults, it's even more important.

335
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 At some point in life, siblings go from hating each other's guts to

336
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 being like, "Oh, you know, this is my best friend. Like, it's weird and it doesn't happen until like, your

337
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 20s, until everyone's like, older." When you're like, "Wow, we made it. We're

338
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 brothers together." And I can definitely understand Tony

339
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 being outside the family looking in and wishing he was part of it.

340
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 But when you start using drugs in the sixth grade, when you have

341
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 undiagnosed mental problems, it makes it hard. And that's just the stuff on the surface.

342
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Again, different dads, who knows how many fights they got into that house,

343
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 how many arguments, how many ridiculous screaming matches over

344
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 inane things, and now Tony's dead.

345
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 All those fights are over.

346
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But you remember every one of those fights.

347
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And it breaks your heart when you think about it. You were yelling at a young man who was never

348
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 going to make it to be an old man. It's quite tragic.

349
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And the friend goes, "You know, Tony wanted to be very close to you,

350
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 but he always just felt like an outsider to the whole family.

351
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 He never felt like he belonged.

352
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So it wasn't just a matter of being able to reach out to you. It's like,

353
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 how do you even start that process when you feel like you're not part of the family?

354
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Tony's not part of the family. He sees, you know, it's just this huge thing. Tony

355
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 has all these emotional scars. Sheila has all these emotional scars.

356
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But he has a

357
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 home with Sheila now.

358
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Now that he has passed away, Sheila has his

359
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 ashes in an urn and his

360
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 old high school jersey.

361
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 She has them in this place. I don't know if it's like, I don't know if the jerseys hung up

362
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 or something like that. I don't think it's just hanging off the mantle of the fireplace. But

363
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 she has this place in her home. If Tony couldn't be part of her

364
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 life in life,

365
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 she was going to make sure he always had a place now that he'd passed on.

366
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 He would have a home now with her.

367
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But this is so, this is such a bizarre

368
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 story. This is such a bizarre story. And I, this

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 okay, let me let me finish this up because I, I

370
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 interpret this story completely different than Sheila does.

371
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And one of these versions, okay, let's get it, let's get into

372
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 this. He passed away in fall of 2021.

373
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 There's been this urn of his ashes and his jersey

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 in Sheila's house probably shortly after that, right? He probably wasn't in some storage center,

375
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 but I don't know, maybe she did recently get the urn and the jersey. She doesn't say

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 but anyways. I like how the beginning is all this touching

377
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 melodrama where I'm really kind of trying to lay the brow

378
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 work where how tormented this young man must have been. And now I can't

379
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 say a sentence without giggling because this is just so weird.

380
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I kind of gave it away in the intro, but let's get, let's get to this.

381
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So Sheila's married now. She was married for the past couple

382
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 months when her husband, well I don't think this

383
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 happens every single time. But it might

384
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 because it just says when her husband is walking

385
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 near the urn,

386
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 he will hear an ear

387
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 splittingly loud

388
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 scream.

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And he can clearly tell it's the sound of a man

390
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 screaming, which I'll tell you is 10

391
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 times more terrifying than a woman screaming.

392
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Because we've been desensitized to the scream of a woman through horror movies

393
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and when women get really excited they scream right in your ear even though

394
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 you're literally like six inches away from them.

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 You basically have to start tuning it out at a certain

396
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 point. But when's the last time you heard in real life

397
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 a man scream? When's the last time you heard in a movie

398
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 a man scream?

399
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It's incredibly terrifying. When you hear a man

400
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 scream, something's seriously wrong.

401
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 It's creepy.

402
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Because you never hear it. You never hear it in media. You never hear it in real life.

403
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 He's walking by this urn and he hears a man

404
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 screaming.

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And it says, look at here, it says

406
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 when the husband is near the items he will randomly hear

407
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 a loud male scream. So it's not every single time. Because otherwise you would just be like, okay

408
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I won't walk near that. He's all super thirsty.

409
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 He's all dehydrated. And Sheila puts out a little mini fridge

410
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 of water. She's like, oh, she's caring to do that. She's like, oh wait, my arms are

411
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 tired. I'm going to set it right by this urn. The husband's like, no

412
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 he's all wearing earplugs. So it doesn't happen every single

413
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 time. But randomly he hears the sound of a male

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 screaming at the top of his lungs

415
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 right in his ear.

416
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Obviously terrifies this poor husband. It would be

417
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 the scariest thing. Now I'm saying

418
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 if I was at your house and I heard a disembodied woman scream, it's not like I would be like

419
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I'm used to that. It would still kind of put me on edge if I heard a woman screaming

420
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 in my own house and there was no reason, there was no woman here. There's no reason

421
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 for me to hear it. That would obviously be upsetting. I'm not

422
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 saying I'd be okay with that. But there is something different

423
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 when you hear a man scream because you never hear it. And if a man

424
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 screaming in your ear, that's even worse. And if the

425
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 man is dead, it's a ghost.

426
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 It's a ghost screaming at the husband.

427
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And this is so interesting to me because I read this story and she goes, yeah, my husband's

428
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 completely terrified about this. I don't know what it is

429
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 but she says, I think it's my brother. I think it's my brother trying to

430
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 communicate with me.

431
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Sheila goes, I think my brother's trying to communicate with me. She went

432
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 because her husband just heard this the other day before she posted this.

433
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 She says, I went over to the urn and I said all the

434
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 things I've been wanting to say to him. All the

435
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 stuff that I've wanted to tell Tony before he died and

436
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 now that he's died, I needed to get all this stuff off my chest. I needed him to

437
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 hear it and I needed to hear myself say it.

438
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And I'm just sobbing and I have a good cry over this whole thing but I needed

439
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 to get all this stuff off my chest and I needed him to know this.

440
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 And she said, I felt really good after I did it. It felt

441
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 so good to let all that emotion out.

442
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And she says, if

443
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 this is his way of letting me know he wants to talk to me,

444
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I will talk more often. I will visit the

445
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 urn on a regular basis and have these conversations

446
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 with my brother.

447
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And she titled this post, I think my

448
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 dead brother is trying to communicate with me.

449
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And that's how she sees this story. She sees it as

450
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 a message.

451
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 But I don't, this is, okay, so I'm going to be totally honest.

452
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 This is, I talked recently about

453
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 if somebody tells me that they had

454
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 a dream that a loved one, a loved one had recently passed and they had a dream and they

455
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 came to him and said, I love you. I wanted to say I love

456
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 you one more time and I hope you have a good life and all that stuff and

457
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 they fade away. I don't discount those ghost stories.

458
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I won't ever say, I don't believe that happened.

459
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 If someone tells me, if someone's personally talking to me about a ghost story,

460
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 where they saw a loved one standing at the end of a hallway,

461
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 don't worry about me, Jimmy, there's nothing but a lot of fish to catch on the other side.

462
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Don't worry about me, old grandpa Chuck.

463
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 I'll be catching fish forever and they fade away.

464
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 I'm not going to be like, well, did you check your carbon monoxide detector? I think you

465
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 actually have been hallucinating. For a couple reasons. One, I believe in

466
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 ghosts, but I even know people who don't believe in ghosts who don't invalidate

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 those stories because that's a very, that's a deeply personal story.

468
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 You're not going to be like, well, that was just a trick of the light. Your grandpa is

469
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 rotting in a grave somewhere and the worms are eating him. Maybe someday a fish will

470
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 eat that worm, but you're making that up or you're mentally

471
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 ill. And with this

472
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 story, it's a tricky one because I don't,

473
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I love that she was able to get all this stuff

474
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 off of her chest. I love that she was able to talk

475
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 to Tony. That's heartwarming and it was definitely needed. If not

476
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 for Tony for Sheila, she needed to say this stuff out loud. I totally

477
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 understand that. As a paranormal

478
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 researcher, my take is, and here's the thing,

479
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 who cares about my take? Right? Who cares? My take

480
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 is, I read something online and I'm giving my opinion. If I'm wrong,

481
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 that's totally fine. She doesn't have to believe in anything I'm about to say,

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 but I will say this.

483
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 This is pretty creepy, the fact that her husband

484
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 is hearing the screaming, that it

485
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 manifests as a screaming.

486
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 If Sheila takes this,

487
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 takes the fact that her husband is having a man scream in her

488
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 ear as the ghost trying to

489
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 communicate with her, I just

490
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 don't. I'm glad that she was able to get this stuff off of

491
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 her chest, but I don't know if that's what this voice actually wants.

492
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 You know what I mean?

493
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 It's such an interesting

494
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 grief is complicated.

495
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Grief is incredibly complicated, and it's such a horrible emotion to go

496
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 through, and it's necessary. It's part of the human condition, but

497
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 I'm not saying that she's wrong,

498
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 but listen man,

499
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 there are two types of ghosts. We talk all about different types of paranormal phenomenon,

500
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 and at the end of the day, there's two types.

501
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 They're scary and not scary.

502
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 On a basic level, if you woke up in the middle of the

503
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 night and your grandpa's standing at the end of the hallway, and goes, "Listen Johnny,

504
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 I died, but here I am,

505
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 I'm back from the dead." To tell you, "Don't worry about good old Gramps,

506
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 I'm gonna go fishing."

507
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 Whatever he does, they go fishing no matter what. Some little kid dies.

508
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 He's like, "I guess I'm a fisherman now. I'm gonna go fishing in heaven.

509
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I got the pole. The reach is down from the clouds. I'm gonna get you

510
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 killer whale. I'm an angel. I'm super strong. I can wrestle

511
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 giant squids. I'm gonna kill a couple of those tonight. It's dead. That's awesome.

512
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Johnny, you should try it. Join me. Join me on the other side.

513
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 See, that's the difference between...

514
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 basically a non-scary ghost that turned into a bad ghost.

515
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 I kinda ruined my own example. What I'm saying is if you woke up in the middle of the night and you saw a ghost of a

516
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 dead loved one, that is on just a basic level creepy.

517
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 That's scary. You wake up and you see your dead

518
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 relative standing at the edge of your bed. But then they say,

519
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 "I'm trying not to make any jokes this time. I wanna have a good example."

520
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 You wake up, there's a dead relative at the edge of your bed and they go,

521
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 "I'm on the other side now. Everything's perfect."

522
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 What? Mom, you never fished? She's like, "I do now."

523
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Ghosts in and of themselves are spooky,

524
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 but when you sit back and think about the ghost, you go, "Well, that ghost wasn't trying

525
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 to scare me." Yes, it is scary to think that while I'm sleeping

526
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 there's someone standing over my bed. That's just creepy

527
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 in general, but then when you wake up and realize they just wanna go fishing,

528
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 that's not spooky. And then if you woke up in the middle of the night

529
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 and there was a ghost at the edge of your bed, but it was like a little girl. You don't know any little girls

530
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 who've died recently. And you just see the top of her head, she's kind of like

531
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 ducked down. So you look at the foot of your bed and you see like a top of

532
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 little girl's head and then she slowly is like rising up and her

533
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 eyeballs are gone. Just dark sockets staring at you.

534
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And she starts going like, "Wring around the

535
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 blue rose." That's a scary ghost. That's scary

536
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 even if you didn't know a little girl who died recently.

537
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 Even if your niece died in a horrible fishing related

538
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 accident, she was super weird. A giant killer whale

539
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 got sucked out of the ocean and flew into the clouds, knocked over this boat, killed this little girl.

540
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Even if you knew a little girl who died, even if she was a relative

541
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 of yours, she doesn't need to be hiding the edge of your bed singing nursery rhymes

542
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 with no eyeballs. There's scary ghosts and there's not scary ghosts. Even though

543
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 ghosts in and of themselves are scary, some act in scary ways.

544
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 For example, screaming. For example, screaming.

545
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Right in somebody's ear at the top of their lungs. That's spooky.

546
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 That's a terrifying manifestation

547
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 of a spirit. It's

548
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 such an interesting sort of like, what is the phenomenon that's going on here? Why is it

549
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 only affecting the husband? And here's my take. We got to

550
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 wrap this up because I'll go on for hours about this thing. I find this so interesting but

551
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 what I think is interesting is that I'm trying to think. There was

552
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 a story or stories that I've read in the past. This is all starting

553
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 and I've just done so much reading over the decades about this stuff.

554
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Where at a certain point, Sheila is going to have to think

555
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 if the ghost of my brother is screaming

556
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 in my husband's ear,

557
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 there might be something wrong with my husband.

558
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 I don't know if we've ever covered a story like that on the

559
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 podcast. We might have. One of you guys will remember if we did.

560
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 But I've come across stuff like that in the literature, in the lore over the years.

561
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Where a ghost is trying to warn the living about

562
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 threats of other people who are still alive.

563
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 That's what I'm thinking. Here's the thing. This is either a good ghost

564
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 appearing in a scary way to scare the husband off

565
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 or this is a bad ghost

566
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 slowly beginning to manifest until this couple's lives.

567
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 I guess there's a third

568
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 one where this actually is the spirit of Tony and for whatever

569
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 reason he can't communicate directly with Sheila. He can only

570
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 communicate and screams from beyond.

571
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 It's possible. The world is paranormal

572
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 anything is possible but I'm kind of leaning towards the fact that

573
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 this is either Tony trying to ward off the husband. He knows something

574
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 that Sheila doesn't know. Or that this is some sort

575
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 of malevolent spirit

576
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 that is slowly taking shape in this house. Tony may be off

577
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 in paradise already. Tony may have passed away and moved on.

578
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 This is something using that grief and that anger

579
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 and it's after Sheila.

580
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 It's coming after Sheila and that's why it's manifesting as

581
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 this scream. Because it is a dark force.

582
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Fascinating. Super fascinating story. I mean this was

583
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 just posted not too long ago. We are

584
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 knee deep in this phenomenon. It was posted about 16 days ago

585
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 from now. It was posted on January 20th. So most likely we'll never

586
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 hear an update. Whether it's good or bad it will probably

587
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 won't see an update pop up later.

588
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 People just kind of go on with their lives. If stuff starts to get dark it's not like

589
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 she's going to run to the internet and be like oh I have to leave stuff floating around her keyboard

590
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 and she's like hey I'm trying to post here. I mean stuff would have to get really bad

591
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 for her to do an update. Most of the stuff she's just posting on random

592
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 stuff online. I would be super cautious but again what are you going to

593
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 do? I mean I think if you're husband I don't think earplugs are actually going to help.

594
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 It's a scream from beyond the grave. But do you move

595
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 the urn? Do you move it out of the way so it doesn't have to walk by it so much?

596
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Disrespect the remains to respect your husband.

597
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 I don't know it's a super interesting case

598
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 and we don't know which direction it's going to go and we

599
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 don't know how this is going to play out because it's happening right now.

600
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 As you're listening to this episode in the comfort of your own home or car there's

601
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 a man somewhere held by a ghost

602
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 by the ghost of a dead brother. And is it a playful

603
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 yell? Is it trying to get attention so he can talk to Sheila or is it

604
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 a scream of the pain that this husband

605
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 will see you endure himself? Who knows it's such a fascinating

606
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 ghost story and a perfect way to end this week.

607
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 And one more treat for you guys.
