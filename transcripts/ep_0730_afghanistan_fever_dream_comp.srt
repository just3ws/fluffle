1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Did the Vatican try hiding proof that holy icons can be possessed by the devil?

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,240
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who almost dies and has a vision of his death today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:28,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,240
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a bunch of stuff to get started with.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,600
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Give it up for Joe S.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,720
 Everyone give a round of applause to Joe S. He's walking on in. He's tumbling into Dead Rabbit Command.

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,840
 Joe, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,600
 Just help spread the word about the show. You guys have no idea how much that means. Word of mouth is king

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,200
 with podcasts. So I need you guys telling people about it. Talk about it online. Talk about it to your friends.

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,080
 It really, really is important to spread the word about the show. Joe S. I'm going to go ahead and tash the oars to the Dead Rabbit

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,400
 Robo. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are sailing all the way out to Milan, Italy.

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,040
 Splishity splash. Splishity splash. Those are the oars in the water. I realized the other day

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 I don't really have a sound effect for the Dead Rabbit Robo. That's the sound of the oars hitting the water. Splishity splash.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
 And as we're sailing out there, first off, let's go ahead. I want to issue a

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,120
 update. A Dead Rabbit Radio update. Breaking update. Episode 676. I had an episode called "He Tested His Time Machine On Himself."

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,000
 It was the story of Mike Madman Markham. It was a great episode. It's one of my

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,840
 favorite recent episodes. I really, really love that one. But in that episode, I made a claim

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,440
 that a Minecraft game was haunted by a third player. And it was about how open world games themselves

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,400
 are kind of spooky and who knows what's going on in the programming. And what happened was I was watching

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,520
 "Fruitberries vs. Illumina." I know your eyes are glazing over. Just like whenever your nephew talks to you about Minecraft.

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,000
 But "Fruitberries vs. Illumina" are two of the best Minecraft players in the world. They're fighting each other.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And I saw a third player in there. Even one of them, I think it was Illumina, turned and looked and go,

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,640
 "Hey, are you over there?" Like it tricked him. And I had this segment about who knows what's going on in the background of these open world.

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,840
 And I still stand by that. We don't know what goes on in the open worlds. But this mystery has been solved thanks to Corey NJ.

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,200
 I thought it was a third player in Enchanted Armor jumping into a lake.

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
 It turns out it was a dolphin.

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,320
 You're like, "Jason, Jason, how did you... how did you confuse a dolphin with a man in whatever armor you said?"

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,000
 Well, it's easy to confuse. Like even Corey NJ, they said they'd been playing the game since beta.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,240
 They said they slowed it down and they magnified it and they were able to see it. And once Corey NJ said that,

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,200
 I went back and rewatched it and yes. So I wanted to make that correction. I wanted to make that update.

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,440
 That was a claim I was making specifically. Every show often I'll cover stories and the episode will be out.

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,880
 Sometimes there might be a slight alteration to the news.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,160
 Like Church Going Mule. I covered a story recently about a guy banging a donkey in El Salvador and he gave birth to another donkey.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 Church Going Mule did some more research on it and he goes,

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,480
 "This seems to be a story that's floating around in Spanish-speaking countries." He goes, "When I looked for it in Spanish newspapers,

36
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,960
 there was like a story that said it happened in Argentina. There was a story that said it happened in Mexico,

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,800
 I believe it, and people were saying it was a hoax and stuff like that. That was a story.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 I wasn't going to stop the press as an announcement. The story about the half human half donkey

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,240
 may not have happened in El Salvador. It seems the photos are real, but we don't know the origin of the photos.

40
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
 But when I make a claim,

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,520
 when I make a claim and that was my conspiracy theory, I definitely wanted to come forward and go,

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,480
 there's new evidence and that particular instance

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
 is not,

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,880
 it's a dolphin. It is a dolphin. If we can make a shirt that just says it's a dolphin

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,480
 and that'll be in the Ted Rabbit store soon enough,

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,920
 we have to own our mistakes. I don't really know if I would say this was, I guess it was a mistake.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 I did think it was a man in armor and it was a dolphin, but I think it's so important

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,640
 for Paranormal and also I'd recently talked about the Dibbock box and Zach Baggins and you have to come forward and say,

49
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,880
 you have to come forward and go, I had a belief

50
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,880
 this is a mild one. That's the great thing about putting out a daily podcast, honestly.

51
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,400
 If I spent weeks and weeks and weeks putting together shows

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,680
 and I had a 30 minute video that was super slick and then someone goes, oh, excuse me, no, that's not real,

53
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,920
 it'd be much harder for you to back down because you spent so much time making that for me.

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,920
 I'm putting together daily content. So when people go, that's not real, which doesn't happen that often, honestly.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,400
 I mean, people may quibble. Like, I have this guy telling me that I should drink my own pee.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,240
 He's doing it right now. He's knocking on my door trying to give me drink pee. On an episode I did a long time ago about Ormus.

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
 He keeps messaging.

58
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
 I wouldn't say keeps. He's left like two or three comments, but he's like, you don't know what you're talking about.

59
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
 Pee's good for you and all that. I'll put that episode in the show notes, but

60
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,920
 if you're watching this and have no idea what you're talking about, but

61
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
 I'll get people will try calling me out on stuff like that, but if and they're wrong, but I'm not going to drink my pee.

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,200
 But on a situation like this where I make the claim, I need to come forward and say

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,080
 I was wrong and I wish more paranormal people would do this.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
 When you're putting out an episode once a day, it does help because I don't have a horse in this.

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,440
 I don't have a dolphin in this fight. But again, thank you, Corey and Jay for

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
 checking that out and church going mule as well for doing more research.

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,840
 But El Salvador will always have the donkey boy in my heart.

68
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,120
 We're rolling on out to Milan. We're specifically headed to Portonari Chapel.

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,920
 That's in the Basilica of Saint Eustegorio in Milan.

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,680
 Now everyone shh, quit laughing at my mispronunciations. We're walking into the tomb

71
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,320
 of a saint. This story was sent to me by Dead Rabbit Radio Listener, Sad Paperclip. This was great.

72
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,880
 It's funny. This is actually a good segue. It's a follow-up to an episode I did

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,320
 called "Can Demons Disguise Themselves as Holy Icons?" It was the end of season 14.

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,520
 But you don't have to listen to that episode to get the context of this. It's exactly what it sounds

75
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,800
 like. The question was, is can demons or dark forces disguise themselves as holy figures?

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
 And just a quick overview, that one had three, if I remember correctly, three girls in Russia,

77
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,080
 Eastern Europe, running away from the Virgin Mary who seemed a little menacing and she was

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,040
 like floating after them and then she was like standing, just standing creepily at their neighbor's

79
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,800
 house, just watching them from the distance. And the question was, is could a demon disguise itself

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,360
 as a virgin Mary? And Sad Paperclip sent me this article and basically said, "Yeah, I think it could."

81
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,040
 I've actually got a lot of really good feedback on that episode. That's another one of my recent

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,320
 favorite episodes. But he sent me this story. We're in the Tomb of the Saint. And this is the tomb

83
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,040
 of Saint Peter Martyr. That's setting your kid up. Like, why would your last name be Martyr?

84
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,200
 Right? Then you're just asking him, that'd be like me having a kid and being like,

85
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,560
 you're now Johnny Suicide Bomber. He's like, why can't I do something else? Like, no. Hang out with

86
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,200
 your sister Suzy Patient Zero. Like, you're setting them up, you know how they're gonna die. They're

87
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,760
 gonna be martyred. So Peter Martyr, this is the 13th century. He's an Italian Catholic priest.

88
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,880
 And he's actually like super controversial. Well, the Catholics love him. The Catholics love him

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,280
 today. He's a saint. But back then, the people around town are like, we don't know about you,

90
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
 bro. Because what? Your name's Martyr. So we assume you're gonna die super violently. No one wants

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,760
 to hang out with him. He's like, hey, what's hanging out in my house and play some cards? You're like,

92
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,200
 uh, I don't know. Today might be the day you like burst into flames or someone ties you to a catapult.

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,040
 You're gonna get martyred, bro. He was controversial because you have this breakaway set of Christianity

94
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,200
 called the Cathars. Basically Catholics are like, you guys, we'd rather hang out with witches

95
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,840
 than you guys. Now 13th century is the Inquisition time. So they are hanging out with the witches

96
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,560
 because they're torturing them. But the Cathars were up on the Inquisition list as well because the

97
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,160
 Cathars believe, and I know history majors are pulling their hair out every time I mispronounce

98
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,680
 something. But the Cathars believe in the duality of God, as in there's two of them. It's not this

99
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,600
 monotheism, the Catholicism's practicing. They believe that the God of the New Testament is

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,520
 different than the God of the Old Testament. The God of the New Testament is a good guy because

101
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,520
 he's like, yeah, it doesn't matter what you do. It doesn't matter if you're a Jew or a Gentile,

102
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,960
 if you're a sinner, like I still got love for you, homie. Like all this stuff in Jesus represents

103
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,280
 that. He's like, yeah, I don't care about what you did. I mean, like quit sitting right now in front

104
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,440
 of me. But I love you. I love you. You too. You're selling stuff in the synagogue. I'm going to beat

105
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,680
 you up. But at the end of the day, I love you, bros. The God of the Old Testament does seem like

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,520
 a different guy because he's like, your hair, you cut your hair, and you're going to hell. Oh,

107
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,080
 you got that tattoo on your arm. Sorry, bro. Like he's pretty, pretty brutal. Now, it is different

108
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,520
 time periods. It is totally different time periods, but he does have a character. God

109
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,080
 does have an interesting character arc through the Bible. But the Cathars believe that the God of

110
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
 the Old Testament is a totally different guy. It's not a character arc. It's not someone who grows.

111
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,560
 It's a dude named Rex Mundy, which means king of the world. It's actually like a separate individual.

112
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,280
 And they also believe like Jesus was not corporeal, that he was like a ghost floating around. He's like

113
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,720
 caspering it all over the Holy Land. They were basically saying stuff specifically to mess with

114
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,840
 the Catholics, but they believed it. The Catholics were getting so mad at them. They're like, you

115
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,040
 know what? We've perfected all this torture with these witches. Why don't we use this on these Cathars?

116
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,480
 And first, first way we'll torture them is by mispronouncing their name. They're like,

117
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,360
 so, so Peter Martyr was this Italian Catholic priest and he was constantly in conflict with

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,800
 these Cathars in this area. And the Cathars are like, dude, this dude totally sucks. Let's take

119
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,480
 care of him. Let's make his last name finally mean something. So one day he's walking down the street

120
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,960
 and a dude runs up behind him with an axe and hits him on the head so hard. This is the thing. Okay,

121
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,120
 let me pause it right here. A little bit of dramatic pause. I used to work in a morgue. And one of the

122
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,360
 first things you realize when you're around a lot of dead bodies is that people do not die in movie

123
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,280
 type ways. Like when people get shot in movies, they go, oh, and they kind of fall down. There's

124
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,760
 an awful lot of gurgling. There's an awful lot of gurgling involved when people die. A lot of

125
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 noises, a lot of smells. And it's not like when you hit someone with an axe on the head, it doesn't

126
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,080
 get stuck in the, I mean, these things can happen. You get stuck in the head or the head goes flying

127
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,560
 off and then winks at a sexy lady is it rolling along the ground? No, there's a, the human head is

128
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,680
 a, is a ball, right? It's like a oval type thing and an axe comes to a point. So if you're running

129
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,080
 up behind someone and you're going to chop their head off or put an axe in your head, there's a

130
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:38,080
 lot of things that can go wrong or right. The assailant takes the axe and hits Peter's head and

131
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:47,840
 cuts off just a piece of his brain. I mean, there's no, it's 13th century Italy. That's a, you're dead.

132
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,680
 But not immediately. Like it's not so dramatic that he's able to, he chops off a chunk of skull

133
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,720
 and a bit of brain go fly. You're like, Jason, damn it. Dude, that's so gross. I know, I know.

134
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,080
 The, the axe just chops off. Imagine if all of a sudden you lost one tenth of your brain.

135
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,280
 Like you look and it's laying on the ground. You'd probably freak out. I'd probably freak out. I

136
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,400
 think anyone freak out. But Peter martyr, he takes his blow to his head, probably about 10,

137
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,080
 20% of his brain goes flying out and he immediately begins this thing called the Apostles Creed,

138
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,120
 which is the Bible version of Assassin's Creed. It's that lame game, the one you played at

139
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,480
 vacation Bible school. He begins saying, I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and

140
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
 earth. And as he's doing the Apostles Creed, the other guys like, damn it, dude, why'd you have to

141
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,000
 just chop off part of his brain and he gets stabbed and it still takes some like four or five days to

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,840
 die. So this point, Peter martyr is actually the fastest person to go from death to sainthood. It's

143
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,200
 11 months from the time he died to the time he became a saint. And when you look, I didn't know

144
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,960
 this. So I guess this kind of makes sense. When you look at pictures of Jesus, he's crucified,

145
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,600
 not all the time. Sometimes he's like walking around talking to people, but a lot of times,

146
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,480
 especially in Catholicism, he's on the cross. I didn't know this was a thing, but apparently

147
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 in Catholicism, the saints are drawn with the martyr, you know, the martyred saints are drawn

148
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,520
 with the way they're dead. I didn't know this was a thing, because if you look at a pain,

149
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:35,440
 it's horrifying. This is so horrifying. If you look at paintings of Saint now Saint Peter martyr,

150
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:43,600
 there's an axe in his head and a knife through his chest. And he's like talking to baby Jesus.

151
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,560
 It's so bizarre. I mean, I'm not trying, I mean, I guess I know I know I've lost every Catholic

152
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,680
 listener. I'm not trying to be insulting. I just didn't know there was a thing. Like it's super

153
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,920
 disturbing. And because he died, because this article said because he died of two different

154
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
 ways, they're both included. And it's almost, it doesn't look like an axe. It looks like if you

155
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,040
 had a paper cutter at work, and then you took the bolt off, and then you stuck that in someone's

156
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,960
 head, that it's like this giant cleaver. And then he has a knife in them. There's a painting of him

157
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,960
 talking to Jesus. But that's not why we're here. That's not why that's all incredibly fascinating.

158
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,760
 That's not why we're here. So Portanari Chapel is the tomb of Saint Peter martyr. And they have

159
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,200
 all these frescoes and all these paintings. And you can go there, you pay a couple lira,

160
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,720
 and you walk around. It's a great little experience. But in 1952, they were doing some sort of

161
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,960
 renovation, and they were working on something, and they began to chip away at the plaster on this

162
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:50,240
 wall. And they found a painting, a fresco, from 1468 that had been covered up. They didn't know

163
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
 who knew it was there. It had been covered up for hundreds of years at this point.

164
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,200
 And they take all the plaster off, and they do restoration of the painting. And it was painted

165
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,120
 by Renaissance master. Wasn't just some Guy Graffiti artist there. Vincenzo Fappa painted this.

166
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,960
 And it's the painting of Saint Peter that he did no acts in his head at this point. And he's

167
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:19,040
 standing around a bunch of other people. And in front of him is the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus,

168
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,640
 both of them with devil horns. So that's what the sat paper clip sent me. He goes,

169
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:34,640
 you know, there's a story about Saint Peter. He exercised the devil from a statue of Mary.

170
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,480
 And the name of this painting is Saint Peter martyr, exercising a demon possessed statue of

171
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
 the Virgin and child. But there was no info on like the articles I was reading about it. They

172
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,840
 said we know when it was painted or around the time period, we know it was covered up. But we

173
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,360
 don't really know what event this was relating to. And whenever I searched for this, it kept bringing

174
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,520
 up stories about the plaster and this painting. But I couldn't find any event of when he showed

175
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,760
 up and when he exercised the devil from the statue. I was looking, I'm looking, I'm looking,

176
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,240
 I'm looking, I was about to give up. I came across an Atlas Obscura article. It wasn't a statue.

177
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:21,280
 Check this out. This is this is the story. Saint Peter finds out that this man who was previously

178
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,200
 Catholic had joined the Cathars. And he's like, dang it, dude, now I got to go and reconvert them

179
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,960
 or deconvert them. However it is. He goes, listen, you got to be a Catholic again. This is no good

180
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:39,440
 news. Why are why are you even toying with this idea of being a cathar? And the friend of his goes,

181
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,640
 dude, you won't believe it. I went and I was hanging out with these other cathar people.

182
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,720
 And the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus showed up. Like I go to your church all the time. I never

183
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,760
 seen none of that stuff, but I saw her and little baby Jesus. So who, what would you do? Now Saint

184
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,000
 Peter goes, this has to be a setup, right? This can't be real because I know that the Blessed

185
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,600
 Virgin Mary and baby Jesus is on our side. So he goes, you know, I'll go with you. I want to see

186
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
 this vision for myself. So he goes and he's hanging out with his buddy and all these other cathars

187
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,680
 are standing around in this area and the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus show up. And Saint Peter's

188
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,440
 looking at him and it goes, you guys, this is it? This is what they're like, yeah, that's, that's,

189
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,120
 you can see that, right? He's like, oh no, I totally see it. That's, that's the Virgin Mary and

190
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,480
 and little baby Jesus. But you guys see the other thing, right? And what Saint Peter realized,

191
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:46,320
 no one else could see this, both Mary and Jesus had devil horns. So he knows this is not the

192
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,080
 real Blessed Virgin Mary, but the cathars are like, no, no, no, they don't see the horns. No, no,

193
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,160
 no, this is actual vision. So what he does is he has some sacramental bread on him and he asks the

194
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,400
 Virgin Mary, well, this is his quote, if you're the mother of God, adore your son, unquote. He

195
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,080
 wanted her to take the sacrament, which is the bread supposed to symbolize the flesh of Jesus

196
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,480
 and you eat it and gives her the piece of bread to eat to take that sacrament and she won't because

197
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,440
 it's the devil and she runs away. And all of the cathars there realize that this not, this was not

198
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,720
 the Blessed Virgin Mary, it was actually the devil and they all immediately become Catholic again.

199
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,280
 It's an interesting story. I was only able to find one source of it that when I was reading

200
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,040
 articles about the painting, it would refer me to a book that was like $50. The ebook version was

201
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,320
 $50. It's normally like $150. It was talking about the life of Saint Peter. So it's possible

202
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,280
 that Atlas Obscura got this from the book, but I couldn't afford the book to verify it.

203
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,440
 But it's more information than what we were getting with everything else, which was basically like,

204
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,400
 I don't know. There's this painting that they found that had the Virgin Mary and it would make

205
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,000
 sense if the context of it was lost over time. If this story became limited over time, I'm not

206
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,400
 saying they had to buy the ebook back in the 1500s, but if over time, if the story was so rare,

207
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,960
 I could only find one source of it and everyone else just said it's a painting. We think it's this.

208
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,320
 It would make sense that when people are going to visit the tomb, out of context, the picture of

209
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,480
 the Blessed Virgin Mary and baby Jesus with devil horns would make no sense. And it's possible that

210
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,360
 there were probably people working in that chapel who were completely unfamiliar with this story.

211
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
 And if they couldn't explain it, it just became the story of, I don't know, and then eventually

212
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,120
 they just said, "Paint it over. I'm tired of not being able to answer questions." And then over

213
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,640
 the centuries, people just forgot about it altogether. But a fascinating story and one more

214
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,800
 piece of the puzzle, it does seem like the forces of evil can disguise themselves as

215
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,680
 holy icons. Not only can they, it seems like they do it quite often. So then you have to sit back

216
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:17,280
 and wonder how many visions from God are actually visions from the devil. I remember one thing I

217
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,240
 heard really early on. I was probably in middle school and my dad was a minister before he owned

218
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,920
 a morgue. But I remember one thing I learned really early on, middle school when I was going to church,

219
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,280
 the devil hears your prayers too. I thought it was really spooky because you may really want

220
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,840
 something, you may really want something to happen, and the devil may give it to you, knowing

221
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,640
 that is not the path you should be going down. So thank you so much for that story,

222
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,480
 sad paperclip. Again, it's very, very cool and creepy addition to the saga of Canary religious

223
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,960
 icons really be devils in disguise. Joe S, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys of the

224
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,920
 Carbinder Coptor. We are leaving behind Italy. We are headed on out to Jolly Old England.

225
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:13,520
 Joe's flying us over the quaint little households of England. This is one of those stories where we

226
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,760
 don't have a name. This is anonymous story. So we're going to call this guy Paul. And we don't

227
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,320
 really have a time period for when the story starts as well. Mid 80s maybe. So we have some real

228
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,080
 wiggly stuff in the beginning, but I think the story builds to a point that it's definitely

229
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,720
 worth telling and examining. We're in England and there's a little eight year old boy we're going

230
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,600
 to call him Paul. He has a terrible fever. And he's rolling around in his bed. His parents are

231
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,840
 like, we don't know what to do. We tried everything. And his parents are super worried. I mean,

232
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 this kid is burning up and they call 999. That's the emergency phone line over in England and

233
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,920
 Wales and stuff like that. And they're like, listen, here's what you need to do. Get a bathtub,

234
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,800
 get the coldest water possible, throw some ice cubes in it and dunk your kid in the bathtub.

235
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,160
 I don't know if that's the best advice. I don't know if they just going to send an ambulance out

236
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,360
 there, but that's their first advice. So the parents draw the really cold bathtub, fill a full

237
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,080
 ice, pick up a little Paul and submerge him into this ice cold water. And Paul says, I remember

238
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:27,360
 originally I just felt freezing cold, freezing cold. But when they submerged my body into the water,

239
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,120
 I was engulfed in flames. I felt just every pore of my body was just burning hot.

240
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,840
 And I instantly went unconscious. He says I felt a pop in the center of my brain.

241
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:50,880
 And then my eyes open, but not his physical eyes. He's floating above his body. He can

242
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,920
 feel himself completely disconnected from his little tiny body submerged in the ice cold bath.

243
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:04,000
 And he's looking up at what should be the ceiling of the bathroom. But what he really sees as a

244
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 vast unending desert. And he's looking at this landscape and he goes, it looked like Mars.

245
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,520
 So the only thing his little eight year old brain could compare it to. I thought I was on Mars.

246
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:22,640
 He's looking at this unending horizon and then he hears a click. And not too far off in the distance,

247
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:33,280
 he sees an explosion. And he's just watching flame and smoke dance in the middle of this desert.

248
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,440
 And he's watching it for what seems like hours. He feels another pop. And the next thing he knows,

249
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,040
 he's back in his body. He's still in the bathtub. And he has then rushed to the hospital. He said

250
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,280
 he had a really bad flu. He had the worst fever. They took him to the emergency room.

251
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,720
 Jump ahead to the year 2006, Afghanistan.

252
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,000
 Paul is in a Humvee along with fellow soldiers. They're driving down a pre designated road.

253
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,640
 This is a road that the military has said this is as safe as it's going to get.

254
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,480
 This place is swept for IEDs. There's none out here. You can travel down this road with relatives.

255
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,040
 He says we're driving down this road. And I can't explain it. But I tell the driver, stop.

256
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,920
 Driver looks at him, stops. What's going on? What's going on, Paul? Paul sits there and he looks out

257
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,720
 at this landscape. He goes, there's a bomb on that road right in front of us. There's a bomb over there.

258
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:47,040
 It's an interesting thing. I imagine soldiers would be extremely superstitious people.

259
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,240
 You'd have those rituals that you did on that certain day. You tied your shoes

260
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,200
 first left foot, then your right foot, and that's the day that the bullet hit your helmet.

261
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,640
 It should have killed you. But it was a miracle that it didn't. So you always put your shoes on that

262
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
 way. I imagine that soldiers are very, very superstitious people. So you're driving on this

263
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,720
 road that you know is constantly swept for IEDs. There's not an IED on this road. This is a

264
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,200
 pre designated road. It's always swept. And if any places this should be the safest. But when

265
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,080
 someone says, stop the car. I have a funny feeling about this road. You're going to stop the car.

266
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:34,000
 He goes, there's an IED up there. And he says they got out, cautiously approached the area.

267
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,120
 There they see a freshly placed improvised explosive device.

268
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,440
 He said it was big enough that it would have completely vaporized the vehicle. They would

269
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:55,120
 have all been dead. And when they discover the IED, they call it in to get it diffused.

270
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:03,440
 He's sitting in that Humvee and he remembers that night floating out of his body as a child.

271
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,640
 He can't explain what happened or how it happened. But he knows that vision

272
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:22,720
 he had as a child was his death as an adult. Fascinating, fascinating story. This is one

273
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,160
 of those stories where you just kind of sit back and go, what happened? Like the connection between

274
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,000
 the two events almost dying and seeing his death. And so it's just to me, it's one of those stories.

275
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,080
 I read it and I immediately was like, I got to tell you guys about this story. I got to tell you

276
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,320
 guys about this story because it makes no sense and it makes all the sense. Makes no sense as to

277
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:54,160
 how it could have happened. But it makes sense that what if when we're at the edge of death,

278
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:01,600
 where we're about to push through that veil, we see all deaths. I don't know. I mean, I could

279
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,800
 almost hypothesize about it just over and over again. But it's like, he was, because he saw his

280
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,200
 own death. It's not like he saw himself get warned. He's almost dying as a kid. He sees his death in

281
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 the future. But he's able to prevent that from his vision as a kid. If he didn't have that fever,

282
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,760
 they would have driven right over that IED. Not only did he save his own life,

283
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,120
 but he saved the lives of the other men. Did the other men in that vehicle have dreams when

284
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,280
 they were children? Maybe not the extreme fever, but maybe just a normal dream that they forgot.

285
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,520
 They woke up and they never remembered. How was he warned? Did the fever

286
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,880
 spark something in his brain that allowed him to see through time? And this story has,

287
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,640
 I mean, what if the driver wasn't superstitious or Paul didn't speak up? He's thinking, I don't

288
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,680
 want to be a weirdo. Like, maybe I'm just, or maybe he was distracted that day.

289
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,720
 And he wasn't thinking back to that childhood memory. How many times have we not followed our

290
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,360
 gut instinct? Now, a lot of times I have a gut instinct to not fly on a plane. Every time I get

291
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
 on a plane, I don't like, oh man, this is the time that plane's going to go down. And I start to get

292
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,800
 a little panicked and then I just go out, screw it. And I just put on my headphones and start

293
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,000
 listening to letters to Cleo or something and then just ignore it all. But, and it's never happened,

294
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,080
 right? So, I mean, his gut instinct must have been far stronger than that. But what if he ignored it?

295
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,240
 And they got vaporized. He still would have seen his death, but he wouldn't have been alive to tell

296
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,920
 us about it. It's just so fascinating to think the difference between a Humvee full of soldiers

297
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:53,840
 safely making it back to base or ending up as twisted steel and dead bodies. The only difference

298
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,880
 between those two outcomes was the fever dream of an eight-year-old boy, barely clinging to life

299
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,920
 as he saw a vision. And more importantly, listening to that vision.
