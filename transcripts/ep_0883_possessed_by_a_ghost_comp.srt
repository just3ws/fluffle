1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Today, we take a look at two ghost stories that may be two of the most powerful ghosts

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,300
 I've ever come across in over 30 years of research.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:17,200
 First off, is it possible that when a young girl died, her spirit was so powerful, it

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,820
 could be everywhere at once?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,940
 And then we take a look at the story of a young woman who recently lost her father.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,040
 While losing a loved one can always be hard, we hope for proof from beyond that they're

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,000
 still with us.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,080
 But is this father taking things too far?

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,640
 [music]

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,920
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,920
 day too.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,800
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend, whatever you were doing, I hope it was cool.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,960
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is two more people who visited me

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,440
 at the McMinnemins UFO Festival in McMinnville, Oregon.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,400
 I got to meet six of you in total who are long time listeners of the show.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,240
 What a treat for me.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,120
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, give it up for Aaron and Kate.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,200
 Wooo, yeah they're walking in to break dance and bringing out cardboard spinning around.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,560
 You gotta clean that up, clean up that cardboard.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,040
 And while they're done they do a little B-Boy pose in the end.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,960
 That's how we know they're done dancing.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,760
 Aaron and Kate, you're going to be our captains, our pilots this episode.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,280
 If you guys can't support the Patreon if you can't meet me in real life, I'm sure one

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 of those is easier to do than the other.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,960
 That's okay, really is.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,400
 Just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,920
 You have no idea how much that means to me when you guys are out there and telling people

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,840
 about Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,200
 That's really the main driver for whether or not a podcast is successful.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,800
 This podcast is successful because of you guys.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,840
 Oh, and before I go any further, you'll see the artwork for today's episode.

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,480
 You see those cool little buttons?

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
 Kate made those.

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,920
 Kate made those are custom buttons.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,240
 She gave me that set and she gave Sabine.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,720
 Sabine was at the festival as well.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,480
 Gave Sabine a set of the, aren't those awesome?

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,960
 Those are so cool.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,560
 And I would love to give you a link where you could purchase your own.

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,360
 She did that's the Mongolian Death Worm, a great alien and the Loveland Frog, little

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
 cryptid.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,800
 The art style is adorable, everything about it.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,240
 But Kate's store is not online right now.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,800
 There's some things, the feds rated it.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,840
 They're like, you know too much about the Loveland Frog.

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
 You can't buy these out anymore.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
 No.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,120
 And then Kate, when you're hearing this episode, when you do get your store back online, shoot

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 me an email.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
 I'll put a link in and I'll feature your buttons as well.

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
 Fantastic though.

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,800
 I know you guys would love to support her art as well.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,280
 Aaron and Kate, I have matching keys for the Jason Jalopy.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
 Let's go ahead and toss those to you guys.

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,520
 We are driving all the way out to Phoenix, Arizona.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,800
 Driving on out there.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,080
 The reason why we're headed out to Phoenix, Arizona is we have to take a look at, this

62
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,480
 story is crazy.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,640
 Now to be fair, I've done a lot of research and other people have done a lot of research

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,960
 and we can't prove whether or not this story is true.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,080
 This is one of those stories that has a lot of detail to it.

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,880
 But no one's been able to verify whether or not the story is true.

67
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,760
 It may just be an urban legend and may be an actual haunting.

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
 Who knows?

69
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
 But I definitely, definitely an interesting ghost encounter and I've been studying this

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,640
 stuff for near on 30 years at this point.

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,760
 It's August 6th, 1995.

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,560
 We're in Phoenix, Arizona.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
 Right now we're walking down Fifth Avenue and this location is Fifth Avenue.

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,600
 If you're in Phoenix, you can check this out.

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 You may not want to.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 It's kind of spooky.

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,840
 On August 6th, 1995, on Fifth Avenue between Roosevelt and Fillmore Streets.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
 All their streets are named after presidents over there.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,960
 A nine-year-old girl is crossing the street.

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,440
 She's crossing Fifth Avenue.

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,920
 We don't have a name for the girl.

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,040
 It's weird, isn't it?

83
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,960
 We have a specific location.

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,000
 We have a date and all of the events that go on, but we don't have a name for this girl.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
 We're going to go ahead and call her Samantha though.

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:28,840
 Samantha, nine years old, is crossing the street and a car appears out of nowhere.

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
 And it's headed right towards her.

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 The car hits this young girl.

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
 I'm not going to do that sound effect.

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,640
 I thought about it for a second and said, "Nah, I'm good."

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:48,120
 The car slams into this nine-year-old girl and she is grievously injured.

92
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,120
 The driver kept going.

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,480
 Maybe the theater heard a sound effect.

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 Maybe it would have stopped.

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
 We don't know.

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,160
 But the car hit this girl and the driver kept going.

97
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
 It was a hit and run.

98
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,080
 And to this day, that driver has never been arrested for this.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 Now, this might be made up.

100
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
 This might be totally fictional.

101
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,680
 I don't want the Arizona police to be listening to this episode.

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
 They're like, "Boys, let's break up on the cold case file."

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,280
 And they're just arresting people.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,880
 Now obviously, this is going to draw a lot of attention.

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,320
 I've been to quite a few car accidents.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,640
 I've seen quite a few people die in car accidents.

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,360
 And it is a circus.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
 People are standing around.

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
 A lot of people are trying to figure out what to do.

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,480
 Once I was trying to help a woman who had been hit by two cars and someone broke into

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,560
 my car and stole my backpack.

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,480
 It was on Watt Avenue out in Sacramento, North Highlands area.

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,640
 So if you know the area, you're nodding your head.

114
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
 You're nodding your head.

115
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
 Yeah, that makes sense.

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,480
 Someone would break into your car while you're attending to a dying woman in Middle Street.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,000
 Anyways, you get a bunch of people show up at this stuff.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
 It's horrific and people are trying to figure it out and some people are just looking loose.

119
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 It's shocking.

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,840
 It's so shocking to see a human die during, like, mid-time traffic.

121
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,840
 It doesn't happen that often that it happens in public.

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,880
 It used to all the time, right?

123
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,760
 Back when, like, you were in medieval times, people were, you're seeing people get killed

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
 all the time.

125
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,280
 You're, like, carrying hay on your head back to the village and a bunch of, like, knights

126
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,800
 ride up and they're just, like, smashing peasants in the head.

127
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
 And you're just, like, "Open and smash me, Med!"

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
 If he does, I'm wearing this giant thing.

129
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,480
 I'm holding this basket of hay on my head.

130
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 I'll be okay.

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
 And you saw it all the time.

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
 People died right in front of you.

133
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,880
 We didn't have places to put the dead in the dying.

134
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,840
 It was called Grandpa's Room.

135
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,440
 It was called Grandpa's Room at the house.

136
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,640
 But we've become so used to just kind of shuffling the dead aside that it shocks us when we see

137
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,160
 people die in real life.

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,240
 And so the reason why I say that is you have a ton of witnesses to what's going on at this

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
 scene.

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
 The medics show up and they're trying to save this young girl's life.

141
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:03,760
 But a couple blocks away, a wife is preparing dinner while her husband sleeps upstairs.

142
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,720
 He's snoring away and she's like, "Hmmm, cuttin' sandwiches or makin' spaghetti or whatever.

143
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,520
 Makin' spaghetti sandwiches!"

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,720
 And she's standing there in her kitchen and all of a sudden she gets a vision of a girl

145
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,400
 she's never seen before.

146
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,760
 She has a vision of a girl she's never seen before and this girl standing in front of

147
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,160
 her and the girl says, "I love you guys so much.

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,960
 I just wanted you guys to know how much I loved you."

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,120
 And then she disappears.

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:43,040
 At the same time when her husband was sleeping upstairs, she appears to the wife and goes,

151
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
 "Hey, I love you guys."

152
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
 To him, he was sleeping upstairs and a box fell and hit him on the head.

153
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
 He's like, "Ahhh, I don't know if he was actually a nouger.

154
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,720
 I don't know if he made those noises."

155
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,440
 But they've linked those two events, like the girl woke him up.

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,800
 Didn't give him a vision, but through a box at him appeared in front of the wife.

157
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
 On 19th and Camelback in Phoenix, Arizona, there were these two girls walking down the

158
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,520
 street and in front of them, they see a woman walking with a little girl.

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,360
 And the two girls thought it was weird because they didn't know who these people were.

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,000
 They were walking on the street, this girl in front of them with her mom kept turning

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,400
 around and smiling and waving at them.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,200
 Her and her mom would have continued to walk down the street and then the girl would turn

163
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,680
 back around and smile and wave.

164
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,040
 The girls didn't really even put two and two together.

165
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,600
 They thought, "You know, that's fine.

166
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,200
 You know, the little girl's being nice, but it's a little weird, right?

167
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,680
 She keeps looking back at us."

168
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,720
 Maybe once or twice would have been fine.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,120
 Later on, apparently, when they were watching the news or hearing about this tragic hit

170
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,200
 and run with a nine-year-old girl, they realized that was the girl in front of them.

171
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 The girl who was walking with the woman was Samantha.

172
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,760
 At the scene of the accident itself, right, we're back in this tableau and there's medics.

173
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
 They're trying to keep this girl alive.

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,000
 It is a futile mission.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,200
 This girl does die, but they're trying their best, right?

176
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,120
 Traffic has stopped on this road.

177
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,000
 People are standing around watching the valiant efforts of the medical technicians and they

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,080
 see them get the gurney out and put this little frail body on the gurney and they wheel it

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
 and they put it in the back of the ambulance.

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,240
 They activate the ambulance sirens and as the ambulance begins to drive away, people

181
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 who are standing there see Samantha.

182
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,160
 Now if you've ever been in an ambulance, I've been in quite a few, the windows are higher

183
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 than the gurney.

184
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,440
 Otherwise, you'd be sitting in traffic.

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,960
 You're rocking out to the Jonas Brothers and then you have these giant transparent

186
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,560
 windows in an ambulance and you see blood squirting everywhere.

187
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,400
 They're like, "More gauze, more gauze."

188
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
 They're trying to heal them.

189
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,920
 No, you can't see everything in an ambulance.

190
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
 They have those little windows.

191
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,800
 I wonder actually why they have those windows in there.

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,920
 Is it so that people in the back don't get bored?

193
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,040
 So the technicians in the back don't get bored.

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
 They're just sitting in a giant metal box all day.

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 At least they can look out the windows and go, "Oh, look at that guy.

196
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
 He's a big fan of the Jonas Brothers as they see you dancing."

197
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
 But the windows are higher than the gurney.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,240
 So the fact that they see the girl, is she standing up?

199
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,360
 The only way you could do this is that the girl was standing up and peeking out of the

200
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,600
 windows and as this ambulance is pulling away, several witnesses at the scene saw the little

201
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,760
 girl, her face and her hands pressed against the ambulance windows, staring out at them.

202
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:55,600
 See, the ambulance drove away.

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,720
 I don't think anyone was like, "Oh, she's okay."

204
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,520
 I mean, obviously anyone who saw her get hit by this car or the aftermath knows she's

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,480
 not standing up anytime soon.

206
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,480
 So the general consensus at the scene would have been like, "Dude, we just...

207
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,040
 That was her ghost."

208
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,960
 There's no other way to explain that.

209
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,160
 Amulets is driving away and she's standing up with her face and her hands pressed against

210
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
 the window.

211
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,040
 The story goes that these sightings were reported over the next few months to her mother.

212
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,760
 They actually went to Samantha's mother.

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,560
 I saw your daughter.

214
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,960
 I saw your daughter's ghost.

215
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,160
 I guess I should have said that first.

216
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 You saw my daughter?

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 She's alive?

218
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
 Aw, you added the ghost part.

219
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,840
 When you could argue, this is an interesting story because on the one hand, when you have

220
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,400
 this much information but you're not able to track anything down, it is really, really

221
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,840
 suspect.

222
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,000
 But on the other hand, I will say this just from years of researching this stuff and especially

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
 the last four years where I've really been trying to document my sources for you guys.

224
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,680
 Any story that takes place, I would argue before 2005, maybe even make it a little bit

225
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,280
 higher, 2008, it's really, really hard to find sources.

226
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
 It's not impossible.

227
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
 It's not impossible.

228
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,440
 We've done it in the past but these little stories that sure would have been in the newspaper,

229
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,880
 they would have been on like the Arizona Register or the Phoenix Times or whatever newspaper.

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
 You have to, back in 1996, they weren't even digitally archiving this stuff.

231
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
 You can get digital archives of this newspaper but then you have to scroll through a bunch

232
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,800
 of papers trying to find any reference to this.

233
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,360
 And to be fair, I tried and others have tried because it's such an evocative story, isn't

234
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 it?

235
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,760
 I don't know proof of this but it's harder to find proof unless it's been published in

236
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,600
 a book, even newspapers get spotty because it may not be completely digitized.

237
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,100
 But assuming that the story is true, the mother's name and the girl who got hit by the car, their

238
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,440
 names would be in the newspaper.

239
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,320
 So the fact that people would be contacting the mother later on over the next couple of

240
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,640
 months, that tracks.

241
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,480
 That tends to happen when people, when tragedies happen, every time the story gets brought up

242
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,880
 or especially initially when it's out, people will reach out to the family.

243
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,320
 So I, if the story is true, the fact that they're able to track down the mom, it makes

244
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 sense.

245
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 It makes sense.

246
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,000
 I could see that happening over the next couple of months.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,040
 People sharing this story with her.

248
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 The mother didn't really feel left out from this whole experience though because she also

249
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,440
 reported that she would often have dreams that her daughter was there communicating with

250
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
 her.

251
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,500
 And it was, the dreams were so vivid.

252
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,240
 It felt like they were real but then she woke up and it was just a dream.

253
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,600
 So she seemed to be, I imagine that's pretty common with people going through grief of losing

254
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
 a child.

255
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,120
 But it's definitely an interesting story.

256
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,160
 Really what, and I haven't come across anything like this, at least that I can remember.

257
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,840
 First off, there's the by-location.

258
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,920
 I believe we've covered this on the show before.

259
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,880
 It's a paranormal phenomenon.

260
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,960
 It's not super common but it's not super rare either.

261
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,980
 Sometimes it gets attributed to stuff like shape-shifting demons.

262
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,300
 Sometimes it gets attributed to things like skinwalkers or alternate realities but by-location

263
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,260
 literally means in two places at once.

264
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,500
 We actually covered that story recently about that that I thought could be alternate reality

265
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,420
 about the two girls in the bathroom in the basement.

266
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

267
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
 I really like that one.

268
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,180
 But basically it is you're at home and your roommate comes in and they walk into your

269
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,100
 room and you're just like sitting there and you're just sitting there like, "Hey Joe, what's

270
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
 up?"

271
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
 And he walks by and goes in the room.

272
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,900
 And then you get a call from Joe and he's down at Walmart and he wants to know if you

273
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,080
 want to get any honey roasted almonds.

274
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,440
 We see a lot of that online but it's not the most rare.

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
 It's not the most common.

276
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,800
 It's also not super exciting really.

277
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
 Like you're like, "Oh no Jason, did he get the almonds?

278
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 I need to know."

279
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,420
 It just, sometimes we find weird ones like the thing that happened in the basement but

280
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,960
 for the most part it's just people being seen in two places at the same time.

281
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,060
 I can't recall a time that a ghost has done that.

282
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,140
 And I can't recall a time when a ghost did that while the body was still alive.

283
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,980
 That's another interesting quirk of this.

284
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,620
 The girl was dying.

285
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,220
 She wasn't dead and yet her spirit is being seen all over town.

286
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,660
 Remember if this story is true, those are the cases we hear about.

287
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,180
 Those are the cases where people felt the need to report it to someone else or to track

288
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,420
 down this mom.

289
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,120
 There could have been some 52 year old bachelor sitting in his apartment and he's flipping

290
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,960
 through the channels and then all of a sudden there's a 9 year old girl going, "Hi!"

291
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,080
 And he's like, "I'm not going to tell anyone that.

292
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
 People are going to think I'm insane.

293
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,600
 I'm just going to ignore that even happened."

294
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,560
 Or there could have been people who were doing things and she appeared to them and they didn't

295
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
 notice her.

296
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,160
 And she just moves on.

297
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,560
 She's like, "Oh man, that's the second worst thing that happened to me today."

298
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
 It's super weird because we have the by location.

299
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,460
 We have the ghost while she's still alive thing.

300
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:07,500
 And then her contacting people who have no connection to this girl is quite odd.

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,460
 I don't even know how to classify that.

302
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,460
 I'll try though because this was my theory with this one.

303
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,100
 I thought what if this girl was going to play...

304
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
 None of them had met this girl before this time but what if this girl was going to play

305
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,760
 a part in their lives?

306
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,560
 The webbing of fate had been laid out and she was going to meet the couple.

307
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,080
 She was going to drop a box on that dude's head no matter what.

308
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
 She was going to meet these couples.

309
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,460
 She was going to hang out with these girls at some point.

310
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,440
 She was going to interact with all of them in the future.

311
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
 But this hit and run accident cut her life short.

312
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,760
 But her psychic influence, like her ability to see who she was going to love and who she

313
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,940
 was going to be friends with and all of a sudden even though those things hadn't happened

314
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,220
 yet she was able to interact with them.

315
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,940
 That's really the only thing I can think of.

316
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,220
 She may have been someone who was going to be very influential when she was older but

317
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,980
 she died.

318
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,260
 And yet the strings of fate kept pulling her to meet those people.

319
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,700
 And again there may be a lot of other people that she would interact with in the future

320
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,140
 she hadn't met yet.

321
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,480
 And that she appeared to as a ghost saying goodbye and they didn't report it to us.

322
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,920
 Very very weird ghost story.

323
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
 Very bizarre.

324
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
 It could be totally made up.

325
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,760
 We have a lot of specifics and then we don't have the right specifics.

326
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 Names.

327
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,680
 We don't have any sort of news article on this for such a brutal crime.

328
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,840
 But fascinating story nonetheless.

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,120
 Was this girl destined to be a very influential person in a lot of people's lives?

330
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,860
 We don't know but a tragic and fascinating ghost story nonetheless.

331
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,540
 Erin and Kate let's go ahead and get you in that flight uniforms and Tosh the Keys

332
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,780
 to the Carbenter copter where we're leaving behind Phoenix, Arizona.

333
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,980
 We are headed all the way out to a small town somewhere in America.

334
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:17,020
 It's funny because long-time listeners of the show know that I don't do two of the

335
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,500
 same story per episode.

336
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,160
 I always do like an alien story or ghost story or true crime story and an alien story or

337
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,560
 a demon story and some dude eating his poop.

338
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,480
 Like I always try to mix it up but both of these stories because they involve some of

339
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,280
 the most powerful ghosts I've ever come across I wanted to include them.

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,700
 A little compare and contrast because in that last segment we had a girl simply saying goodbye.

341
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,120
 But the fact that she was everywhere all at once.

342
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
 Super bizarre.

343
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,060
 And the fact that she was interacting with people who had never met her.

344
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,060
 Very very weird.

345
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,920
 That's a power level you don't normally see in a ghost?

346
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,540
 This one I would say the same thing.

347
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,900
 This is a power level you don't normally see in a ghost.

348
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,660
 The question is is this good?

349
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,980
 Is this a good power level for a ghost to be at?

350
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,180
 Should ghosts be this strong?

351
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,780
 I basically is what I'm saying.

352
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,220
 In this story we actually have it from the horse's mouth herself.

353
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,680
 A young woman is telling this story.

354
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,480
 This happened to her and she's talking about this online.

355
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,800
 And what I love is that you can actually look through her posting history and see this is

356
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,540
 the first time she's ever posted anything paranormal.

357
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,040
 That's usually a pretty strong...

358
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,200
 What's the opposite of a red flag?

359
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 A green flag?

360
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 Is that a thing?

361
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
 Or is this no flags?

362
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
 Cause like a red flag is a sport thing.

363
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,720
 It's a really good no flag.

364
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,920
 Because if you look through her posting history she's like buying antiques and talking about

365
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,740
 a bunch of normal stuff and then she's like oh by the way this happened.

366
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,060
 If she's constantly talking about omega level paranormal events like this one then I'd go

367
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,940
 oh she's just a fiction writer.

368
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,180
 Someone did that recently.

369
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,100
 There's someone posted in the cheerleader subreddit that...

370
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,860
 Yeah I am subscribed to that one.

371
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,500
 That her friend became a cheerleader.

372
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,700
 Her friend used to be a nerdy girl who played video games and watched Marvel movies or whatever.

373
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,160
 And then she joined the cheerleading squad and now she's a drunk slut.

374
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,040
 What should I do?

375
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
 And that's not what the cheerleading subreddits for.

376
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,600
 It's for just photos of hot college cheerleaders and hot professional cheerleaders.

377
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,680
 So people are like that's not what this is for.

378
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 It goes somewhere else.

379
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,160
 But I decided to click on this person's profile.

380
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
 They...

381
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,880
 Before going to the cheerleader subreddit they're very active in a subreddit.

382
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,320
 I hate reddit for reasons like this.

383
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,880
 I hate reddit for reasons like this.

384
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,780
 They have the most despicable, disgusting subreddits where just gross people hang out.

385
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,180
 This is a subreddit called bimbofication.

386
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,580
 This isn't even the worst I've seen.

387
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,020
 This isn't even the worst I've seen.

388
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,500
 Bimbofication is a subreddit where it talks about women getting hit on the head with mallets

389
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,860
 or drinking like magical juice or joining the cheerleader squad and becoming drunk sluts.

390
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,500
 Like it's a whole subreddit dedicated to that.

391
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,880
 And that's where this person that spent most of their time posting was on the bimbofication

392
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 subreddit.

393
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 I...

394
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,580
 You could dismiss that cheerleader thing, right?

395
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
 Because that's...

396
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
 That didn't happen.

397
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,280
 They're just reliving their fetish on the cheerleader board.

398
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,000
 Keep your filth off of my hot college cheerleader photos.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,480
 This one though, because we have this person named Nipley and everything they post about

400
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,960
 is antiquing and then they have this story, it makes it way more believable.

401
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,580
 Now we don't have Nipley's real name, we're gonna give her the name Judith, if that's

402
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,100
 a real name just guess.

403
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,020
 But anyways, Judith tells this story.

404
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,540
 She said not long after her father had passed away, she was driving to work.

405
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,180
 And all of a sudden, Judith wasn't Judith.

406
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,320
 Well, part of her was.

407
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,340
 But it was like Judith took a back seat to another force.

408
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,880
 Judith, as she was driving down the road, says that she felt her father's presence enter

409
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 her body.

410
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:21,180
 Specifically, she said, "I felt like he was looking through my eyes."

411
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,200
 He was inhabiting part of her psyche.

412
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,320
 And not only was her deceased father looking at the world through her eyes, he then...

413
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,180
 looked around.

414
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,760
 So it's like he's gained motor control of her as well.

415
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,420
 She says, "I remember driving, I remember my father being inside of me, taking over

416
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:50,220
 and looking out through my eyes and I looked around the car, stared out at the road ahead

417
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,380
 of me and looked into the rear view mirror."

418
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,700
 She said, "When I looked into the rear view mirror it was me, like I saw me, but I could

419
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,320
 also feel my father's presence staring out of my eyeballs."

420
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,040
 She says this only lasted a few moments.

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,360
 And then this sensation was gone.

422
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,960
 But she didn't mention it to anyone.

423
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,200
 This is one of those things, like if you came home and there was a nine-year-old girl sitting

424
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,800
 in your living room and she was waving at you, and then she disappeared.

425
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,640
 After you picked up all the groceries that you dropped and washed your pants, you may

426
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,700
 or may not tell anybody, right?

427
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,060
 Because it sounds insane.

428
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,500
 It sounds absolutely insane.

429
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,740
 And this is something she's like, "I didn't tell anyone that this had happened.

430
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
 What are you going to do?"

431
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,500
 Part of the grief process, right?

432
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 Who knows?

433
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,460
 People don't really know until they're going through it before.

434
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,580
 I've never heard that before, though.

435
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,420
 I've never heard someone say, "Yeah, I really miss my dad, but it's okay because every so

436
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,500
 often he's in my eyeballs."

437
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,100
 But everyone grieves differently, right?

438
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,300
 Maybe it's just part of the grief process.

439
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,240
 However that weekend, Judith was at some sort of family gathering and one of her brothers

440
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,200
 pulled her aside and said, "This is going to sound crazy.

441
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,480
 And I know it sounds crazy, but I got to tell somebody about this."

442
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,040
 He said the other day he was sitting on the couch watching TV.

443
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,040
 And his two kids were just playing in front of him.

444
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,740
 And all of a sudden he felt a presence inside of him.

445
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,580
 He told Judith, he goes, "I don't really know how to say this, but I'm sitting there

446
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
 and watching television.

447
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,140
 My kids are playing."

448
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,700
 And then all of a sudden, dad was inside of me.

449
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,780
 I could feel dad staring out of my eyes.

450
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,860
 He was seeing what I was seeing.

451
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,200
 Or I was seeing what he was seeing.

452
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,440
 And he watched my children.

453
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,040
 I sat there and stared at my kids while dad was staring at my kids.

454
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,600
 He was inside of me, Judith.

455
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,640
 I feel like I'm going nuts.

456
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,120
 It doesn't make any sense, does it?

457
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,560
 But a few moments later, the feeling passed.

458
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:20,700
 A long time ago, I did an episode called "The Judas Complex."

459
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,740
 Can a ghost possess a person?

460
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,940
 Or can a ghost possess a human?

461
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
 Something like that.

462
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,340
 I'll put it in the show notes.

463
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,460
 And that was basically asking the question.

464
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,220
 We know demons can possess people.

465
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,700
 Can ghosts possess people?

466
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,500
 That was such a specific example because Judith is scary.

467
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 He's the guy who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, sold him out to the Roman authorities,

468
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,600
 which led to Jesus being crucified.

469
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
 Yeah, him, right.

470
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,200
 Because he's such a high level in the religious community.

471
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,480
 Everyone knows who this guy is.

472
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,840
 Demons are giving him high fives and they're all burning his hand.

473
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,760
 He's like, "Oh, I made the wrong choice."

474
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
 That would make sense.

475
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:04,680
 That would make sense to be able to be possessed by a diabolical character in religious history.

476
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,360
 But a run-of-the-mill human ghost.

477
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,200
 I don't think I've ever come across a story like this.

478
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,180
 Generally, when people get possessed, it's demonic.

479
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,860
 There are stories where people go to a house and there's a malignant spirit there.

480
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,180
 And that spirit can influence your thoughts.

481
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,900
 We've covered stuff like that.

482
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,380
 That's not super rare in Paranormal Phenomenon.

483
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,540
 But the idea, again, that is more of the location.

484
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,240
 But as far as a possession, like this.

485
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,680
 Outside of any other sort of vortex or mystical energy going on outside of some sort of person

486
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,860
 of huge religious importance.

487
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,560
 That would make sense that that stuff could possess you or influence you.

488
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,120
 But the fact that they're driving down the road and they're sitting with their kids and

489
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,980
 their father is going inside of them, I cannot think of another time that this has happened.

490
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,700
 Driving on the road possessed by a ghost.

491
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,000
 Not a demon.

492
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
 There's no protection against it.

493
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:14,520
 If this story is true, this is one of the weirdest and most dangerous ghosts we've ever covered.

494
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 We've covered ghosts that have murdered people.

495
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:29,480
 But the idea of a ghost possessing their living children, that's so dangerous.

496
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
 That's so dangerous.

497
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 One of the things that we look at when we talk about ghosts, ghostly phenomenon, like

498
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,120
 why do ghosts exist?

499
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,360
 We obviously have the skeptical answers, they don't.

500
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,640
 Then we have answers like, I often say sometimes ghosts are just a recording, like a background

501
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,160
 noise, a high emotional event is left at psychic thumbprint on a location.

502
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,720
 It's not a ghost you can interact with, it's just a recording.

503
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,400
 And then sometimes we have people who can't move on, who can't let go.

504
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,360
 And those ones, you have to accept that you're dead.

505
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:09,280
 And if you don't accept that you're dead, that is going to cause some serious ramifications,

506
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,280
 not just for your immortal soul, but for anyone else in that environment.

507
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,400
 You have to move on.

508
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,440
 And generally the idea would be you stick around as a ghost because you can't move on,

509
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,280
 you want to see how things play out, you're really waiting for the new Batman movies,

510
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,440
 so you're just kind of floating around.

511
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,680
 Or you have to move on eventually, it would make sense because you would be separated

512
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,160
 from your mortal body, you're in this new reality basically, but you're still floating

513
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,680
 around Earth.

514
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,000
 And you go, you know, there's nothing for me here, I can't communicate with anyone,

515
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,480
 all the other ghosts here are super crazy, they're super maniacal, but there was Victorian

516
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 chicks, woohoo!

517
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,440
 I'm going to go to England a little bit more, hang out with those sexy ghosts.

518
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
 But I got to move on.

519
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,560
 And if a ghost had the ability, if someone died and then they had the ability to go into

520
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,640
 their children's bodies, why leave?

521
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,520
 Why would you?

522
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
 Why would you move on?

523
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,080
 You can communicate, you can watch your grandchildren grow up.

524
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,760
 You wouldn't need, there'd be no reason for you to go.

525
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,560
 And there's no way to make you.

526
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,880
 There's no way to make a ghost move on, a lot of times you're trying to convince the

527
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,640
 ghost to go to the tunnel, that they're dead and to have peace with that, that after life

528
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,680
 isn't scary, there's a beautiful place waiting for you.

529
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,800
 You couldn't say that to someone who's sitting there eating court after court of Haagen-Dazs

530
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,720
 in their daughter's body.

531
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,400
 You're like, there's something beautiful, there's something beautiful right here, there's

532
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
 more Haagen-Dazs, I'm just going to eat all this stuff.

533
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,960
 And if I destroy this body, who cares, then it'll just be me and my daughter floating

534
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
 around as ghosts.

535
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,000
 And I'll teach you this trick, well just keep going into people's bodies.

536
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Taking them over.

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,360
 If the story's real, this is terrifying.

538
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,680
 Because it means that ghosts don't have to leave.

539
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,440
 It means ghosts can stick around and not in a little Casper way where they're flowing

540
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,440
 through walls, they can just take over a new body.

541
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,600
 At that point they're not a ghost, at that point they're some sort of new entity.

542
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,640
 Possession is really, really hard and there's a lot of rules over who you can possess and

543
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
 how to get rid of a demon.

544
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,960
 This is breaking those rules.

545
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,720
 This phenomenon is breaking these rules.

546
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,360
 Super dangerous.

547
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 Super super dangerous.

548
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,480
 And I feel like I'm just stating that over and over again, but I almost feel like I'm

549
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,540
 not stating it enough.

550
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,840
 If this phenomenon is correct, it can change the way that the world of ghosts interact with

551
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
 the world of humans.

552
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,760
 I've mentioned on a couple of recent episodes, paranormal stories are coming a lot harder

553
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,920
 to find.

554
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,420
