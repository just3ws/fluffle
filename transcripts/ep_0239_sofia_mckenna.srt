1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 A young man's journey into the jungle to find some guava

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,940
 Turns in to a close encounter of the ferned kind get it cuz ferns jungles

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,840
 That might have been a bit of a stretch

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
 But then the next story we're gonna look at if you didn't like that one. Don't worry. There's another one coming

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,280
 A young woman goes missing

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,040
 Unfortunately things like this happen

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,440
 Quite often but when her mysterious disappearance is linked to a haunted lighthouse

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,280
 All bets are off today on dead rapper radio

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:46,840
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of dead rapper radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Let's go ahead and move on with our first topic now

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,840
 Let's go ahead. You know, we don't really have a jungle terrain vehicle. We did till I got blown up the carboner copter

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,920
 But but we're just gonna have to hack and slash our way through the jungle here because what we're doing is we are going to

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
 South America

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
 specifically we are headed down to Brazil so

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,440
 You're hacking and slashing. I'm just walking behind you because you know, I'll let you do all the grunt work

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,220
 You're the one who wants to hear these stories hacking and slashing through the jungle all to help fight

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,000
 Cougars or mountain lions. No, no, what do they call the jaguars?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,520
 Yeah, I'll fight those while you're hacking and slashing through and as we're going through the jungles of Brazil

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,100
 We also go back in time to the year

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,160
 1978 I was two years old when this story took place. So imagine me as a two-year-old baby

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,680
 sitting watching

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
 What was on in 1978?

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
 Watching threes a company

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,480
 Actually wasn't allowed to watch that show not just as a baby

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,240
 That was one of the many shows that was banned in my house growing up

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,360
 We weren't allowed to watch threes company, which it wasn't that funny. Anyways, I didn't care

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,200
 And I don't remember what else probably because they were banned

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,240
 But I remember there's a lot of stuff we couldn't watch nor how to crude was what my dad said that shows too crude

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,800
 Oddly enough Meredith children. We got to watch that. I think my dad was more relaxed

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,000
 But I'm that show came out anyways. So it's 1978

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,700
 And as we're in the jungle we're basically cutting a parallel pep

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,000
 We're basically stalking this kid really because we don't want to interact with them

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,280
 We don't want to interfere with what's about to happen. There's a young man. His name is Luis Carlos Sara 16 year old boy

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,640
 He's walking through the jungle and he's in the jungle specifically to go pick up some guava

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 Which actually sounds pretty dope

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,680
 Imagine and we kind of covered this the Amazon is actually man-made. It was made as like a giant supermarket by the natives

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,360
 hundreds or thousands of years ago

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,720
 There's something compelling about being able to just be like, you know, what do you want for lunch?

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,440
 I don't know a couple pears and just walk out and grab pears like I've never lived and I don't people on farm

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,200
 And basically I've just explained like farm life, but I've never been like that. I've always been like, oh man

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,640
 I want some guava, which I don't I've never even eaten guava, but let's say like oh, I want an apple

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,480
 I have to walk to a store to get an apple or walk to a farmer's market to get an apple

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,360
 I've never just been able to walk out to a tree pick an apple off a tree and eat it

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,880
 I've never ever ever experienced that at all

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,000
 Super bizarre now that I say that out loud, but I've never experienced that never walked up to a chicken shook it to an egg

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,040
 Pop out and ate the egg have never done any of that stuff

47
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 So but anyways, he's able to Luis was able to go in he's looking for guava now. It's noon. The hot sun is overhead

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,720
 beating down on his body

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,920
 I don't know why he's paused like that. It was weird

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,000
 Anyways, it's beating down on him and he's just going about his day and then all of a sudden he hears a

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,920
 And it was louder than that. I was just trying to make a sound effect a dramatic sound effect

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,040
 It was a loud bang, but I didn't want to blow your eardrums out loud bang

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,560
 So imagine that clap with the bang on top of it times 20 because what it's loud enough that

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,500
 Gets his attention. He's in the jungle if he's not paying attention to all the predators lurking around him

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,220
 He's dead. He's constantly having to turn around so he never has his back to a giant jungle cat

56
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,820
 This noise is loud enough to make him go up. I don't care about what's in the jungle

57
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:28,500
 What's overhead because this loud sound came from overhead? He looks up and he says he says he sees something that is

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,040
 Brighter than the Sun. It's a light brighter than the Sun now. It's interesting because

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,900
 What he is seeing he doesn't know what it is, but we do we traveled back in time so we know the future

60
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,780
 What he's seen as a UFO and then there is there's a couple interesting things about this right off of that one

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,580
 broad daylight like broad broad daylight and to

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,120
 At noon when the Sun's directly overhead to see something brighter than the Sun

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,980
 Right above you almost seems impossible

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,720
 Because you're already bathed in light and for something to be lighter than the light you're in

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,080
 I guess if you're like outside in the day and someone strapped like flashes a strobe light in front of you

66
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,520
 That's technically brighter than the Sun

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,060
 But it just seems such a it seems so bizarre to have that be like I was looked up at the Sun

68
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,800
 But then I saw something actually brighter than the Sun right above me

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,140
 And then that wasn't bad enough if he wasn't his mind wasn't reeling by like how was this possible?

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,340
 He starts to be pushed down. He said that he described it as if two strong hands

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,980
 were holding his shoulders and

72
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,160
 Slowly like pushing him to the ground

73
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,820
 Pushing him down and he couldn't resist it and it finally gets him all the way to the ground

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,040
 And now he's laying flat completely paralyzed and looking up at this super bright light

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,580
 Now at this point you're thinking what could be work like what's gonna happen now?

76
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,740
 Like what's gonna happen to this poor kid? He's been blinded. He's been paralyzed

77
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,340
 Jungle cats are putting on their bibs getting ready to eat him, but then he slowly starts to lift off off the ground

78
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:16,160
 Starts to levitate over the jungle floor and begins flying up into the craft now

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
 That sounds kind of cool because you think like you'd be Superman and stuff

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,080
 But it's not cool if you can't control it like Superman is only cool because he controls where he flies

81
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,600
 If he had all his normal powers, but flex Luther decided where he went

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,840
 He wouldn't be that cool and that was this dude this guy was Superman with no self-control

83
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,240
 He ends up flying into the UFO like a big window opened up

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:49,280
 He flies into the window he's actually terrified at this point. There's no dramatic music playing

85
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,480
 Oh, I think Superman came out this year actually didn't come out like 77 78

86
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,160
 Anyway, super not superman the boy

87
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,400
 flies into the UFO

88
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,320
 Defeats Brainiac the boy flies into the UFO and he's sitting there. He's not sitting there. He's actually a prisoner

89
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,740
 He's still paralyzed. He says that he sees these three figures in metallic suits

90
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,680
 Walking around the inside of the UFO can't understand what they're saying and interestingly enough. They also have visors

91
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,320
 So he can't see their face

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,120
 He can't really see anything. They're basically wearing armor and he can't understand what they're saying

93
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,520
 So none of this telepathy none of this universal translators

94
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,080
 He is their prisoner and they don't want him to know what they're saying now

95
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
 I know right now you think of Jason you don't cover a lot of UFO stuff and there's a reason why I don't cover a lot of UFO stuff

96
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,840
 It's not because I don't believe it. It's because most of it is I looked up in the sky

97
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,160
 I saw light I couldn't identify it flew away or I looked up in the sky this little hover ship appeared and then flew away

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,280
 I like this stuff where people are meeting stuff and abductions are always cool

99
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,080
 But usually abductions are just like I got abducted they stuck something up my butthole and then I went home

100
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,280
 And I'm like, yeah, this story is

101
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,560
 Has an interesting connection to a story that I've covered in the past

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,360
 And I want to see if you guys can catch it and I'll explain it if you didn't but I'm not just gonna end the episode

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,840
 Anyways, so he gets he's talking to these eight. He's not talking to him again

104
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,360
 He's just trapped these metal armored aliens are walking around they take

105
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,720
 So and they're walking around the UFO is continues to fly and then he

106
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,520
 flies like again being levitated flies back off like the little doctor table in the UFO

107
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,880
 back out the window and as he's floating down what he sees is a giant

108
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,440
 stone like a giant flat stone on the ground

109
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,280
 surrounded by grass in all directions

110
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,120
 So he's no longer nowhere near where he left

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,200
 He has no idea where he's at and as he's being lowered onto this rock this big giant slab

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,080
 This flat slab he looks up. He sees the night sky, but the night sky is just black

113
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,920
 There is no stars whatsoever in the sky. So he's able to see this UFO hovering above them

114
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,960
 It's the traditional disc shaped type UFO flying out the window. He sees below him the grass and the rock slab

115
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,080
 He sees above him just pitch black no stars. No nothing and

116
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,160
 He lands on the rock slab

117
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,800
 He lands on the slab and the figures are standing back over him and they have this ball this tree

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,560
 they it's described as a transparent ball full of strange liquid and they force the whole ball into his mouth and

119
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
 He wakes up. He's on the jungle floor

120
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,280
 completely paralyzed

121
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,800
 Now he can't move and he can't really talk. He's just laying on the jungle floor

122
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,500
 He's crying out for help. He can't move and finally a fisherman just walking by

123
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,400
 Andy Griffith and his son are walking through the jungle and they see the 16 year old boy laying on the ground

124
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,160
 He's like help me. I'll use the only word I know in Spanish

125
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,880
 Agua Agua and I learned that from Sesame Street. So anyways to give him some water and he's like no no no water

126
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,360
 I need help and you know they pick him up. I don't know what I'm saying. They it's only one fisherman

127
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,120
 I love it when my fictional jokes end up becoming part of the story just one person one fisherman

128
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,160
 There was no sun there. There was no barney fife either one fisherman just one picks him up takes the boy to the hospital

129
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,440
 Three days this kid had been missing

130
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
 He went out to go get the guava and three days later they find him on the jungle floor

131
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,800
 The family thought he was gone. They had no idea where this kid went three days had gone missing in that period of time

132
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
 He was floating around hanging out on rocks in the middle of nowhere

133
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,520
 And for 10 days he was completely catatonic

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,280
 He just sat there in bed paralyzed. He couldn't talk

135
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
 Well, he could he could say Agua but I mean like he could he could kind of be like

136
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,880
 I don't know what the type stuff but he couldn't move and he couldn't really communicate. He sat there for 10 days

137
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,440
 And what the doctors noticed they noticed a couple odd things one his hair

138
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,480
 Was gone and first they thought it was shaved off. But as they were looking at it closer

139
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,360
 They realized it was burned off because he actually had burn marks along the tops of his ears

140
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
 And four of his teeth had been broken shattered

141
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,360
 And they think that it was fairly recent because they were still blood on his teeth like they were still fresh blood

142
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,720
 So it was like he was a recent wound. Maybe the fisherman dropped him a couple times as he was carrying him

143
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
 but

144
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,840
 Eventually after 10 days the kid louise snaps out of it and tells the story of what happened now

145
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,640
 Of course, some people believed in and some people didn't it kind of became this big brouhaha in the area and stuff like that

146
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,480
 And it's just become a story that's kind of disappeared into ufology except for one detail

147
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,560
 I did an episode a while back about a bigfoot being an interdimensional creature

148
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,080
 And in this episode and in this story there was a hiker who was walking through the woods

149
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,760
 He was walking through the woods. He walked through a portal which he didn't know was there and ended up in a

150
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
 dense jungle area

151
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,520
 Where there was a bigfoot type creature that was about to attack him from behind. He says I just saw the hand

152
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,680
 I heard a voice go gotcha

153
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,280
 And this hand reached towards him and then he stepped back out of the portal

154
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,160
 But in that portal world where he went it was bright daylight during

155
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
 When he was walking through the forest and then he walks through the portal and it's nighttime in this jungle

156
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,800
 He said one of the most alien things about the whole thing was he looked up at the sky. It was pitch black

157
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,680
 with no stars

158
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 Interesting detail and that's why I wanted to cover this story of louise

159
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
 One I thought is an interesting story because he's like it has kind of these hallmarks of

160
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
 Alien objections, but has that extra detail

161
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,240
 He was also teleported to some weird dimension where there was just a flat rock and grass

162
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,040
 Going as far as the eye can see

163
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,640
 There's I mean it could have taken him to kansas, but that kansas has stars kansas does have a moon like

164
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:10,560
 It's almost like that jungle world of the bigfoot creature and now this world that these aliens travel to are some sort of

165
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,000
 Void some sort of nexus place where you can kind of filter in and out of

166
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,280
 And then both having the same detail of

167
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,600
 A black sky with no stars to me that is chilling

168
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,960
 That too, I mean, I know there's like light pollution and stuff like that

169
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,920
 So sometimes you don't see all the stars, but you see some of them

170
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
 You know that they're there

171
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,680
 But to exist in a world that's just a pitch black sky with no stars to me is is

172
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,720
 Hellish it's so that is so alien to the human experience

173
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,600
 So yeah, I mean that's just a creepy detail shared between two stories on different continents two

174
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,920
 Unrelated stories involving unrelated creatures told by people who have never ever met each other

175
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,640
 And these two stories have never been connected before this podcast

176
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,080
 These are the these are the little pieces of what I believe are evidence

177
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,800
 That some of this stuff

178
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 Is factual

179
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,920
 Sure, two people can make up the exact same detail on accident

180
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
 or

181
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,920
 These people survive to tell their stories of this alien world

182
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,640
 That's accessible from earth

183
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,560
 It's not millions of light years away. You can get to it here through a portal through a craft

184
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
 But one thing's for sure

185
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
 It doesn't sound like a place that is hospitable to humans

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,680
 It sounds like a place we should do anything to avoid

187
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,720
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here now our next story is

188
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,600
 It's quite chilling. This is a weird one and this one's still ongoing

189
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
 The bulk of it has taken place, but there's still search efforts going on

190
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,680
 We're going to Connecticut the state that never sleeps. It's may 17th 2018

191
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
 So a little over a year ago this happened

192
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,200
 A little over a year ago this happened

193
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
 Headed out to Connecticut

194
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
 So in Connecticut

195
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:18,000
 There's a lot of people but we're gonna we're gonna look at two people in particular. So fia mackenna 21 year old model slash masseuse

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,480
 And her friend spencer mugford is 20 years old and he was a sailing instructor

197
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,360
 And he did like charter fishing boat stuff

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,120
 So he was a strong swimmer. He knew how his way around a boat

199
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,000
 They were good friends and they used to date and then they broke up and she got together with her ex

200
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,840
 This is all important, but not just being a gossip. I'm like, oh, did you know spencer and so fia broke up?

201
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,160
 I'm not trying to be a gossip. They're friends

202
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
 And she has a boyfriend and he's just chilling. So on may 27th

203
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
 They say, hey, you know, let's go on a boat ride. Let's go on a boat ride

204
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,640
 So they end up taking and I'm a little I don't know if technically if they stole this boat or if he had permission

205
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
 But they ended up taking a boat

206
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,680
 From the university of connecticut's boatyard. Can you imagine having such a rich school that your school has like a boatyard?

207
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,600
 I was lucky when I went to college. I was lucky if I could find a parking spot and now these oh

208
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,000
 Oh, puffy. Did you bring your boat today? Like who has a boat? Who has a boat section of their college?

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,920
 anyways

210
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
 That was my rant

211
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,840
 So it's just phenomenal. Are there colleges that I

212
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,520
 I could understand a boating college having a boat. I'm not saying like nautical school

213
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,680
 I'm like, why you guys have boats? But this is university of connecticut

214
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,640
 This is where people go to get like degrees in english and welding and stuff like that. They have a boat section

215
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,240
 It's just so bizarre to me. Is there like a public university that has like a helicopter section or they just have like 10

216
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,640
 helicopters hanging out

217
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,320
 anyways, so

218
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
 The soffia and spencer go and they take a boat from the university of connecticut's

219
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,120
 Bizarre boatyard

220
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,280
 So they take one of these boats and they're headed off to a place called the new london ledge lighthouse new london ledge lighthouse

221
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,400
 Now the new london ledge lighthouse is an interesting thing. It's basically a stone pier

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,680
 In the middle of the bay and there's a lighthouse built on top of it. It's not an island

223
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's not like connected to the land which is what would make an island, but it's not like a natural island

224
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,640
 It's just a stone a giant stone pier with a giant lighthouse. It's not just like a stick with a candle on it

225
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
 It's like a fully functional

226
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,280
 Lighthouse that people used to live in and then it went automated back like in 1987

227
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,080
 But a giant lighthouse like you imagine a us lighthouse sticking on a big concrete man-made island in the middle of this bay

228
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,040
 Now like all good crimes. This is why i'm a little i don't think he had permission to take the boat

229
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,480
 But i could be wrong in that detail, but she began snapchatting the journey

230
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,560
 So early that morning like around probably like 1 30 or something like that

231
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,040
 she post a snapchat of

232
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,960
 Spencer

233
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
 rowing the boat

234
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
 rowing the boat to the lighthouse

235
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,280
 And then at 2 a.m. There is a snapchat photo of her

236
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,080
 of sofia

237
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,400
 standing in front of a no trespassing sign at the lighthouse kind of sticking her tongue out

238
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Very playful photo

239
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,960
 2 a.m. That photo was taken posted a snapchat

240
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
 The next day sofia's boyfriend can't get a hold of her

241
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,880
 And he's calling around and she's not picking up her phone. He can't figure it out

242
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,840
 He ends up calling sofia's mom and saying hey, do you happen to know where sofia is and she's like i

243
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
 Don't you don't know and they kind of have that

244
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,200
 Normal conversation that starts off kind of like oh, yeah, yeah, but you can it starts to get panicked over time

245
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
 Sofia's mom goes okay. Well, you know, i'll see if i can get a hold of her at that point

246
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
 Earlier that morning

247
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,880
 Sofia's sister a little sister had gotten the mother's phone. It was playing with it

248
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:11,120
 So the mother didn't immediately see when she woke up that there were several missed calls seven missed calls from an unknown number on her cell phone

249
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,280
 But when she starts looking for sofia she she does get her cell phone

250
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,920
 And that is when she sees those seven missed calls from an unknown number. She calls the number back

251
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,040
 It goes to spencer's voicemail

252
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,800
 First phone call was made at 2 o 6 a.m. So six minutes after the photo was taken

253
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,600
 Then 2 o 7 a.m

254
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
 Three calls at 2 o 8 a.m

255
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,840
 In the final call from 2 o 9 a.m. So the mother didn't have spencer's phone number in her phone

256
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,040
 That's why it was coming up unknown but sofia would know the mother's phone

257
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,680
 So she was calling from spencer's phone and it would make sense because at 2 a.m

258
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,400
 Her phone that was posting the snapchat video was in the hands of spencer

259
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,200
 So spencer has her phone takes the photo six minutes later

260
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,240
 Spenser's phone is making phone calls to sofia's mother. So that chain of events makes sense

261
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,560
 But they start this search the police begin searching for sofia is the first person who's reported missing

262
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,760
 Eventually spencer is noticed that he's not there as well

263
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,440
 And they're looking for him as well everyone's thinking the worst

264
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,600
 As the as people are do you know where sofia is do you know where sofia is people go? Oh, you know, but look on our snapchat

265
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
 This show she was on a boat

266
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,040
 Late last night so they then see the photo of her standing in front of the no trespassing sign and people go

267
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,040
 She went to the lighthouse like her and spencer must have taken the boat because they can even see in the video of the boat

268
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,080
 They see the lights in the background so they can figure out where the boat was headed

269
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
 And then there's a photo of her standing in front of this lighthouse

270
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,840
 Sign no trespassing people recognize that because it's not a super popular tourist destination

271
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,200
 But people do go there for a reason and we'll get to that in a second. So

272
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,760
 The police go there and there's no one there. No one on this man-made island. This lighthouse. It's empty

273
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,920
 It's been automated since 1987. So they have to start thinking what could have happened to these two people

274
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,480
 His shirt spencer's shirt is tied around a mooring pole

275
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,160
 At the lighthouse so where they would tie the boats down to morum

276
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,840
 So where they would like throw it tied the boats down basically to keep them from flowing away

277
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,960
 They found his shirt tied around one end of that. So that was like one clue that they had

278
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,280
 48 hours after these two go missing so very shortly on they find the boat washed up

279
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
 On a shore it just basically

280
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
 crashed up somewhere

281
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,880
 There were no

282
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
 Footprints leading from the boat like across the

283
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,600
 Cross the sand there was no footprints like leading off somewhere. So they go the boat must have been abandoned

284
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,520
 So they start working with this theory. They go, okay, here's our theory

285
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,960
 They got to the they did get the lighthouse. We have photographic proof of that

286
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,920
 He tied the boat down with his shirt

287
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,480
 And they got up on the island and at that point the at some point the

288
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
 Shirt started to get untied and the boat

289
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,320
 got washed away

290
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
 And he jumped in the water after it, but he was probably really tired

291
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,040
 From you know, the well rowing out there

292
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,240
 He jumped in the water after it and she may have jumped in the water after him

293
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,720
 We're going to find the bodies because they're they are not on the island. They checked everywhere

294
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
 This is the reason why people knew to go there people

295
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,320
 Recognize the area because the lighthouse has a reputation for being haunted

296
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
 It is a place where people go to like meet ghosts ghost hunter shows have gone there

297
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,760
 Paranormal investigators have gone there and if you can take a boat from your college or you just have an own a boat

298
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,960
 You can go there too. It's not restricted property as far as well

299
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,800
 I guess there's a no trespassing sign

300
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,560
 But you know like teen is they're going to jump the fence and go into a graveyard anyway

301
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,040
 So I mean you can go there you can well physically go there, but they go there to go ghost hunting

302
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 It's a spooky place in the middle of nowhere

303
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,960
 So that's their working theory and they actually start to realize that that is most likely what happened

304
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 Because two weeks later they find spencer's body

305
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
 Floating in the water

306
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,120
 So they go okay, so this is what this is what happened like yes

307
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,760
 He tied the boat down

308
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,200
 And it started to break away and he jumped in to save the boat and she must have jumped in after him and they're done

309
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,920
 And and what's odd it was very odd

310
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,360
 It was they found his body on the day they were having his memorial service on the day of his memorial service

311
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 they find his body so

312
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 That does answer that question of what happened to him, but people are still trying to figure out what happened to sofia now

313
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,120
 Now I guess tying down a boat with your

314
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,560
 Jacket like I would think well, that's them. Why don't you just use a rope?

315
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,280
 But I mean i'm not a nautical person. I'm not a sailor. I guess is the term i'm supposed to use

316
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,840
 I guess a tie is a tie and this guy he wasn't some drunk frat boy like this is what he did for a living

317
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,920
 So he didn't just like loop it around the boat a couple times and then jump upon this pier like he tied it down

318
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,840
 The way you would moor a boat to a harb to appear

319
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,200
 He's doing nautical knots is what i'm saying. He wasn't just all doing it all loosey goosey like he had it dialed in

320
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,520
 But he unmoored it did get unmoored and it did float away. They know that

321
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,440
 He jumped in they're assuming that because his body was found in the river the question still is where is sofia

322
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,080
 People are going whoa, whoa, whoa if she jumped in the water after him

323
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,120
 How did she make the phone calls like did she make those seven phone calls and then jump in the water to find him?

324
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,680
 Please they're like we don't know

325
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,720
 And and the mother was like there's no she wasn't a confident swimmer

326
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
 There is no way she would jump into the water in the pitch dark

327
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,160
 Trying to find someone who's a better swimmer than her she he she go the mother says she just want to do that

328
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
 Two other men died

329
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,000
 In the harbor that day two other men died just from because it's like memorial day weekend

330
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,560
 So two other men died in boating accidents that they fell off their boats got drunk got hit by a boat whatever

331
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,960
 Both of those bodies have been found as well

332
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,400
 So we can we can presume that four people fell into the water that weekend

333
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,800
 Spencer, sofia, and then these two other men three of those people were found which is giving more credence to the

334
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,040
 Theory that she did not fall into the water because if she had fallen into the water she would have been found by now

335
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,360
 So people are thinking maybe she was stuck on that island and another boat came and kidnapped her

336
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,960
 Maybe she was stuck on that island and someone killed her serial killer or just a regular killer

337
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,680
 maybe they were being followed the whole time

338
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,360
 And someone untied the boat and there was a struggle and they throw Spencer in the water and they throw her on a boat and stuff like that

339
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
 Those are all very very chilling

340
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,160
 Things and I don't want to make light of this young woman's disappearance or the tragedy of spencer's death or anything like that

341
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,080
 I'm not trying to do that at all. However, there is an interesting

342
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,880
 paranormal note to all of this

343
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
 Like I said, it's a renowned place

344
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,320
 For ghost hunting, but not just that it's not just that

345
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,480
 This place was hated by the people who worked there. So from it was built in 1909

346
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,760
 And that was when the big pier was built and then they were building the lighthouse on top of it

347
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,680
 And then in 1987 the coast guard went fully automated. So now it's just a computer system that runs it

348
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,080
 Now the legend goes that at some point in the early times of this lighthouse in operation

349
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,320
 There was a guy some people say his name is john some people say his name is Ernie really depends on who you're talking to so

350
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,640
 Not super credible to begin with here, but some interesting

351
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
 Similarities so there was this guy his wife cheated on him

352
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,960
 So he jumped he climbed to the top of the lighthouse one night and jumped off and just

353
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,160
 All over the rocks

354
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,840
 And at that point people were like well, we got to get a new lighthouse keeper

355
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,640
 So they send someone else there, but what happens is lighthouse keepers who are working there

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,160
 Keep complaining about doors getting unlocked

357
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,960
 Of bed sheets kind of flying off their bed

358
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,800
 You'd make a cup make a cup of tea it fall down

359
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,040
 Normal poltergeist stuff stuff that is quite annoying

360
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 So, you know, you can deal with it. You can you know, you wake up you wake up and your bedroom door is open

361
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,440
 Which has happened to me quite a few times. It's because the wind is blowing through my apartment

362
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,240
 It's still creepy like when I wake up. I know why my bedroom door got pushed open. It's still very unsettling

363
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,480
 Imagine that on a rock in the middle of a stormy night and you're the only person in a spooky spooky lighthouse

364
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,040
 How much more terrifying that would be

365
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,320
 But this ghost also had another trick up its sleeve

366
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,800
 What would happen was people who would be working in the lighthouse

367
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,280
 Would go to leave and their boat would be floating in the harbor

368
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,680
 No matter how hard they tied these boats down

369
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
 Sometimes they'd get untied and float away

370
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,480
 Super creepy detail

371
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
 I remember when I was because I had looked at the Sophia stuff

372
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
 I was researching that and then I started researching the haunted past of this thing

373
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,320
 And just as like they're like the ghost does this the ghost does this the ghost unties boats the ghost does this and I was like, what?

374
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,640
 So this ghost is known for untying boats

375
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
 made by

376
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,960
 Like nautical knots again. They're not just doing a little like cheap shoelace knots. They know how to tie a boat down

377
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
 They go out their boat is floating away. They have to call for help

378
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,160
 That coupled with the fact that this ghost

379
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,960
 killed himself over

380
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,760
 his wife cheating on him

381
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,440
 And you have this spirit sitting there in the night

382
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,680
 And a young man and a young woman show up at a pier

383
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,880
 A young woman who and I'm not I'm not trying to cast any judgments on this person

384
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,480
 But you have a woman and a man on a pier that's haunted by a ghost who killed himself because his wife left him

385
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,760
 And this woman and this man on this pier used to be lovers

386
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,360
 But she left him for her ex-boyfriend. She got back together with her ex-boyfriend

387
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,120
 It's like this paranormal psychic pot

388
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,320
 Just bubbling forward as you have this perfect storm of elements at 2 a.m

389
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,120
 on this pitch black island

390
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,000
 Is is Sophia somehow still there?

391
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,240
 And again, this sounds totally insensitive, but is Sophia somehow still there?

392
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,280
 Will they not find her?

393
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,640
 Has she been

394
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,560
 We talked about other dimensions portals in just the last segment

395
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,360
 Is she caught somewhere between

396
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
 our reality

397
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 and Ernie's reality

398
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
 Is she trapped there?

399
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,920
 By a spirit so bent on vengeance

400
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,480
 That when the perfect victim

401
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,280
 Just dropped on his doorstep

402
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,320
 All he had to do

403
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
 Was untie a boat

404
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 And let it sail off

405
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,560
 Spencer jumps in

406
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
 She's frantically calling her mom

407
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,120
 on Spencer's phone

408
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
 In the dark

409
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,720
 Two in the morning

410
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 No one's picking up

411
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,000
 Why did she stop placing those phone calls?

412
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,560
 Did the battery die?

413
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,680
 And then she's trapped surrounded by pitch blackness

414
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,320
 And the sound of the sea around her

415
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,160
 Did something force her to stop making those calls?

416
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 Somebody or something

417
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,480
 No evidence of what happened to her has been found

418
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,360
 No clothing, no blood

419
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,680
 Nothing

420
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,960
 But there is one little piece of evidence to the story of Ernie

421
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,440
 Before the lighthouse went automated back in 87

422
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,480
 The last lighthouse keeper wrote in a log

423
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
 Rock of slow torture

424
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,560
 Ernie's domain

425
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
 Hell on earth

426
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,560
 May new London ledges light shine on forever because I'm through

427
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,720
 I will watch it from afar while I'm drinking a brew

428
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,800
 You got to wonder if that lighthouse keeper still lives out there

429
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,760
 But now safely snuggled on the coastline of Connecticut

430
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,440
 And if every so often he looks out and sees that lighthouse in the middle of the water

431
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,000
 remembers the horrific experience calling it the rock of slow torture Ernie's domain

432
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:46,240
 What did that lighthouse keeper see and experience to write those words into that log?

433
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
 It wasn't his journal, it was the log for the lighthouse

434
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,400
 What could he have possibly experienced over the course of his job there that would make him call it

435
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,120
 Rock of slow torture

436
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
 Who knows?

437
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 But the frightening thing is

438
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,880
 Someone else may be experiencing that same thing

439
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
 Right now

440
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,400
