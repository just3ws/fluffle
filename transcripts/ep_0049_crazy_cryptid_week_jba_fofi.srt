1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 did a giant spider star in a porn video,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
 and a serial killer that's such a loser,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,920
 even the news can't take him seriously

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,560
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,140
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,240
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,240
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
 It's hot.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,400
 The heat wave continues.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,680
 Just think about how interesting these podcasts

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,520
 are gonna be when the cold weather comes.

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,480
 I can't, well no, I really don't like cold weather.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,760
 I'm actually glad it's still hot.

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,640
 I'm good with that.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,520
 I'm good with that.

19
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,880
 You know, I've always wondered,

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,200
 well not always wondered.

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,720
 I was thinking about it the other day in the shower,

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,760
 but you know in movies how there's always that,

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,680
 not all movies, this is getting off to great start.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,080
 In movies there's that scene where the bad guy

25
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,960
 has this plan to like rob the bank

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
 or steal the money from the factory workers

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,360
 or be a corrupt politician.

28
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,920
 And like the kids or the good guys trick him

29
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,600
 into talking into a hot mic.

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,320
 Where it's like, oh yes kids,

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,760
 once I get rid of you four,

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,440
 once I throw you four into the wake thresher,

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,480
 I'm going to take over this town

34
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,000
 and I'm gonna sell it to the Russians.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
 And the Russians are gonna bury,

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,080
 it's my voice being broadcast.

37
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,440
 And then like everyone in the audience is like,

38
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
 (gasps)

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,600
 like everyone heard his secret plan.

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,920
 That is a trope that's gone on forever.

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,400
 That's a trope that's gone on forever

42
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,320
 from little rascals to doubt.

43
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,480
 There is that scene where the Pope was like,

44
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,200
 oh, if only they knew that my real plan

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,160
 was to let priests molest children.

46
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
 What?

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,880
 And then they show that everyone in Vatican Square

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,840
 was listening.

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
 Anyways, my question is,

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,200
 has that ever been done before in real life?

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,840
 I wonder if there's ever been like an evil businessman

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,760
 behind like he's in his, I don't know, dressing room.

53
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,600
 I don't know where businessmen get ready for stuff.

54
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
 But there's like a board meeting and the businessman's like,

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,800
 oh, I can't wait to fool these rubs

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,840
 to give me all of their stock.

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,920
 And then there's like some precocious eight year old

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,440
 in there with an iPad recording it.

59
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,720
 I don't know, that would be fascinating.

60
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,920
 I think we would know about it though.

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
 I actually looked up hot mic accidents

62
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,320
 and none of them included any of that.

63
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,760
 Not even close.

64
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,800
 I think the closest you'd have would be like Mitt Romney

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,240
 being recorded during the 2012 election saying,

66
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,000
 50% of Americans don't pay taxes or something like that,

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
 which was lame.

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,080
 So no, I hope that something like that has happened.

69
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,400
 It would be a great way to in someone's career,

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,280
 but it's turning out to not be a great way

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,120
 to start a podcast because that story went nowhere.

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,880
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

73
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,000
 So we got two great stories for you today.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,440
 I know you guys are waiting for if the spider

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
 was as ever started a porn movie, A Giant Spider.

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,040
 But come on, I can't give you the juicy stuff up front.

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,880
 That's one of our cryptid stories of the week.

78
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,600
 We're doing a cryptid, crazy cryptid story

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,320
 every day this week.

80
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,360
 So give me five to seven minutes of your time

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,240
 to talk about this utter loser of a serial killer.

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 Now, this guy is, this guy just has nothing good going for him.

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,440
 His name was John Eric Armstrong.

84
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,900
 And now I've said before the reason why

85
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,240
 they list serial killers and mass murderers

86
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,000
 and stuff like that, mass shooters as three names generally,

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,200
 is so people who have the name Jarmam Armstrong

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
 don't get brought into that group.

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,120
 They specify the middle name,

90
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,820
 so it differentiates them from every other person

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,280
 with just that person last name.

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,200
 This guy though, this guy has a totally different reason

93
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,480
 why his middle name is used.

94
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,880
 And I'm taking great pride in by calling him John Armstrong.

95
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,100
 So Jarmam Armstrong, this happened in Seattle,

96
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,440
 so fairly nearby to us.

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
 And this is back in the 90s.

98
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,520
 And what happened was the police in,

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,720
 or near Seattle, started finding dead prostitutes.

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 And they were all strangled or all had like crushed wind pipes

101
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,800
 and the police were like, okay, we have a serial killer.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
 And so they kind of start hanging around the area.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They're starting to do their investigations

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
 and stuff like that.

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 And they just threw good police work.

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,360
 They zero in on this guy, John Eric Armstrong.

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,800
 And they bring him and he just starts babbling like a baby.

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,160
 It was a babbling, he just starts crying like a baby.

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
 And he's like, oh, I killed those five women

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,600
 and I killed 11 more around the world.

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
 And he used to be in the Navy.

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,200
 And he said that when his naval ship,

113
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,680
 the Nimitz would dock at a port of call,

114
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
 he would get out and murder a prostitute as you do

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,080
 and then get back on the ship and go somewhere else.

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,680
 And so that's that.

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,000
 He was arrested, he was convicted in August of 2001.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,960
 The only interesting thing about this conspiracy case

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
 so far was that the fact that he was in the Navy

120
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,480
 and he was killing prostitutes around the world.

121
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,080
 However, as I was, and I was kind of reading the article

122
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,580
 and I was like, I don't know if this will make it

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,280
 onto the show, but then I came across these nuggets.

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
 These are great.

125
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
 Whoever wrote this article really didn't like this guy.

126
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,720
 Not saying that I'm a huge fan of him either

127
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
 'cause I'm not, but I'm reading this article.

128
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,000
 And okay, so it started, his motivation,

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
 this is what he said his motivation was,

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,560
 was that his dad used to abuse him, which isn't funny.

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,640
 That's horrible, okay?

132
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,040
 And then the reason why he started hating women

133
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
 was he had this high scroll girlfriend

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,040
 he was totally in love with,

135
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,600
 but then a hotter guy gave her some gifts

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
 and she dumped him.

137
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,920
 And so he viewed that as prostitution.

138
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,000
 So he just had this ingrained thing against prostitution.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
 And then you're like, Jason, it's a lot funny.

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,640
 This guy was emotionally abused,

141
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,160
 physically abused by his dad.

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,120
 He's killing prostitutes.

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
 Why are you laughing so much?

144
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,480
 Okay.

145
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,920
 So this is where it gets funny.

146
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,840
 It might just be me, but this is where it gets funny.

147
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,320
 Okay, so he hates his dad so much.

148
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,520
 His dad's name is John Armstrong.

149
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,360
 And so he hates his dad so much.

150
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,880
 He's like, I'm not going to use my father's name.

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,320
 I will no longer be known as John Armstrong.

152
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,680
 I will be known as Eric Armstrong.

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
 Okay, so fine, fair enough.

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
 I've known people to change their names.

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
 It's not a big deal.

156
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,640
 However, this guy was so adamant

157
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,840
 and people calling him Eric Armstrong,

158
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,920
 when he got arrested, he was wearing a shirt

159
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
 that just said Eric on it.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
 Like, I mean, almost like a Sesame Street character.

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,560
 Like, I can imagine if you knew him

162
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,600
 for years and years and years.

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
 And you saw him after your period of time,

164
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
 after he changed his name, you didn't know about it.

165
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,720
 And you're like, hey, John, he just looks at you.

166
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,920
 He glars at you and just taps his shirt.

167
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,720
 Who wears a shirt with their own name on it?

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
 And better yet, who wears a shirt

169
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,160
 with not their name on it?

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,600
 Okay, so then you're like,

171
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,840
 Jason, this guy's mentally disturbed

172
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
 while you're making fun of him.

173
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,400
 Well, trust me, I think it's funny.

174
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
 Maybe you don't.

175
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,080
 Okay, so now, okay.

176
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,840
 But then it gets even weirder than we're at right now.

177
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,840
 So, Eric, John Eric, the killer, tells police,

178
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,320
 and I can almost picture this.

179
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,320
 It sounds totally horrifying as he was with the prostitutes.

180
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,840
 Well, as John Eric was with the prostitutes,

181
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,800
 he'd go, he'd pick up a prostitute

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
 in the United States, across the globe, whatever.

183
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
 He'd go back to their place, go to the hotel room.

184
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 At some point, he would turn around

185
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,480
 and they would have his dad's face.

186
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,120
 He would look at them and it was his dad's just face,

187
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,680
 not body, but just a face on these prostitutes,

188
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
 and then he would kill them.

189
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
 So, it's so weird.

190
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
 So, not only was it a motivation

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
 that he hated prostitutes,

192
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,240
 but also prostitutes would morph into his dad.

193
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
 And my question wasn't like a morph,

194
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 like was it like a literal blink

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,520
 and then all of a sudden his dad's face was there,

196
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,880
 like, "Clean your room, kid!"

197
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
 Or was it just like a slow shifting?

198
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,120
 Either one is quite disturbing.

199
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
 So anyways, you would hang out with,

200
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,840
 he was married with kids.

201
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,520
 This guy wasn't just like a total,

202
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,960
 like he had a job and everything after he left the Navy.

203
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
 So, he could function in a normal society,

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,160
 but he would get a prostitute and he'd look at them.

205
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,920
 They would have his dad's face and then he'd kill them.

206
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,800
 My question is, his wife didn't have his dad's face.

207
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,240
 His kids didn't have his dad's face.

208
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,280
 His boss didn't have his dad's face.

209
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
 If you don't want to see your dad's face,

210
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,000
 don't go to prostitutes.

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,040
 If the only time you look and you see someone

212
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,320
 (imitates a growling)

213
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,440
 morph into your father, all of the matrix,

214
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,000
 don't see them, go a far away from them.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
 The article then, okay, so that's enough

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,680
 about how just wacky this guy is.

217
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,320
 The rest of the article says, basically,

218
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,840
 yeah, so he says that he killed five women near Seattle.

219
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,560
 And then for eight years as he was on the Nimitz,

220
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,520
 every time he landed in a port of call,

221
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,200
 he would murder someone.

222
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
 The article multiple times says that that's not true.

223
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,920
 He's totally making that up.

224
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,000
 He goes, some of the places they've done investigations

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
 and it's absolutely not true.

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
 There's no evidence to back it up.

227
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
 Other places are outside of FBI's jurisdiction,

228
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,720
 but they haven't gotten any notification.

229
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 So in this article, it says,

230
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,320
 academics say it is not unusual for serial killers

231
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,640
 to exaggerate their body count,

232
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,080
 to extend their feelings of superiority and domination.

233
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,320
 Then there's a quote, a lot of these guys are very eager

234
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,280
 to become the Heisman Trophy winner of serial killing.

235
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,480
 So not only does this article basically

236
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,920
 make this guy look out to be like a total loser,

237
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,280
 but then it's like, he's making it up.

238
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,920
 There's no way he killed so many people.

239
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
 The article is written to laugh at this guy.

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,040
 'Cause I laughed, I thought it was funny.

241
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,560
 Like at the beginning, I mean,

242
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,880
 that may say more about me than the article writer.

243
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,040
 The article's like, yeah, he killed these five women,

244
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,640
 but he's making up the rest.

245
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
 And he has these bizarre visions.

246
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,180
 He wears a shirt with somebody else's name on it.

247
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,400
 And it just, it keeps going,

248
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,840
 oh, the FBI investigated this, that's not true.

249
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,200
 They went to Hawaii where they said that he killed a woman

250
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,440
 and they're like, that's impossible.

251
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
 The ship wasn't there long enough.

252
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
 And they did find a dead stripper in a bed.

253
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,640
 And they're like, yeah, but that wasn't him.

254
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,680
 So the article basically, so this guy goes into prison.

255
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,520
 And he's like, yeah, dude, I'm gonna go in.

256
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,040
 I have this huge body count.

257
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,600
 Never have to see my dad's face again.

258
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
 And everyone basically just makes fun of him,

259
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,660
 pulls his pants down, not like to rape him,

260
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,000
 but like, I was thinking more of like, you know,

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,420
 to embarrass him, but I guess in prison it works both ways.

262
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,280
 My point being is that this guy

263
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,000
 who deserves absolutely no sympathy whatsoever,

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,360
 his last big moment in the spotlight,

265
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,980
 he's called a loser once again.

266
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,720
 And now he's again called a loser on my podcast.

267
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
 So good job, John Armstrong,

268
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,960
 here in prison for the rest of your life.

269
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,480
 I have nothing to worry about.

270
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
 Let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
 We're gonna move on to a story that has been requested,

272
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 story that's on the iceberg conspiracy list,

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,800
 and a story a lot of you guys have been waiting for.

274
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,720
 But most of you guys probably have never heard of it.

275
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,800
 And I'm not gonna be able to pronounce the name.

276
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
 I'm gonna try it once or twice.

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,240
 Then I'm gonna call it by its English translation.

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,960
 The cryptid we're covering today

279
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,600
 is the Jabba Fofi, Jabba Fofi,

280
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,440
 which means giant spider in Congolese or Baku.

281
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
 So we're back in Africa.

282
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
 Yesterday we did the Groot Slang.

283
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,560
 Today we're doing the Jabba Fofi.

284
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,760
 And Jabba Fofi, like I said, means giant spider.

285
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,200
 And what it is, is it is a giant spider.

286
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,760
 Depending on the description,

287
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,840
 it is either between three feet in diameter

288
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,520
 to six feet in diameter.

289
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
 And that's important.

290
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 We're gonna get into that in a bit.

291
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,000
 That differentiation.

292
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
 So we're gonna talk briefly about the spider

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,080
 and then we're gonna get on to the porn video.

294
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,560
 So this basically is a spider that is a legend

295
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,800
 in these areas, in these parts of Africa,

296
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,560
 where it lives in a hole and it covers itself with leaves.

297
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,320
 But before it is that, it's actually really important.

298
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,880
 It puts up webbing between two trees.

299
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,960
 And when something disturbs the webbing,

300
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,480
 it senses it, 'cause it's still tied to the web.

301
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
 And then it comes out and sucks the blood out

302
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,120
 and eats you and all that stuff, as a spider would do.

303
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
 And people in the area are like,

304
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,920
 no, this is 100% correct.

305
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,560
 This isn't like some dinosaur.

306
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,280
 This isn't the Groot Slaying.

307
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,600
 This is an actual, this is a non-mythical creature.

308
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,520
 This is a creature we have to deal with.

309
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,260
 If it builds a nest too close to the town,

310
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,360
 we have to destroy the nest.

311
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,080
 And they're describing what the babies look like

312
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,160
 and what the eggs are like the size of peanuts.

313
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
 And in Africa, they're saying these things

314
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,040
 are about three feet big.

315
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,480
 And what happened was there was an author named,

316
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,800
 I'm just, I know his last name off the top of my head,

317
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,240
 Gibson, and he went and he wrote a book

318
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,800
 about monsters in Africa.

319
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,920
 And he was investigating stuff like Mola Mempiki,

320
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
 which is like a bronosaurus.

321
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,360
 He's investigating all like he's Loch Ness level monsters.

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,760
 And he finds out about the spider.

323
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,920
 And he said, the way that they describe the spider

324
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,320
 was so matter of factual that he thinks,

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,600
 Gibson thinks it existed or exists.

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
 They say it's in danger now

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,040
 because its environment is being encroached on.

328
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
 But there's a difference when someone talks about

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
 something like the Loch Ness monster

330
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,760
 and something talks about a Jabu Fofi according to him.

331
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,740
 They're just very matter of factual about,

332
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,120
 this is the way it mates, this is the way it feeds,

333
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,760
 this is the way it has it tied out,

334
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,820
 this is where it lives,

335
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,720
 this is the environment that it feeds on and all that stuff.

336
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
 So he thought that led a lot of credence to the myth.

337
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,800
 He hadn't seen one, to be fair, he hadn't seen one.

338
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,240
 Could this creature exist?

339
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
 Now, oh, and let me say this,

340
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,520
 other people, other Westerners had said

341
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,440
 they had seen the spider and it was six feet big.

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,760
 And so those stories got out first

343
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,200
 'cause people would go there

344
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,080
 and they would see a six foot long spider

345
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
 and they'd go back to Rhodesia

346
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,820
 or they'd travel back to England

347
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,840
 and they'd be like, it's all spider is six feet tall

348
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,120
 and scientists would go, well that's impossible.

349
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,680
 You can't have a six foot in diameter spider.

350
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
 Its respiratory system wouldn't work

351
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,560
 and its exoskeleton wouldn't work.

352
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,840
 The biggest creature with an exoskeleton can get on land,

353
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,800
 according to science, is three feet.

354
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
 So when the natives in the area said

355
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
 it was around three to four feet,

356
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,880
 they would describe it as a puppy-sized spider

357
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,620
 or the size of a terrier.

358
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,160
 So when we think giant spider,

359
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,600
 the first thing we think of is like she-both,

360
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
 shulbeth, that one in Lord of the Rings.

361
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,960
 These ones are actually the size of a small dog

362
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,240
 which is in the realm of possibility.

363
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,360
 There is a creature, the largest creature

364
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,080
 with an exoskeleton on land that we have photos of

365
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,420
 and you can actually eat.

366
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,600
 They're called the coconut crab.

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,840
 They sound incredibly tasty,

368
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
 but I don't know if they taste like coconut.

369
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,240
 I think they just eat coconuts.

370
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,740
 They're three feet in diameter.

371
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,000
 So you could have a creature that had a three feet

372
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,640
 in diameter, a exoskeleton creature.

373
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,460
 The question comes is can you have a spider of that size

374
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,720
 because the way the respiratory system works?

375
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
 In science it's like, no,

376
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,080
 the biggest you could have is a foot.

377
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,840
 But I'm going to say that based on the fact,

378
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,600
 this is my professional opinion,

379
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
 the respiratory system,

380
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,240
 there may be a little bit of a work around there.

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
 I have nothing to back that up.

382
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,880
 But the fact that the early stories were saying

383
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,160
 it was six feet and science were like that's impossible,

384
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,080
 but when you go to the locals, they say three to four feet

385
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,480
 and we have exoskeleton creatures

386
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,920
 with three feet in diameter.

387
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,600
 I personally believe that this spider exists.

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,880
 I don't know if it exists right now.

389
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
 It could be extinct.

390
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
 It could have been super plentiful back in the day

391
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,240
 like ancient times,

392
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,240
 but I don't know enough about spider respiratory systems.

393
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,240
 I know right now the biggest spider that we know exists

394
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,160
 is one foot in diameter.

395
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,500
 And I don't think it's like,

396
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,240
 (breathing heavily)

397
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,400
 you know, like that kid from Malcolm the Middle,

398
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,100
 like man, that guy was, I love that show,

399
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,280
 but that character was so annoying to watch.

400
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,120
 It was funny.

401
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
 It just, yeah.

402
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,000
 Anyways, yes, they can't get six feet big.

403
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,680
 Could they get three feet big?

404
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,040
 Likely possible, possible.

405
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,120
 So does this creature exist?

406
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,200
 I think it could.

407
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,400
 I think in the right conditions in the right areas

408
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,920
 with the right food source and things like that,

409
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
 you could have a spider that's three feet big,

410
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,800
 three feet in diameter.

411
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
 It's not like three feet tall.

412
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,680
 Well, three foot in diameter.

413
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,520
 It doesn't matter.

414
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,680
 It's terrifying any other way.

415
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,480
 So now let's talk about the porn video.

416
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,100
 Now, apparently this is how I came to know

417
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,220
 about the Jabu Fofi.

418
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,180
 I think this is how most people know about it.

419
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,420
 There was a porn actress named,

420
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,420
 I'm gonna butcher this as well, Sabenshi Tomatovic.

421
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,180
 She's Australian Serbian pornographic actress,

422
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,300
 Sabenshi Tomatovic.

423
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,540
 You know what, hold on one second.

424
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,780
 I wanna see what she looks like,

425
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,520
 'cause I don't know why I never googled her before.

426
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,960
 Okay, well here's an interesting thing.

427
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,640
 I just tried Googling her and I see no photos of her.

428
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,320
 So I'm kind of thinking now that name is made up

429
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,480
 or the whole story's fake, but not the spider story.

430
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,320
 I believe in that.

431
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,920
 But anyway, so this was some copypasta

432
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,360
 that was going around for a while.

433
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,640
 Australian Serbian pornographic actress,

434
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,840
 Sabenshi Tomatovic reported to close friends and relatives

435
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,280
 being sexually assaulted by a giant spider

436
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
 measuring four foot in size.

437
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 She stated that the encounter propelled her rise to fame

438
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,260
 in Japan's underground Genki Genki circle.

439
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,620
 Genki means excited or pep in Japanese.

440
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,580
 I think it's actually, yeah.

441
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,220
 So that was copypasta that was going around.

442
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,020
 People started looking in to see if it was real or not.

443
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:02,380
 Now, based on what, there's two,

444
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,580
 there's three things that are possible here.

445
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,280
 One, it's completely made up

446
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,960
 and no woman ever paying a spider on film.

447
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,680
 Two, it's real.

448
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,520
 And this actress who somehow, she's a porn actress,

449
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,640
 but somehow has no photos on the internet, which is weird.

450
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,320
 I'll keep, okay.

451
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,200
 But she has no photos on the web.

452
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,960
 This actress, they got a job of fofie,

453
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,560
 some Japanese mafia gangbanger.

454
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,480
 I guess that's kind of redundant, not the Japanese part,

455
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 but some Japanese gangster got one of these spiders

456
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,640
 shipped over from Africa, 'cause why not?

457
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,020
 You have tons and tons of money

458
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,160
 and you put it on video of this woman

459
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,280
 having sex with a spider.

460
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,680
 I don't know how spiders have sex.

461
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,680
 Maybe it weaved itself a dildo and penetrated her.

462
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,840
 Maybe it just went down on her.

463
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,680
 I don't know.

464
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
 You think it would suck her blood out,

465
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,640
 but besides the point.

466
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
 And they have that on video somewhere

467
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,120
 and it's this crazy video.

468
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
 So that assumes that both she is real

469
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,160
 and the job of fofie is real.

470
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,520
 I have the third option here.

471
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,440
 So we have it's fake.

472
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
 We have the spider's real and she's real.

473
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,040
 I have a third option that she's real

474
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,760
 and she didn't have sex with a job of fofie

475
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
 because they don't exist.

476
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,440
 This is just my theory.

477
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,920
 But she had sex with a coconut crab,

478
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,080
 which, I mean, think about it.

479
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,680
 You go to Japan, they tell you

480
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,360
 they're gonna pay $10,000 to be in this video.

481
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,800
 And all of a sudden they bring out a giant creature.

482
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,280
 You're not gonna count its legs.

483
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,600
 That's not gonna be the first thing you think of.

484
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,880
 This three foot long giant crab walks into the room.

485
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
 You're not gonna be like,

486
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,480
 "Oh, actually that is from the genus Crabotoculus.

487
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,520
 That is obviously not an arachnid."

488
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,360
 You're gonna be like,

489
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,400
 "Oh my God, I'm about to have sex with this monster."

490
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,560
 So I think the most likely thing is

491
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,160
 that that part of the story is fake.

492
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,640
 There is no tape of Sabinech Tomatovic

493
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 because being sexually assaulted by a giant spider,

494
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,800
 you think that the first thing you do

495
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,320
 would wever up and eat her blood.

496
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,280
 But maybe if it is true,

497
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,560
 maybe she had sex with this coconut crab.

498
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,120
 So if we assume that this story is true,

499
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,240
 which I mean, why not?

500
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,480
 It's on the internet, right?

501
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,200
 And if the Jabba Fofi doesn't exist

502
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
 because at the end of the day,

503
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,200
 we don't have any proof of that,

504
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,920
 but we do know coconut crabs existed.

505
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,600
 Maybe she banged a coconut crab.

506
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
 And that would actually make more sense

507
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 because it wouldn't immediately kill her.

508
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,640
 You would just rub its shell on her for a while until it came.

509
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
 I don't know how crustaceans have sex either.

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,560
 I don't know if they have genitalia.

511
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,640
 I'm sure they have something.

512
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
 They pinch in each other's butts.

513
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,000
 But if there's a video out there,

514
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,280
 and this actually happened,

515
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
 the most likely scenario is she banged the crab,

516
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,200
 a coconut crab.

517
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,680
 So if that's gonna cause you nightmares

518
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 or make you swear off seafood forever,

519
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,760
 I apologize, it should have put a trigger warning in there.

520
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,440
 I don't know, I don't eat seafood anyways.

521
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,440
 So if you ever do see the Sabina Tomatovich tape,

522
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,440
 count the legs and get back to me.

523
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,440
 So this is a little addendum to the Java fofie

524
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,720
 and the porn tape.

525
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,280
 I don't remember exactly how to pronounce her name.

526
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,720
 I don't have my notes in front of me right now,

527
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,000
 but the Tomatovich tape.

528
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,360
 So I was going back and I was kind of editing

529
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
 and listening back to what I recorded.

530
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
 And then I did some more research.

531
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
 Now she does not exist anywhere.

532
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,720
 And I get that sometimes when you have these stories

533
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,800
 and you have like a person's name, there are nobody.

534
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,920
 So you're not really gonna find them,

535
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,360
 but she's a porn star.

536
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,560
 And it's really hard to not be able to find anything

537
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,840
 on a porn star.

538
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,160
 Their information is constantly getting leaked.

539
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
 I mean, once you do a video, it's everywhere.

540
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,200
 You type in someone's name,

541
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,680
 you can pull up 100 photos of it.

542
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,080
 Sometimes you can show a photo of a girl's calf

543
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,920
 and other people are like,

544
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,680
 oh yeah, that's Amy Ash or whoever.

545
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,720
 I don't know.

546
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,080
 But so she doesn't exist at all.

547
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,240
 So it means again, let me say this.

548
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,080
 I think the story is a hoax

549
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,760
 'cause I wasn't able to find anything about the story

550
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,760
 of Tom Tomovich and the giant spider sex tape

551
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
 other than the same creepypasta

552
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,840
 over and over and over and over again.

553
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,560
 There's never any additional details to it.

554
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,000
 There was never like,

555
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,360
 sometimes when you find these type of stories,

556
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
 one source, you'll read the same thing over and over again,

557
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,600
 but then one source will say that,

558
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
 it was taken during this time period,

559
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,600
 like it happened in the 90s

560
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,200
 or it was in this district of Japan

561
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,640
 or some additional detail that we can go forward is not.

562
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,400
 Somebody made the story up

563
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,280
 and they used a creature that may or may not exist.

564
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,960
 Again, I think it has a likelihood of existing.

565
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,280
 But so I hate to disappoint anyone out there

566
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,920
 who went looking for this tape.

567
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,280
 As far as I can tell, the tape does not exist.

568
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,120
 It never exists.

569
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,640
 It was just creepypasta.

570
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
 And people say, well, I saw footage of it

571
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
 or I saw a screenshot and maybe the reason

572
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
 why you can't find anything on her

573
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,080
 was because she was scrubbed from the internet,

574
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,920
 but we know nothing gets scrubbed from the internet like that.

575
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,120
 But the government could do it.

576
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,120
 No, no, no, you have to be realistic about this stuff.

577
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,040
 On a certain level.

578
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,200
 I mean, we can have fun talking about a sex tape

579
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,040
 with a spider and a woman,

580
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,080
 but if you want to put it forward

581
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,400
 that this exists in some way,

582
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 there's, you need something to back it up

583
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,160
 other than my cousin knew a guy on 4chan

584
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
 who saw a screenshot.

585
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,400
 So unless further information comes forward,

586
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
 the idea of this being a tape is completely ridiculous.

587
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,760
 And it's a hoax.

588
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,520
 Now, there probably are videos of people,

589
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,280
 women having sex with all sorts of weird creature snakes.

590
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,320
 Actually, I know for a fact,

591
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,160
 there's, you know, bestiality videos out there,

592
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,080
 but I'm talking about like exotic creatures,

593
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
 like a six foot python and so on and so forth.

594
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
 And I'm sure those exist.

595
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,440
 And there's possibility that a woman has a porn video

596
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,840
 of having sex with at least a coconut crab,

597
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,480
 which we talked about during the episode.

598
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,440
 But as far as the exact story

599
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,400
 or something even coming close

600
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
 to the story of the Tom and Tomage tape,

601
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
 there's nothing to back it up.

602
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
 She doesn't exist.

603
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,840
 There's no additional information.

604
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,680
 It's the same 40 some odd words posted over and over again.

605
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
 And that is the biggest sign

606
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,080
 that it's just creepypasta and it doesn't exist.

607
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,320
 So that was your fetish.

608
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,840
 I'm sorry to inform you

609
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,640
 that it is likely not true.

610
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,040
 I'm gonna put that in very, very, very, very,

611
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,400
 very unlikely that it's true.

612
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,160
 But I still hold out hope

613
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,640
 that the Jabba Fofi is a real creature.

617
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,920
 I think the idea of a giant spider.

618
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,160
 Oh, and I have to say this quick too.

619
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,960
 One of the first things that turned me on,

620
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
 not in a porn way,

621
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,000
 that turned me on to the idea of giant spiders.

622
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
 I'm gonna include this link below.

623
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,160
 Was there is a story in France back at the turn of the century

624
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,840
 where near the entrance to the catacombs of Paris,

625
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,080
 people were disappearing

626
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,680
 and the cops increased their patrols in the area.

627
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,360
 And one day a cop was walking on the street

628
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,960
 and he heard someone singing

629
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
 and he saw like a guy walking,

630
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,440
 like he was hypnotized into this tomb of Isidor,

631
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,840
 I think it's called.

632
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,960
 The cop followed him in there and there was a giant spider.

633
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,080
 And again, it's listed as a giant spider,

634
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,520
 but when you read the definition,

635
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,040
 it was the size of a small dog.

636
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
 It was the size of a terrier.

637
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,640
 So it would three feet is believable.

638
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,560
 And so the cop tried shooting any could it

639
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,040
 and the other cops heard the commotion

640
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,960
 and they all shot it.

641
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
 And apparently they killed the spider,

642
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,560
 but the guy was dead

643
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,840
 and they put the spider in a museum, the end.

644
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,760
 I always thought it was a fascinating story.

645
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,040
 I read that in 40 in times.

646
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,680
 It was horrific enough and believable enough

647
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,600
 to my 15 year old mind that it was true,

648
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
 but here I am at 41 still believing

649
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,120
 or still talking about the possibility

650
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,160
 that giant spiders exist.

651
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,480
 So some things never change.

652
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,760
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal

653

655
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

656
