1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 When professional Bigfoot Hunters come face to face with the mythical monster himself,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,280
 they believe they finally have validation for their life's work.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,880
 Instead, they find themselves embroiled in a bizarre religion.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,720
 And then we meet a young woman who recently lost her sister to a drug overdose.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,760
 While she's still grieving her sister's death, paranormal events begin to plague the household.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,360
 Is it possible that her sister is trying to send a message from beyond the grave?

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
 Or is a more sinister force slowly invading the household?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,020
 [Music]

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,520
 A great day for me with a little asterisk again.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,360
 Long time listeners, not long time listeners of the show if you've been listening to the

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
 other episodes this week.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,320
 I have an earache, my tongue sore and all that stuff.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,640
 But I don't want to just complain about the physical ailments that I have unless you

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 have a cure.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,800
 I have a peel box if you have medicine to send me for this.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,480
 Go ahead and send it to my peel box.

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
 That's legal.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,440
 Don't send me a bunch of narcotics is my eyes shift from side to side.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,320
 Speaking of someone who often sends me narcotics, I'm ratting you out to the FBI.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,080
 It's one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,640
 Give it up for everyone's best friend, Bill Gates.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,880
 Everyone give a round of applause to Bill Gates walking into Dead Rabbit Command, smuggling

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,000
 in the drugs I need for my pain.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,960
 Bill, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,480
 Patreon or if you don't know friends who have drugs, that's fine too.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,120
 Now Bill, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys.

32
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,860
 Oh, and we're not even so, we got to do Fan Art Friday too, I forgot.

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320
 Look at this submission for Fan Art Friday.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,720
 This is from our subreddit, the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,160
 It's from Fight Me and Unreal.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,840
 This is the anatomy of a Dead Rabbit Radio episode.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,840
 He has it listed as 80% paranormal stuff, 20% Jason making weird noises with his mouth.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,320
 I think that's fairly accurate and very, very funny.

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,640
 I liked it when I saw it and I was thinking about it.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,680
 I wanted to profile it in Fan Art Friday.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,960
 Thank you so much for creating that Fight Me and Unreal.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
 Really, really cool.

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,600
 If you guys have other Fan Art Friday, just go ahead and send it to me however you guys

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,080
 get a hold of me and we will see about profiling that as well.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
 Bill Gape, so I'm going to go ahead and we're going to start making mouth noises.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,280
 Bill Gape, so I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,160
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,880
 We are headed on out to North Carolina.

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,200
 Bill Gape is driving us out to North Carolina.

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
 Specifically we're headed to the Pizga National Park.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,160
 It's in the mountains of McDowell County and we're driving through the woods.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 It's beautiful out.

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,440
 Little birds, chirpons, squirrels are just walking around, storing nuts for the winter.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,280
 And while we're driving through the woods and we're looking at all this nature stuff, there's

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,760
 actually about seven dudes walking through the woods.

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,920
 And this is Bigfoot 911.

57
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,520
 It's a Bigfoot research group.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,600
 They go out, they spend their weekends in the woods looking for the mythical man himself.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,680
 Will they ever find him?

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
 You know, Bigfoot, people have been searching for him in modern times, really since the

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
 1950s.

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,720
 It's been 60 years at this point.

63
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,360
 And every year that passes, you lose a little more faith that Bigfoot's going to show up.

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
 But what a hobby to have, right?

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,800
 Like how many people's hobbies allow them to walk around in the woods with their buddies?

66
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 It's really cool.

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,040
 Like whether or not they ever find Bigfoot or Sasquatch, it's cool.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,600
 I think that's always fun about ghost hunting too.

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,480
 Whether or not you find Proof of Ghost or Sea Ghost.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,680
 It's all about having fun, the bonding memories.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,200
 Like I used to remember hanging out with Steve and Mauricio and Josh and Jason and all these

72
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
 people.

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
 Ghost hunting, right?

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,800
 Jackie and Liz.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
 We enjoy this stuff.

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,480
 So whether or not, I mean I did see Ghost.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
 It's quite traumatizing.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,800
 But it's the memories too.

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,480
 So I'm not, do I think they're ever going to find Bigfoot?

80
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
 Probably not.

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,560
 But it'll be fun.

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 It's a fun journey.

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
 It's a fun journey.

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
 Just don't get too obsessed about it.

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,720
 But anyways, this group, Bigfoot911, is led by a guy named John Bruner.

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
 And it's nighttime.

87
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
 And they're walking around with these glow sticks.

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 They're kind of like holding them out.

89
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 I don't know why glow sticks.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 I don't know.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
 And maybe they had flashlights as well.

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,920
 Maybe they just got done going to one of their nephew's birthday parties and they had all

93
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 these glow sticks.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
 And they're like, "Let's save money on batteries."

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,760
 But on August 4th, 2017, they're walking through the forest and using these glow sticks,

96
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,120
 they find him.

97
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
 They find Bigfoot.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,640
 You guys didn't hear about this in the news?

99
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,160
 You didn't guys hear about this proof?

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,080
 Bigfoot exists?

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,800
 Now this story was sent to me by our Bigfoot expert, Bennett.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,120
 He sent us a ton of stuff about Bigfoot stories.

103
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,640
 He's really big into pig people.

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,480
 He found a list of every pigman legend in every state.

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
 I think there was only three states that don't have a pigman legend.

106
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,800
 I'm still going through that list.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,240
 Bennett always emails me Bigfoot stories and Pig People stories.

108
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,560
 And then he always says, "Listen, I'm not really into Bigfoot.

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 I'm just doing this.

110
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 Uh-huh.

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
 Sure.

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 Sure you are, Bennett."

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,280
 Bennett is a member of Bigfoot911.

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,320
 He's throwing the glow sticks.

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,200
 He's throwing them so hard and fast.

116
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,920
 Good job, Bennett.

117
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
 Thank you for this recommendation.

118
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,880
 He always does send really good stuff.

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,320
 They're throwing these glow sticks and Bigfoot starts picking up rocks and throwing them

120
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,280
 at Bigfoot911 and then runs away from the scene.

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,080
 But they saw him.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
 They saw Bigfoot.

123
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,760
 Which is, like I said, I've seen ghosts and I've seen demons and I've seen demonically

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,480
 possessed people.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,280
 But I have to say, maybe it's because I've seen those things, I'm fairly jaded because

126
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
 you're, "Oh, great.

127
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
 Your loved ones head spinning around.

128
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
 They're vomiting blood and speaking to Latin."

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 You're like, "Uh-huh.

130
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,280
 You've seen one demonic possession.

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
 You've seen them all."

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,880
 I think I'd be really impressed to see Bigfoot or an alien.

133
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,560
 Like if I look at the scale of, I've seen ghosts and I've seen demons.

134
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,840
 Maybe if I saw a named demon, like Gamigen or Balbarith or Lucifer, like one of the

135
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,400
 named dudes, I might be a little impressed.

136
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
 But if I saw Gamigen, I'd ride him around.

137
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
 He's actually a demonic donkey.

138
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,480
 But seeing Bigfoot would be, that would be cool.

139
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,880
 Like clearly seeing Bigfoot, not like you see something in the woods that might be a

140
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,440
 bear, like clearly seeing Bigfoot.

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,800
 I'd rank it a "Blow an Alien."

142
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,240
 Like I'd rather see a sexy alien.

143
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,920
 You're like, "Jayson, didn't you say you don't want to get too rambly?"

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
 I'd rather see a sexy alien.

145
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,600
 Like a sexy humanoid reptilian.

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,320
 I mean, I actually do have a sexy human.

147
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,960
 It's a sexy human alien.

148
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,240
 That was a total Freudian slip.

149
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,840
 Then a sexy reptilian.

150
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
 Then a sexy gray.

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,200
 And then like a normal alien.

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,720
 Like I'll lump all those together.

153
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,440
 Like if it's just a normal alien, it could be a reptilian or gray or human.

154
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 It doesn't matter.

155
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,440
 Robot.

156
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,800
 And then Bigfoot.

157
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
 And then like maybe another cryptid.

158
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,360
 This has become a tier list on the S level.

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,440
 I have sexy aliens.

160
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,560
 Any other cryptid.

161
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,920
 But Bigfoot would be cool.

162
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,560
 Like I saw Bigfoot clearly so I could do the woods.

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
 A bunch of glow sticks.

164
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,480
 I just came from Party City, USA.

165
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
 But they saw Bigfoot.

166
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,000
 That happened on August 4th, 2017.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,600
 So you think, I mean a lot of people claim they see Bigfoot.

168
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,600
 It doesn't really make national news unless there's proof.

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,640
 Well on August 9th, I don't know how this passed my attention.

170
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,320
 I wasn't doing the podcast at the time.

171
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,840
 But thanks Bennett for bringing this to my attention.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,640
 On August 9th, 2017, Bigfoot held a press conference.

173
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 What happened was Bigfoot did hold a press conference.

174
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,520
 Bigfoot turns out to be a man named Gaywin McGregor.

175
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,920
 He's a 36 year old dude.

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,520
 All this time people have been looking for Bigfoot.

177
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,480
 Turns out it was just some guy named Gaywin living in North Carolina.

178
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,680
 Gaywin comes forward and goes, "Guys, I know that Bigfoot 911 said that they saw Bigfoot."

179
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,480
 And they did in a sense because I am Bigfoot.

180
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,880
 Gaywin has built a Bigfoot suit out of raccoon fur.

181
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,080
 And it looks as gross as you think it would.

182
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,280
 It looks like a guy covered himself in glue and rolled down a hill of roadkill and carcasses

183
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 of animals.

184
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,480
 And it's just this patchwork of fur.

185
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,720
 You can, I mean, it looks nothing like you would expect Bigfoot to look, other than

186
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,120
 it's big and it's hairy.

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,520
 But then like, people's dads could be mistaken for Bigfoot.

188
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
 This guy, his eyes are all jacked up.

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,160
 I mean, this guy's not, he's not the best costume designer.

190
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,080
 It's just him covered in raccoon fur.

191
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,560
 And he goes, "Listen, I was in the woods at Pishka National Park that night.

192
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
 It was 11 PM."

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,600
 As Jason looked back over at his notes.

194
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,520
 I was there that night.

195
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,480
 But I didn't throw rocks.

196
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,000
 So the police are like, "Oh, you were there when you were throwing rocks?"

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 No, no, I didn't throw rocks.

198
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
 I didn't assault them.

199
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,640
 But the Bigfoot they saw was me.

200
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
 And people are like, "What?"

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,120
 So was it a hoax where you're running around in the woods to scare people?

202
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
 Were you in on it?

203
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,080
 Like, did you know Bigfoot 911 is going to be there and you're trying to be part of

204
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
 this hoax and get them publicity?

205
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 And he goes, "None of that.

206
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
 What?

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
 That's foolish.

208
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

209
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 And he goes, "I'm not going to be there until I get to the police.

210
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police."

211
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 And he goes, "I'm not going to be there until I get to the police.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police."

213
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 And he goes, "I'm not going to be there until I get to the police.

214
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

216
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

218
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

219
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 I'm going to be there until I get to the police.

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 So, this is a character from the book or story Gilgamesh,

222
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 which I've never read.

223
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 Apparently, it's like the oldest novel ever written.

224
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 It's about this dude who's like, "I'm the best dude on the planet."

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 Like his mom's a goddess and like his dad,

226
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 his dad's just like the moon or something like that.

227
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 And he shows up on Earth and he's like pushing people around.

228
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 He's really strong.

229
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 So when he's pushing villagers down, they're like,

230
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 "Ah, they're flying like a couple miles away."

231
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
 "No, we needed that villager.

232
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 He was the only one who could construct the aqueducts."

233
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
 "Ah, you don't need aqueducts."

234
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 Just worship me.

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 Gilgamesh is like this king walking around Samaria or something like that.

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 And everyone's like, "Dude, this guy's like really cool

237
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 because he's super strong and he's like a decent leader, I guess."

238
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 I mean, we keep losing one-tenth of our population

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 every time he walks through our village.

240
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 So the mom, his mom is like looking down on Earth

241
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 and being like, "You know what?

242
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 My son needs to learn a little bit of humility."

243
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 So the mom goes, "What I need to do is create a big, giant hairy dude."

244
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
 "To wrestle him."

245
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
 That will teach my son to have more manners.

246
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 So she creates this dude named Enkidu,

247
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 who is two-thirds, he described as two-thirds monster, one-third man.

248
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
 His body is covered in fur.

249
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 And he represented the nature that mankind had abandoned to live in the cities.

250
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 So he comes walking into town and Gilgamesh is like,

251
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 "Oh, finally like a challenge.

252
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
 Like, I've been pushing over these villagers.

253
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 Like, they're nothing."

254
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
 So him and this furry dude start wrestling

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
 and then they become friends.

256
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 It's just like when you were in school and your bully's like,

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 "I'm gonna beat you up after school."

258
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 And you're like, "After school, let's go right now."

259
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 And you're like boxing on the playground.

260
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 And the bully's like, "Ah, dude, you're actually not so bad."

261
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
 He's being wheeled into the hospital.

262
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 He's being wheeled in because you would beat him up.

263
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 You broke all of his ribs.

264
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
 "Ah, let's hang out tomorrow."

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 And you're like, "Yeah, sure."

266
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 You know, like when you fight a dude, there's a level of respect for him.

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 It's like that.

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 He's wrestling this guy and then that actually calms down Gilgamesh, apparently.

269
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 Based on the Wikipedia that I've read and slightly remember.

270
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 That is the plot of the world's oldest novel.

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 And then eventually, Inkidoo dies because he's not a deity in the sense that Gilgamesh is.

272
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 And Gilgamesh always was super sad.

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 Like, he's like, "Oh, no, that was my best friend."

274
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 Like, he was super furry and we cuddled at night and he was warm.

275
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 And we wrestled a lot.

276
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
 Wait a second, bro, what?

277
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 We thought he was just like your Robin to your Batman.

278
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 You were cuddling at night and he was warm.

279
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 "Forgot all that stuff."

280
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 Gilgamesh said, "As he started pushing villagers around, forget it.

281
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 Forget it."

282
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
 The point is, everyone should remember what a cool dude Inkidoo was.

283
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 And most people do, like English majors, probably remember who Inkidoo is.

284
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 And history people, probably remember historians, what they're normally called.

285
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 Historians probably remember Inkidoo.

286
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 And I didn't know about this guy.

287
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 I've never read Gilgamesh.

288
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 He's very, very, very...

289
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 You've made it perfectly clear you have never read Gilgamesh.

290
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 But he's like, whatever, it sounds dope pushing people around.

291
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
 Then Harry dude shows up.

292
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
 The end.

293
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 But I've never heard of this guy.

294
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
 Well, apparently Gaywin has.

295
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 Learned this stuff.

296
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 And he believes that Inkidoo is the original Sasquatch.

297
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 Which I could see that.

298
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 I could see where their beliefs at.

299
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
 So he created this religion called Inkidooism.

300
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 And he dresses up as Bigfoot and he goes into nature and he telepathically bonds with Bigfoot.

301
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 By dressing as the Sasquatch, he goes, "Shawmans would dress as the fox or dressed as the wolf."

302
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 I'm dressing as who I want to communicate with.

303
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 I'm dressing as Bigfoot.

304
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 And I'm dressing as Bigfoot.

305
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 And it's made out of this raccoon fur.

306
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 I go into the woods and he has a Bigfoot prayer.

307
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 Which when I read that I was like, "Oh dude, this is going to be so funny."

308
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 And it's not.

309
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 It's kind of boring.

310
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 But I'll read it to you anyways.

311
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 Just in case you ever need it.

312
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 Right now you're listening to this podcast and Bigfoot's pounding on your cab.

313
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 And you're like, "Please read it.

314
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
 Please read it out loud."

315
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 Here's the Bigfoot prayer.

316
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 Here I'll shut my closet door so it'll be extra spooky while I say it.

317
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 "Deo Sasquatch, children of Inkidoo, in your great mercy may you walk forever before me,

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 guiding me through the forest and guarding me from every danger that may come."

319
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 Dude, if you're going to make up a religion, make it funny.

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 You know what I mean?

321
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 Make it funny.

322
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 Religions aren't supposed to be funny.

323
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 They're supposed to be sacred.

324
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 Yeah, but you could have like a total funny one like Bigfoot.

325
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,600
 When I was walking along the beach there was two set of feet prints, mine and these giant ones.

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 But then soon I realized there was only a giant pair of footprints.

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 You know, stuff like that.

328
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
 You could do a bunch of funny stuff like Amazing Grace, but it's Amazing Race.

329
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 Because he has big feet.

330
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 He's always running away from you.

331
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 I don't know something funny.

332
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 Be more funny is what religions I think would get a lot more adherents if they were funny.

333
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 So I'm a little disappointed.

334
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 But anyway, so he says that was me.

335
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 Now here, I have it.

336
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 I'm not just going on for 20 minutes about this.

337
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 Here is what I find so fascinating about this story.

338
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 Like the guy coming up his own religion, that's fine.

339
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 We've come across stuff like that before.

340
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 Again, work on the prayer.

341
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
 Make it clever.

342
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 What I find more fascinating about this is the fact that I'm bullying in this guy's religion is this.

343
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 John Brunner says no.

344
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 That wasn't him that we saw in the woods that night.

345
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,600
 He says what we saw was eight feet tall and gay when it's not eight feet tall.

346
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 And there's photographs of him in this gross outfit.

347
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 And John Brunner goes, "That is not what we saw in the woods."

348
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 If we had seen that in the woods, we would have known it was a man in a suit.

349
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 Even at 11 p.m. we would have known that was not a real person.

350
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 That was not the real bigfoot.

351
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 They also said it ran so quickly.

352
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 No human could run that fast.

353
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 So it could be John Brunner's saving face because he didn't want to admit that his group saw this guy in this suit

354
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 and actually thought it was bigfoot.

355
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 But what I think is fascinating, we're going to finish it up like this.

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 You have a team of bigfoot researchers and they have all this gear.

357
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 They have all the glow sticks money can buy.

358
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 They're out there looking for a bigfoot.

359
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 Bigfoot shows up.

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
 It is most likely gay one in this suit.

361
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 And because it's dark and it's all lit by glow sticks that, you know, you can mistake the suit.

362
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 But they didn't get a photo of him.

363
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 These are bigfoot researchers out there.

364
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 Out there with all the technology to hunt bigfoot.

365
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
 They don't get a photo of him.

366
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
 Here's my conspiracy theory.

367
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 What if?

368
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 Because we know there's very, very few photos of bigfoot.

369
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
 There's a new video that made the rounds and it's like a two second long video.

370
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 I was super disappointed.

371
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 I saw the screenshot.

372
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
 I'll go, "That looks intriguing."

373
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
 It's like a two second video and people are like, "This has to be fake."

374
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 Like, "Who records two seconds of a video?"

375
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 I'll put it in the show notes.

376
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 It looks interesting, but it's just, it doesn't make sense to why you would only record two seconds.

377
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 But what if we know that it's hard to take photographs of UFOs.

378
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 It's hard to take photographs of bigfoot.

379
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 Ghosts seem to be the easiest thing to photograph and even those are fairly hard.

380
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,600
 I'm not talking about orbs because there's aren't ghosts.

381
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 But what if you can't take a photo of bigfoot?

382
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
 Like, that's just, it's some sort of paranormal thing.

383
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
 The photo turns out being blurry.

384
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
 The camera doesn't work.

385
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 But what if it extends past that?

386
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 What if you can't even take a photo of a fake bigfoot?

387
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 A fake bigfoot.

388
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
 I think about that.

389
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 They were ready to take all these photos.

390
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 They were hunting this monster.

391
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
 One appears and even though it wasn't the real bigfoot, there would be no reason why cameras would fail.

392
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 There would be no sort of high strangeness or paranormal activity messing with their technology.

393
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 Even a fake bigfoot they're unable to take a photograph of.

394
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 That's fascinating to me.

395
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 Like, even if you're dressed up in the suit and not the real creature for whatever reason,

396
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 you don't take a photo of it.

397
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Now, it could be that it's so shocking.

398
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 You don't remember your cameras there, but remember, these are professional bigfoot hunters.

399
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,600
 This is kind of what they're there for, is to document this stuff.

400
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 I wonder if, now I'm put on our conspiracy cap, because this is kind of like just a train of thought,

401
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 but if you could have special forces all over the world, dress up like monsters, you have spets, gnats,

402
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
 you have Russian special forces, they're like, "I want to suck your blood!"

403
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 They're in these really cheap Dracula costumes.

404
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,600
 People are like, "Ah, what if you had special forces, assassins, scouts, and they're dressed like cryptids?"

405
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 They don't show up on...

406
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 The government doesn't know why this works.

407
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 They go, "We don't get it. If we send in a team of Navy SEALs into enemy territory,

408
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 they may get picked up on sensors and stuff like that, but if we take those Navy SEALs,

409
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
 we dress them up like the monster squad.

410
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 You have a werewolf, the mummy too, creature from the Black Lagoon swimming in your pool.

411
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 They're all showing up. They don't get picked up on sensors.

412
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 Photographs, video cameras don't work. They're all blurry.

413
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 I don't know. That's the conspiracy cap thing, but I do find it very interesting that even in the face of a fake Bigfoot,

414
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 they still can't take a picture, because it makes sense when you're face-to-face with the real Bigfoot.

415
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 We've had stories of there's some disturbance in the area, or they lost time, however you want to describe it.

416
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 A fake Bigfoot would have none of that stuff, and they still can't take a photo.

417
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 Very, very interesting story. Bennett, thank you so much for sending it over.

418
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 Bill Gape's.

419
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 I'm going to toss you the keys of the Carbner Copter. We are leaving behind North Carolina.

420
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 We are headed on out to a small town in the middle of America.

421
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 [imitates car engine]

422
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 This is one of those stories. I get why people are hesitant to give out their information online.

423
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,600
 But we don't have a name for any of the people involved, so we'll be making those names up.

424
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,600
 We don't have a location, but we do have a period of time, and it was actually just earlier this year.

425
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 A couple months ago, this all started. This was written by a user known as Blendx3.

426
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 A 34-year-old married woman has a daughter. Everything's going okay, but her sister has a drug problem.

427
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 She doesn't live with her sister, it's her younger sister, but when a family member has an addiction,

428
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 the whole family has the addiction. And she loves her younger sister.

429
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 She remembers the good times they had together before she spiraled into this drug use.

430
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 One of the hobbies that her younger sister had was she was a ghost hunter.

431
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,600
 Which, again, great, great hobby. You may not have to this story, you may reconsider it,

432
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,600
 but it's just such a fun thing to do. Look to see, yeah, that's good, I think.

433
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 See if there's any ghost hunting groups in your area, you might make a really good group of friends.

434
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 Even if it's just online, have a little group, you know, yeah, I recommend that.

435
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 Let's call, so we're going to call the narrator of this story.

436
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 We're going to call her Rebecca. These names are all shots in the dark, and then we're going to call her sister, Melissa.

437
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 Well, earlier this year, Rebecca gets a phone call from her mom. It's panicked.

438
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 Her mom's in a panic, and she goes, "Listen, Rebecca, I need you to go make sure all the doors in the house are locked.

439
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Go, make sure, and Rebecca's like, "What's going on?" Mom's like, "Listen, Melissa is, she might come by.

440
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 She might come by. Make sure your doors are locked. If she comes to your house, don't let her in.

441
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 Call 911." Now, nobody wants to get a phone call like that, even with someone who's addicted to drugs.

442
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 I mean, life can be chaotic from time to time, but it looks like Melissa was actually dangerous.

443
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 Not breaking in your house, stealing your purse, taking some money to go buy her drug of choice, but threatening people.

444
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,600
 That type of phone called Lock Your Doors. Don't let your sister, don't let the little girl that you grew up with inside your house.

445
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 And it frightened Rebecca. She was worried about her child. She was worried about her husband, and she was worried about herself and her sister's well-being as well.

446
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 So it's not the perfect situation, but she never stops wanting to see her little sister return to that woman she once was.

447
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 But earlier this year, around May, June, in that time period, Melissa dies of a drug overdose.

448
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 And for the first six weeks after this untimely death, Rebecca just has a really hard time of dealing with it.

449
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:57,600
 Like she said, "Every single day I was crying. Every single day I was breaking down. It was just that loss and that powerlessness and that rage."

450
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 First six weeks this is going on.

451
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 One weekend, she goes to the cemetery and she meets Melissa's ex-boyfriend at the cemetery, and they're talking a bit and they're reminiscing.

452
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 And the boyfriend, let's call him Charles, he tells Rebecca, he goes, "You know, this... I don't know if this is the right thing I should be saying, but, you know, Melissa was a big ghost hunter.

453
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 She was really into this stuff. And the night she died, before I knew that she had passed away, it was late at night,

454
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
 me and my current girlfriend are sleeping in bed in my place.

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
 And my girlfriend wakes up in the middle of the night. Something startles her.

456
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 And in the darkness of the room, she saw something standing next to the bed, on my side, staring down at me.

457
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 It looked like this figure was trying to wake me up.

458
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 But once it realized that my girlfriend was watching it, this phantom, this shape slowly started to walk away from the bed and then disappeared.

459
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,600
 So the next morning, when I got the phone call, that Melissa had died, my girlfriend wasn't surprised.

460
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 My girlfriend says, "I think I saw her last night. Come to you."

461
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 And my girlfriend grew up in a house that was haunted. She knows the signs to look for.

462
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 And she immediately felt the energy in the house change.

463
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 Just like the house she grew up in, this house was now haunted as well.

464
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 But it's not just an unusual feeling as we walk through the house.

465
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 Just yesterday, a bowl in the kitchen just sitting there exploded into ceramic shards.

466
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 So something's in my house and I don't know what its plans are.

467
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 It's probably Melissa. Maybe she's upset about my girlfriend, but I don't know, I just figured you want to know.

468
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 Rebecca said that after this cemetery visit, she felt better. She no longer was on the edge every day.

469
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 It wasn't like she was gasping for air. She still was sad. She still missed her sister.

470
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 But it wasn't this daily chaos.

471
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 Things were starting to settle down in her heart.

472
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:47,600
 One week after the cemetery, and this is the day she leaves this post online, she's sitting at home at night.

473
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,600
 Her daughter's not feeling good. She's trying to take care of her, comfort her as much as she can.

474
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
 She's puttering around the house, doing chores, keeping an eye on her daughter.

475
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 Her husband's not there. Her mother, who lives with them, she has a little apartment in the basement.

476
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 She's out as well. She's out on a date. So Rebecca kind of has the house to herself, but her daughter's sick.

477
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 But you know what I mean? She's just kind of moving around the house. Her daughter's getting some rest.

478
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 And at a certain point in the night, she realizes, wait a second, where's my dog?

479
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,600
 Where's my dog at? My dog is normally right between my legs, constantly following me around.

480
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,600
 And she realizes she has no idea where her dog is. But whatever.

481
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,600
 You know, dogs tend to be a little goofy sometimes. Could be off doing something in the house.

482
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 She has a sick daughter to take care of, but at one point, her daughter needs something.

483
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,600
 She needs something to treat her daughter, and it's in her mom's room.

484
00:26:48,600 --> 00:27:02,600
 Mom's room is in the basement. She walks down the stairs, and she sees, in the darkness of the basement, her dog and her cat just sitting there, staring at the back door.

485
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 She's like, what? That answers the question where the dog's at, but why is the dog here? What are they looking at?

486
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,600
 But whatever. She has a sick daughter, dogs and dogs are weird, cats are lazy, there's probably a reasonable explanation for this.

487
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 As she begins to approach her mom's room, she feels unwelcome.

488
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:48,600
 The daughter of mom's room seems forbidden, and in the darkness of her mom's room, something is emanating hostile thoughts.

489
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:56,600
 You're not welcome here. Leave now. This isn't your place. Go.

490
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 But she needs this medicine. She needs this treatment for her daughter.

491
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 As a child, when we have those feelings, we tend to leave the area. We don't go down dark hallways. We don't like the certain room in our house.

492
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 We don't like the moldy basement or the spooky attic.

493
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 But as an adult, we give those feelings from time to time. You have to brush them off because you have adult responsibilities.

494
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,600
 And at first you're thinking, "Maybe I'm just a little weird because it's dark down here and spooky, the animals are acting weird."

495
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,600
 So she goes to go into the mom's room to get this stuff out.

496
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:42,600
 But the panic sets in. At a certain point she realizes this isn't just me being paranoid. Something is telling me to leave.

497
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,600
 She grabs what she needs out of her mom's room and she runs out of there, runs back upstairs.

498
00:28:50,600 --> 00:29:00,600
 And on her way through the house, she's turning on the lights. The kitchen light is on, the living room light is on, the lights in the hall are on.

499
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 And she's sitting there in her own house and she is unwelcome. It's spread from the basement. It's spread up the stairs.

500
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 And into all the other rooms of her house, she doesn't feel safe where she's at.

501
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 The post ends where it's three in the morning now and she doesn't want to go to the bathroom. She has to go to the bathroom.

502
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,600
 But she's basically retreated into a single room. She doesn't feel safe in her own house.

503
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 And it ends like this, "I'm so uncomfortable in my own home and I have never felt like this. How can I find out if she is here? And how can I get her to go if she is?"

504
00:29:50,600 --> 00:30:04,600
 So the idea is that Rebecca has, is that this is the ghost of Melissa coming back from beyond the veil to haunt Rebecca's house.

505
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 But is it? This is such an interesting story because we have a couple different things going on.

506
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 One, we could have the idea that this is the ghost of Melissa. Why would she be so hostile to her own sister?

507
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:28,600
 We don't know the full relationship. See, we know Rebecca's side of the story, but Rebecca does say that she did care about Melissa. She loved her sister.

508
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 But if Melissa's coming back from the dead, we could see her messing with the ex-boyfriend and the boyfriend's current girlfriend, which would still require a fairly malevolent spirit.

509
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 A lot of times spirits come back and they'll forgive people. "I know that you weren't able to come to my funeral. I now see why you made the decisions you did."

510
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 Breaking bowls. And that's high level poltergeist activity. Like, that's not very common.

511
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 Assuming this story is true, right? The story could be totally made up. Anything we cover on the show could be totally made up.

512
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 But assuming this story is true, that's high level paranormal phenomenon. Breaking things. Exploding them. Not even knocking them off a shelf.

513
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:18,600
 So she would come back, she'd be very, very malicious. And you would have to think, "Here's our first conspiracy cat moment. Is the ghost of a drug addict still addicted to their drug of choice?"

514
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 People who are like hardcore drug addicts of heroin. Or not even heroin, like people who are hardcore addicts of anything. Gambling or sex.

515
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 You would imagine at a certain point that does that addiction stop being a physical one and become a soul addiction. It's actually affecting your soul.

516
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,600
 And if you die in the grasp of that, and say, "I don't think so." I don't think so. But conspiracy cat fully on, could it be?

517
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 So, I mean, that could be, right? We have to accept that if we believe in ghosts, it's possible there is some sort of lingering addiction issues in that.

518
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 It's weird. I never thought about that before. Would the ghost of a drug addict still be addicted to something?

519
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,600
 Because we do have stories of like ghost committing sex crimes and things like that. So why wouldn't the...

520
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 But I originally... This was my original hypothesis. We may go back to that one. My original hypothesis was...

521
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 It's not her sister. I don't think it's her sister.

522
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 I think when you're a ghost hunter, you make enemies. You do. When you're a Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot doesn't take it personally.

523
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 Me like that you spend time in great outdoors. We friends in the end. He's able to evade your cameras anyways.

524
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,600
 Bigfoot, he's pretty neutral. I think when you look at a D&D alignment scheme, Bigfoot would be neutral.

525
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 But demons are chaotic evil. And ghosts, I think, it could be that you're, you know, a beloved one saying goodbye to you one last time.

526
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,600
 That's a good ghost. And then you have neutral ghosts that are just the recordings of Mary, Queen of Scots with no head walking down the hallway.

527
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:08,600
 And then we have ghosts knocking over bowls and making people feel uncomfortable in their own house. That would be, again, an evil ghost.

528
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 And when you're a ghost hunter and when you're looking into the stuff, you can rack up an enemy's list quite easily.

529
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:22,600
 Now, I don't know the extent of her ghost hunting. That's why I'm saying when you talk about it being a hobby, out of the difference between looking up at the stars for UFOs,

530
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,600
 hunting Bigfoot or ghost hunting, I think ghost hunting is the most dangerous of the three.

531
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
 Hunting hunting is probably the most dangerous because you're going to get gored by an elk or something like that.

532
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 But ghost hunting tends to lead you into demonic hunting, right? You're, you, the two have such crossover.

533
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 And you start to rack up an enemy's list. You're basically making yourself know. And most people live their life, never really coming into contact with any sort of criminal activity.

534
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 You might get mugged. You might get beat up at some point in your life. But you don't have any idea of the criminal networks that are underlying in your area.

535
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 You may read them about them in the newspaper. If you become a bounty hunter and you make your money getting people who've skipped bond,

536
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 if you're a police officer and you make your living investigating crimes, you're now on their radar. They will know who you are.

537
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 The gangs will know who you are. And that's what you do when you become a ghost hunter. You're really putting yourself out there.

538
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:26,600
 So any sort of demonic activity, if you're any good at it, like if you're a really bad bail bondsman or you're a cop and you never really arrest anyone,

539
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 then you're never, you, again, you'll probably just have a passing knowledge of this stuff. But if you're slightly good at any of these jobs, ghost hunting or bounty hunting,

540
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,600
 you will come to the attention of the people that you are hunting and they'll be like, Hey, did you hear what happened to last week?

541
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 Last week, Benny got popped. Yeah, some dude, Jason Carpenter, came into this bar that Benny was at and some guy showed up.

542
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 I guess his name is Jason. The bartender said he identified himself as Jason and he took Benny away and then they would find out through different means,

543
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 court documents or whatever that my name is Jason Carpenter and I was the guy who got their friend.

544
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 And so when you hunt ghosts, you actually can rack up an enemy's list. You can rack up a list of entities who know who you are.

545
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 And I think it's, this is my theory that the sister has moved on. The sister is at peace and no longer addicted to drugs and feels bad about it,

546
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:27,600
 but is now in a place where you don't feel bad. The sister is moved on. She's at peace. She's in a better place, literally.

547
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 But what is coming to the house is not Melissa. It's something more sinister than that.

548
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 It's making her living family members feel unwelcome. It's scaring them. It's terrifying them.

549
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:55,600
 And whatever this thing is, is doing a good job at it. And in a genius way, it is destroying Melissa's legacy.

550
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 Because Melissa wasn't perfect and they've all had bad interactions with this young woman.

551
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:14,600
 But they are going to now think that Melissa hated them so much, was so broken and damaged in life that she continues to haunt them in death.

552
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:24,600
 There's the old saying, "Beware if you stare into the abyss, eventually the abyss will stare back." And that's true.

553
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 But in this case, the abyss did more than just stare back. Something crawled out of it. And it's taken Melissa's memory, twisted it, perverted it, and now lives as her on earth.

554
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:55,600
 It will test Rebecca's love for her lost sister, pushing her to the edge, making her fear her sister even more now than she did when she was alive.

555
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 After all, when Melissa was alive, you could always lock the door and call 911.

556
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:16,600
 But now that something has taken her place in death, it's always in the home. Always watching. Always waiting. Always standing in the darkness.

557
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:26,600
 Ready to make this young family pay dearly, because Melissa stared into the abyss.
