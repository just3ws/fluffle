1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Is it possible for aliens to cure diseases and humans?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we travel to the Philippines. The year is 1986.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And the people of the country are ready for revolution.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 The leader, Ferdinand Marcos, is ready to put it down no matter the cost.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But when the protesters and the military clash, the Virgin Mary appears today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Actually, I think I'm coming down with something. It's not corona. Not coronavirus.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm running nose and stuff for eight hours last night, which is rare for me. It's very rare.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Even on days where I don't have to work, I'm usually up at route six hours.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So I don't know. We'll see how this goes. We'll see how this episode goes and the episode's going forward.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Just yesterday's episode I said, "Oh man, this time jump. I lost an hour. I'm such a boomer. I'm tired."

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I actually think I'm getting sick. I think that's why. I am a boomer, but I also think that I'm getting sick

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 because of the somethings going on, because now I'm really, really tired.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 But I'm going to put all the energy I have for today into this next half hour episode.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 For you guys, for my friends. And first off, I want to say thank you.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We're getting a ton of these guys lately. It's so awesome.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I want to say thank you to my latest Patreon, Harry Lawrence.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 So thank you, Harry, so much for your support. Really, really means a lot.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon and there's a lot of reasons why people don't support Patreons,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I totally understand. You can support the show just by help getting the word out.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Because that helps a lot too, just by telling your friends, "Hey, listen, this podcast is called Dead Red Radio."

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And just kind of like, "You should make up a song about how great the podcast is."

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And then "Performant for Strangers." All of that stuff really, really helps.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 The one thing that's helped with the Patreon support specifically is I've been able to start to buy things for the podcast.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And we'll get into that in a second. But before we get into that, we're going to give Harry the keys to the carboner copter.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We are going to take this baby up, up and away. We are headed out to Hubbard, Oregon.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Actually, we don't need the carboner copter land to bring it down.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 He's like all disappointed. I'm giving you the key here. You can have a key to the carboner copter.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 You can fly it on your own time. Drive us in the Jason Jalop because it's not that far away.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We're headed to Hubbard, Oregon. It's 4 a.m. in the morning.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So we're being particularly loud as we're driving through the neighborhood honking the horn,

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 playing your custom Dead Rabbit theme song as loud as possible. It's July 14th, 1989.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Now, there's this dude named Bert Twiggs. That's not a fake name. It's not "Bert Twiggs" either.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 "Bert Twiggs" is his name. And he's sleeping in bed.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 He actually, the reason why I picked this story today is because I'm going through the same thing.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 He's sick. This guy, the Musen X-Man is totally like moved in with him. He's his roommate.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He's super sick. And he has a stomach ache, difficulty breathing. I don't have that.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I'm just really tired with the runny nose. I'm not as bad off as Bert here.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But he's laying in bed and his wife's in bed with him. It's 4 in the morning.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Uh, uh, he's totally like kind of, he's kind of whining, right?

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 He's kind of being a bit of a big baby. I mean, I've had stomach aches before and I've had difficulty breathing before

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 and I'm not in a book. But I guess the difference is, is that I simply got over it.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 This guy is a little bit different. He's laying in bed with his wife totally being a big old baby.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Oh, my tummy. I guess, again, difficulty breathing.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Maybe you're not being a big baby when you complain about that. Someone's all, "Ugh!"

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Oh, grow up. As they're trying to sleep though, they start to see weird lights in their bedroom.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 [makes weird noises]

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 All these flashing lights and stuff like that. And then, they don't really think anything of it.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 They wake up just at their normal time. They're going about their day and then they both go,

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "Wait a second. You remember those weird lights last night?"

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Yeah, yeah, I do. I do remember that. And all of a sudden, I have a memory of an alien standing at a foot of my bed

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and Bert's like, "Yeah, me too, dude. I'm totally like, I'm totally imagining that thing you just imagined."

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 What are the coincidences? So anyways, you can tell where I'm leaning at on this story.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Then, Bert, whoa! He totally, his memory gets repaired, right? Because, you know,

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 because that's just the way these stories work. His memory gets repaired.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 He remembers the aliens standing, gray aliens, basic guys, standing around his bed.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And they're like, "We noticed that you're sick. And so, this is actually a life-threatening illness.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You will die if you're not treated. So, we will heal you. Don't go to a medical professional.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Let us touch you while you're sleeping. We will heal you, Bert."

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 [Burt's mouth noises]

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So then, the aliens gave him an injection into his arm and they left.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And then we have this great quote to some of this stuff up.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 "So remember, he's sick with a stomach ache and difficulty breathing."

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Now, this story is being told from Bert to Preston Dennett.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 He wrote a book called UFO Healing. So, it's all stories about people being healed by UFOs.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And if this is one of the stories, well, then, I think I'm gonna skip this book.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Here's a quote from the story. "The next morning, his cold was noticeably improved,

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 and within 48 hours, it was completely gone."

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So, let me ask you this. Isn't that how most colds work?

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Basically, right? Like, you're sick, and then you get better, and then it's gone.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But apparently, this story was included in this book of aliens healing people.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So you go, "Well, that's weird, 'cause if I was, like, on the verge of death."

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And there are stories like this. People are on the verge of death, and, like, an alien shows up,

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 or an angel shows up, interacts with them in some way, and then their cancer's gone,

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 or they can walk, and so like that. They're not super common,

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 'cause otherwise, there would be no need for doctors, but you'll see them out there.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And you know, your mileage may vary on whether or not you believe them.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 This story is not included. This story's ridiculous, right?

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I was feeling sick. There were some aliens walking around my bedroom.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 I got better the next day, and then a couple days later, I was fine.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That's the normal course of a sickness. I mean, disregarding the alien stuff.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So why is this... One, why am I even bothering covering this story?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Two, why is it in this book? This is why I'm covering this story,

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 'cause this is going to lead us into a bunch of different stuff.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 First off, no, no, no, no, let me tell you this first, then we'll go into this final question.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Bert Twiggs is actually a very famous UFO abductee.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 If you follow me on Twitter @deadrabbitradium, a while back, I posted the cover of a book I recently purchased using Patreon money.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So again, Patreon really helps out, 'cause I can buy books and stuff like this.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Garbage nonsense. I can use your hard earned money to buy the book Secret Vowels.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And it's written by Bert Twiggs and his wife, and the cover is like a crown.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I can't say that word. It's a colored pencil. It's a drawing of him and his wife,

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 him with his big old 70s porno stash and his wife, and their family of alien hybrids.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So I'm looking up Bert Twiggs because this story was stupid and I want to find out more about him.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I find out he's an author of a book called Secret Vowels, and then I immediately look at the reviews, right?

97
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And I immediately look at the one-star reviews, because that's really the most entertaining stuff, right?

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I had to buy this book immediately after reading this review, and I will let you guys know how it is, but...

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I just love the fact that these rabbit holes, like yes, a guy has a sniffle, he has difficulty breathing,

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 but again, he could have just had a bad cough.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 That led us into this review written by Mr. Daniel Ziegler regarding the book Secret Vowels.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And you can book-- If you can't wait for me to review this book, feel free to buy a copy.

103
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's kind of rare, actually, but here's the review.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 This is the story of a technologically advanced alien race of Christians.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Mmm, that's interesting.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Alien race of Christians who have Jesus living on their ship, eat sandwiches,

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 sew their own clothes, go to shopping malls, and--

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So all that stuff's fair. You're like, "Oh, that's normal."

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I mean, maybe not Jesus living on your spaceship.

110
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But humans eat sandwiches, humans sew their own clothes, right?

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 If they're like, a bunch of like, weird religious sect, which these guys would be, because Jesus is living on--

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Would you want to live on a spaceship with Jesus? Don't get me wrong, I love Jesus, but--

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 At a certain point, I would like-- If I was sitting and all day long was just watching TV,

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 and Jesus walked in the room, I'd be like, "Oh, it's hot, so--"

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Dude, right before he came in, I was being super pious, and he's like, "Mhmm, sure you were."

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Like, I would feel a lot of pressure if I lived with Jesus, which technically, as a Christian, Jesus lives inside of me,

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 but it's a little bit different, because he's like, "In me, I don't have to worry about him."

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Like, you know, I'm out just like, lounging, and he's just like walking down the street, and I'm like, "Oh, hey Jesus, hey, how's it going, man?"

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I was totally just going to read the Bible again, he's like, "Mhmm."

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I actually think it'd be pretty cool, dude, but anyways, they're living with Jesus on their ship,

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 sounds totally, quote-unquote, "normal," right? But then we get to this.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 They go to shopping malls and engage in multiple partner marriages.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So, they're banging each other. Everyone's just-- This is a big swinger society, which would be even more embarrassing if Jesus is on your ship.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And so, I mean, come on, how do you not want to read that book about a bunch of swingers who are banging aliens,

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and Jesus is just kind of hanging out in the background, and he's like, "Ugh, why did I get trapped on this ship?"

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I wonder if Jesus sows his own clothes. But anyways, the point is, I wonder who made Jesus' clothes,

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 because obviously, like, somebody did, right? Like, someone like a tailor made his big old robes and stuff like that.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I wonder who that guy was. It doesn't matter. I guess that's kind of inconsequential to the idea of Jesus flying around a space alien.

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But you figured out we could marketing gimmick. Like, back then, like, you would be like,

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 "I was the dude who made Jesus' clothes." You would be like, "That guy was brutally murdered by the Roman government?"

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's kind of horrible to turn that into an advertising slogan. "Hey, what are you going to do? I got to make my money.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So, I got to make my ducats or whatever they spent back then."

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Anyways, the point is, all that's funny-- Here's my question to you. Can aliens heal people?

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Which, again, we've run into stories like that before. I've never been in a situation where I've had someone super close to me

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 get an illness and slowly die from it. I've lost people very, very quickly. I've gotten those phone calls at two in the morning.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I've had that happen. I've had people who've gotten sick and died like that. But I've never had that long-term sickness

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 that I can recall right off the bat. And so, I don't know how that would be. Like, I know now this is getting depressing.

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 You're like, "No, Jason, just talking about Jesus on the space alien again."

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 But to round out the story, like, that would suck to be like losing someone slowly. And you would be like praying for a miracle.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And if that miracle came in the guise of a bunch of great aliens, then so be it, right?

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But I think those type of stories hold out hope that something can happen when someone's dying slowly that maybe a miracle is on the way.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I think there are important stories in that sense. And almost mythological, we have that thing where first it's the gods,

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 the old gods who can do miracles, and then you have the saints who can do miracles, or the angels that can do miracles.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And as society advances, quote, unquote, advances and starts to disregard the old ways, they still want to believe,

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 they still want to have the comfort of miracles. So now it's just aliens doing that same thing.

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Or the simulation correcting glitches, or whatever the next stage of this will be.

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 People always want to believe in miracles, even if they don't want to believe in the source of the miracle itself.

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story. And actually I didn't think about it, but that's a really good segue,

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 because our next story also involves a miracle. So now, Harry, now fire up that carbon helicopter, there's no way we're driving to the Philippines.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 We're headed off to Manila. Is it the Philippines? It's not Manila Philippines. It's Manila the Philippines.

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I'm actually a people who listen to the show for a long time. I'm what's called a fill head. I know so much about the Philippines,

152
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 except for that one detail, I'm probably the 11th smartest person in the world when it comes to Philippines trivia.

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So we're flying out to the Philippines. I know exactly where it's at. It's right... go a little bit further, Harry, keep pilot.

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 There we are. There we are. Right there. Land. We're landing on an archipelago. Archipelago? Can't pronounce that word either,

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 but we're landing on a series of islands in the sea, right, off the coast of Asia.

156
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And you know what's funny is when I was researching this story, it brought back a bunch of memories,

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 because I know I always talk about my age, which I think is important because I think it puts a lot of stuff in context,

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and stories like this too. When I was a kid, the saga of the Marcos, the Marcos family in the Philippines,

159
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 dominated the headlines. I remember being... this story takes place in 1986, so I would have been 10 years old,

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and I remember not the exact details of the story, but I remember like there'd be Saturday Night Live skits about how corrupt that family was.

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Like, I'm trying to think of a corollary to this age, but it was a government across the world from the United States,

162
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 but it became so famous for their lavish corruption and brutality, which I don't really remember that level of it,

163
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 but I remember all the stuff, basically the Marcos family going off in memory, because I didn't do a bunch of research on that,

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 but basically it was your standard corrupt government. It was Saddam Hussein without the outright brutality,

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 but going through this story, people were... that's what I remember. Going through this story, people were saying that there was a level of brutality in the Marcos regime as well,

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 but super famous, so revisiting this story brought back memories of like watching the nightly news of my dad and all this stuff going on.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 It was an interesting period. All that being said, we're going to the Philippines now, and what happens there is the Marcos family had been in power for 20 years,

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 and to the point that one of his political rivals was assassinated, and that politician's wife, Widow, at this point, decided to run for president,

169
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 which is a pretty ballsy move. Someone kills your husband and you're like, "I'll try that. I'll try to take that guy down."

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Her name was Cori Aquino. She runs, and basically she wins, but the Marcos government says, "No, she didn't. We'll count those votes."

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 "Oh, no, no, no. She didn't win." So people are really upset. They see a lot of fraud. They see a lot of brutality. They see a lot of corruption.

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And a bunch of political rivals start getting arrested, rivals of the Marcos. So Cori Aquino and a couple others go to the city, try to figure out their next move.

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And everyone knows the next move is basically them getting arrested en masse by Ferdinand Marcos and his military.

174
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 There's a cardinal, there's a Catholic cardinal named Cardinal Vidal, and he gets on the radio and he goes, "Guys, the election was a total fraud,

175
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and we need to protect these leaders. We need to go out and protect these leaders, because we know what's going to happen.

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 If the military gets to them first, they're just going to disappear into prisons." Hundreds of thousands of people begin pouring out of their house and traveling to this city,

177
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 because everyone knew where they were at. It was just a logistical issue of getting their military surrounding them. People started pouring out of their houses, driving out to this place.

178
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And there's another cardinal, Cardinal Sin, which is kind of ironic. Cardinal Sin is like, "Go out there and don't just go out there.

179
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Bring them food, bring them supplies, and show them love. Just hang out with them." And it was basically a massive party.

180
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Started off a couple hundred thousand people, peaked at over a million people. Whole families were there.

181
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And at the core of this group was political rivals, people that Marcos had to stamp out. So he's like, "Well, get the tanks, get the helicopters. We're going to do this."

182
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The tanks go into the area and there's just masses of people before you could even hope to get to their target.

183
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And the tanks stop. This is where history kind of splits. Some people say the tanks had orders to open fire on the people or to run them over if need be.

184
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Other people say, "No, no, no, Marcos never wanted to hurt the people. He just wanted to intimidate the people." So there's that division.

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 The general consensus is that those people were going to get ran over. But the pro-Marcos people are like, "No, no, no, he just wanted to scare them."

186
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But he was also flying attack helicopters around. It's kind of hard to scare someone with something that's just flying around you. So that's a little weird.

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, the tanks show up and the people not only won't move, nuns are climbing on top of the tanks and sitting there, just hanging out.

188
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And everyone's like, "It's super tense. You have the military that is ready to crush all resistance."

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Because they know this is the end. Marcos knows that if he does not stop this, this is the end of his reign.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 He can't let a million people protect his political rivals. This will be the end.

191
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The nuns are sitting on the tanks. The tanks are getting ready to go in. And that's when this political story becomes a dead rabbit radio story.

192
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Across appears in the sky.

193
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Across a pure light. And everyone sees it. The tank commander see it. The people on the ground see it. Political opposition see it.

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But that doesn't stop the tank commanders from getting ready to move on this crowd.

195
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 They've been sitting here long enough. They're getting orders to put down this insurrection. It's time to go.

196
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So despite the fact of this light cross in the sky, this cross made of energy in the sky.

197
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 In a deeply Catholic country, I mean, I wouldn't do much in Britain, right? They'd be like, "Oh, cheerio. I'm atheist. Not too worried about that.

198
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I'm not worried about my business just crushing people's heads open."

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But in a deeply Catholic country, that's going to be an omen.

200
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But it's not enough to stop the tanks from getting ready to go in.

201
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But then you have the ace in the hole, the Virgin Mary appears before the tank commanders.

202
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And not only does this vision of Jesus' mom show up, not only does this vision that if you had to come up with an icon for the Catholic religion, she's what, the second, the third one up there besides the cross in Jesus himself,

203
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and got Virgin Mary standing in front of these tank commanders. Not only is this vision of the Virgin Mary standing there, she talks.

204
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 "Dear soldiers," she says, "Stop. Do not proceed. Do not harm my children. I am the queen of this land."

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I talked earlier about the split between whether or not Marcos was going to really murder these people or just wanted to intimidate them.

206
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 There's an interesting thing here because there's two versions of this story, but I think there's proof that one of them is actually more true than the other.

207
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 When I was researching this, I'm on Wikipedia and they're talking about the military showed up to stop the protesters, and then they just said, "No, we're going to be on the protesters,"

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 and they basically turned their tank battalions over to the opposition. That's what Wikipedia says.

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Wikipedia also has this great anecdote where Marcos orders this helicopter attack wing that I mentioned earlier to fly over to the pro--

210
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 so the tanks have now turned, the helicopter wing goes over there, they land, and they all get out and join the protesters.

211
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 So no matter what Marcos was sending over there, they were just quitting his side and joining the revolution.

212
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 He eventually got thrown out of the country and all that stuff. But that's neither here nor there.

213
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So we have this moment. We do know that the tank brigade joined the protesters.

214
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But the Wikipedia page doesn't mention the vision of Mary at all.

215
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 We're looking at a website called DivineMysteries.com for this one.

216
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And hold on, I know that's not the most reputable website, but to be fair, neither is Wikipedia.

217
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And two, again, there's more information coming. DivineMysteries.com has this phrase after the Virgin Mary appeared, "Then the soldiers dropped their weapons, withdrew from pressing forward,

218
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 and joined the throngs of people to turn and fight with them against the Marcos regime."

219
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And the reason why I think that this story is true in the sense that the Virgin Mary did appear is that at this location now,

220
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 there is a massive statue of the Virgin Mary.

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 The fact that I think this-- and it should be in the Wikipedia, because I think that's an interesting element.

222
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 It's not that the troops just showed up and said, "Ah, you know, it's Wednesday, I'm going to join you."

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 You had a religious icon appear to people who followed that religion and turned them around.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I mean, and that changed the course of the battle.

225
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Whether or not you personally believe it, you probably should put it in there as part of the historical turning point,

226
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 because now there is a statue of this vision at this location.

227
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 She's known as Our Lady of Esta.

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And people who were there remember that event.

229
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They remember seeing the Virgin Mary stand between them and the tanks, the tank commanders remember it, and so on and so forth.

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And so they've erected this statue because of that.

231
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 They actually had-- so there's this-- I don't want to get into it.

232
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 It's such a long story, but it's fairly well known, probably one of the most well-known Catholic stories,

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 you know, outside of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

234
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 The vision of Fatima? Fatima?

235
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I think it's Fatima.

236
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 It's well known. I just mean I can pronounce it.

237
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 These three girls saw a vision of the Virgin Mary when they were out, like, hurting sheep or drinking water or something like that.

238
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And it gave them three prophecies, and then two came true, and then the third one was to never be revealed.

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Apparently, the third one was the prophecy of involving either the death of a pope or the fall of a pope.

240
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 But that story's super well known.

241
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Anyways, the last surviving girl of the Fatima prophecy

242
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 visited this area because, you know, Virgin Mary's being spotted.

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Again, it's interactive with people. She visited this area, and she said that if Corioquino did everything--

244
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Corioquino was appointed by God to rule the country of the Philippines at this time,

245
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 and that's why Mary showed up at this time to intervene.

246
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Had-- if she does everything that God wants her to, she will bring Christianity to China within 10 years,

247
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and China will fall, as a communist country and become a Christian.

248
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 That obviously didn't happen.

249
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 So I don't know if just the prophecy wasn't real, or she was just kind of making it up,

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 or Cori didn't do everything she needed to do, or who knows.

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 What we do know is that Marcos was overthrown.

252
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 People did see this-- people-- a lot of people saw this vision of the Virgin Mary,

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 and that China is still a brutal and corrupt government.

254
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 This is an interesting story, because there's two ways to look at it.

255
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 One, you could look at it as-- it could be-- when I keep saying that it happened--

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I'm not specifically saying that it actually happened, because we can't put on a skeptical hat--

257
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 it could be that it was mass panic, right, in a moment where everyone thinks they're going to die,

258
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and the tank commanders are about to kill their own people.

259
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It takes extra-- it takes an extra brutal regime to kill their own.

260
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Like, murder and war is already bad enough, but to kill your own, you got to be just absolutely brutal,

261
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 but it could be a mass hysteria.

262
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The Virgin Mary could not have been there, it could have been a mass hysteria,

263
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 but people thought they saw it, and people's memories got changed,

264
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 because everyone was talking about seeing it, and so on and so forth,

265
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 because really for a sizable amount of people to see her, she would have been pretty tall, right?

266
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Like, if she was the size of-- if she was like an average woman, if she was like 5'4", 5'5",

267
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 you're not going to see her more than two or three rows back.

268
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So, it could be mass panic, people being misremembering, but they still have the statue there.

269
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 It still was a turning point in the war, but it didn't actually happen.

270
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's one theory.

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Theory two is that it actually was the Virgin Mary.

272
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Philippines is, like I've said before, deeply Catholic country,

273
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 so it would make sense that if this country was on the verge of mass slaughter,

274
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and maybe Corio Aquino was supposed to play some role in God's plan,

275
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 if you follow that theology, God would send down messengers to intervene and stuff like that.

276
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 That's kind of his MO.

277
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He's been doing it for, you know, tens of thousands of years.

278
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 That would make sense that it actually was the Virgin Mary who was like,

279
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 "Oh, things have gotten too-- I gotta go down and talk to my kids, stop soldiers," stuff like that.

280
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 There's a third scenario, though.

281
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Third scenario, and we're going to end it like this.

282
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Project Bluebeam.

283
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Now, I did a whole episode on it a long time ago, and it's a really good episode.

284
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I recommend listening to it, but briefly,

285
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and Project Bluebeam is, for the most part,

286
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 been dismissed as just a weird man's rant,

287
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 but I think the technology itself is fascinating.

288
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Project Bluebeam is basically the ability for the US government or a secret society,

289
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 whichever boogeyman you pick,

290
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 to create a 3D hologram of a religious icon

291
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 that can talk and can interact with people,

292
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 and can control groups of people.

293
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You could project it over the Middle East with the voice of Allah.

294
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You could use it in the United States with Jesus walking down, you know, Main Street, stuff like that.

295
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And it would be a way to get people to--

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 One, in a battle, it would be a way to get people's attention like that.

297
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 If you had a bunch of troops amassing in an area and there's a bright flash in the sky,

298
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 and you hear a deep, booming voice,

299
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 at the very least, you're going to get a tactical advantage.

300
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 People are going to be like, "What in the world was that?"

301
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And if it's saying stuff like, "Put down your weapons,"

302
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 you know, it is the will of Allah, or Jesus is like,

303
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 "Buy these shorts, two for one off, stand outside of them, Macy."

304
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It's like, there's a lot of different ways.

305
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It would at least get your attention.

306
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And then some people might actually sway.

307
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 This would be an intro.

308
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It's early enough in the timeline,

309
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 the Bluebeam technology really started to come out,

310
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 like the theory behind it started to come out in the late 70s, early 80s.

311
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So we're early enough in that timeline where they would have been fiddling with it.

312
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But it would be interesting if you had someone with that technology

313
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 and you're watching this about to play out,

314
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 and you go, "Let's see what this can do in a real-life application."

315
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 We've been projecting Jesus floating around the laboratory all day long.

316
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 We've been bugging our coworkers.

317
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But let's see what we can do with this in a real-life situation.

318
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 So they program in Virgin Mary,

319
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and they make her appear and give her a message to deliver,

320
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and people fall for it.

321
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And I think that's an interesting take on it,

322
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 because the reason why I kind of go with that is one,

323
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 tons of people saw it.

324
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So it had to be tall.

325
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 It wasn't just like if Virgin Mary appeared in front of you,

326
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 would she be life-size?

327
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Or would she be giant?

328
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So everyone can see her.

329
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 If she's giant, that makes me lean more towards some sort of holographic technology.

330
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But what really makes me suspicious to the fact that,

331
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 again, assuming that any of this happened,

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 we do know they have this statue of it,

333
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 so something happened there, but it could be a mess, panic.

334
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But assuming they actually saw these things,

335
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 what makes me think it's different than simply the Virgin Mary herself showing up,

336
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 is the cross appearing at first, the glowing cross in the sky.

337
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And that almost seems like someone projected that image first,

338
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 and it didn't stop the tanks from coming in.

339
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So then they're like, "Oh, Plan B, doop!"

340
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And the Virgin Mary appears.

341
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Who knows? Who knows?

342
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So this story may have a psychological component,

343
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 people on the edge of terror and mass panic,

344
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 and all imagining something or throughout time,

345
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 the story modifying.

346
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It could be a tulpa.

347
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Everyone terrified that somebody on the other side will give,

348
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and they create this vision amongst themselves,

349
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 just out of the fear and confusion and everything going on.

350
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 So you have psychological component to it.

351
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 You have the religious component to it.

352
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 It could have actually been the Virgin Mary coming down

353
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 and knowing that millions of people were going to be slaughtered.

354
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 This was going to be a bloodbath,

355
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 because if the tanks had moved in,

356
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and then the helicopters probably wouldn't have landed,

357
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 they probably would have attacked and stuff like that,

358
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 because once you start the brutality, it's very hard to pull back.

359
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 It's like mob rule.

360
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 It's like when people start rioting,

361
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 people are flipping over cars,

362
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 there's not someone to be like,

363
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "Don't do that, guys! You're flipping over cars too.

364
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 You just can't stop it."

365
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 So how do these tanks rolled in?

366
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It would have been a bloodbath.

367
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So you could have that religious component,

368
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 or you could have the sci-fi component,

369
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 where it wasn't a mystical experience.

370
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 It was a man in a laboratory hitting buttons,

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 speaking into a microphone,

372
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 being like, "Dear soldiers, stop.

373
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Little voice changer."

374
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And what the weird thing is, is all of them are equally bizarre.

375
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 All of those possible scenarios are equally bizarre.

376
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 What we do know, other than pro-Marco's propaganda,

377
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 what we do know is, a slaughter was averted that day.

378
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Was it averted by mass panic,

379
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 and people imagining that their savior was there?

380
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Was it averted because someone wanted to test out some new equipment?

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 When time was tight and everything was on the line,

382
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 they wanted to see if their device could actually fool people

383
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 into believing that a religious icon was in front of them.

384
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Or was it stopped by God?

385
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Was it stopped by God and the Virgin Mary,

386
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 and millions of lives saved, and a corrupt government overthrown?

387
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 The planet Earth is just like the human body.

388
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And when it gets sick, we pray for a miracle.

389
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 When we look around the world and see horrible things going on

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 that seem outside of our control,

391
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 we hope someone from the outside, be it God or aliens,

392
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 comes in and helps us out.

393
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 We'd like to get to a point where we could cure ourselves,

394
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 where we could fix these problems before they end up with millions dead.

395
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But until humanity advances to that point,

396
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 you can either hope or pray that someone shows up

397
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 and saves us from ourselves.

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
