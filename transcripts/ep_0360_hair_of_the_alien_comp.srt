1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Bigfoot was spotted off the Hood River freeway.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Well, yes, we're finally getting to that story after three days.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Many starts and stops.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 And then we look at probably one of my newest favorite alien stories that I've come across.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:24,500
 What happens when a man wakes up surrounded by beautiful, naked alien women?

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,500
 The answer may surprise you today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 Hope you guys had a great week.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 So let's go ahead and jump right into this.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 First off, Hood River, Oregon.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 I've been talking about this for days now.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
 I've been saying, oh yeah, we're going to do the story.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
 Bigfoot spotted in Hood River.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 I've been talking about this for a couple of miles from where I live.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 But first let's do, and then I would talk about some other random topic.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 Or he was going to be in the Kevin Spacey episode, but I just could not.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 That Kevin Spacey episode ended up just being all about him, which is rare really for the show.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 Usually I do at least two stories in episode, but that Kevin Spacey thing was just so bizarre.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 The whole thing was weird.

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 So bizarre that Bigfoot himself was like, "Me wait. Me curious too about all deaths associated with him."

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 He's reading a magazine.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 We're going to get to it right now though.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 So Veronica, friend of the show Veronica, emails me the other day.

28
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 Text messages me.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 I forgot to be specific.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
 Bigfoot was spotted in Hood River.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 I was like, "What?"

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 And she was like, "Type typing.

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 I don't know what her expression was on the other end."

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,500
 But she sent me a link, which was a link to an app, to a news app, that I had to download just to read the story.

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 Very, very suspicious.

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 So I downloaded the app.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
 And I know a thrilling narrative here.

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 They're like, "Did he download the app?"

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 I downloaded the app.

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 When the story first came out, it was only available on the app, on this weird local news app.

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 And then it started to filter out into the wider web.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 And I found a couple links that you can actually go to without downloading some Russian app onto your phone.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 Right now there's a bunch of guys on their way to cut my fingers off on some internet red room camera, because I downloaded the app.

44
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
 But before that happens, let's talk about this.

45
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 November 30th, 2019.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 Oh, and thanks Veronica for sending the story.

47
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 November 30th, 2019.

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 There's this dude driving down I-84 at night.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 And he sees something big standing on the side of the road.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 Just standing there.

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 Medicinely tall.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
 Shrouded in darkness.

53
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 Oooh, that's a zombie.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 That's a zombie noise.

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 He didn't hear any noise.

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 He was listening to NPR or something that people in Oregon listen to.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 He couldn't hear what it was saying, but he saw a giant monster standing on the side of the road.

58
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 You don't really need to hear what they're saying.

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 They're making monster noises.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 He calls up the Oregon State Police and he says, "I saw a bigfoot."

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 The dispatch goes through and of course they were like, "Is it a bear?"

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 And he's like, "No, it's bigger than a bear. Way bigger than a bear."

63
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 It was like dwarfing the guardrail.

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 And the dispatcher who gets the call goes, "You know what?

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 There's an ODOT camera there."

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 I can actually verify this.

67
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 Turns to their little computer all nerdy, like typing in coordinates to satellite view.

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 Doot, doot, doot.

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 Zoom in, zoom in, and seize the ODOT camera.

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 Which I guess I should tell you guys for people who want to hear like, "What the hell's an ODOT camera?"

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 Oregon Department of Transportation.

72
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 They're the cameras on the side of the freeway.

73
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 They pull it up.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 Nighttime photo of the time when the guy saw the thing reported in the Bigfoot.

75
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 There is a giant shape standing on the side of the road.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 Gentlemen, we caught him.

77
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 Photo of Bigfoot in Hood River.

78
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 Now, like I said, this was originally on the Russian spy app.

79
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 And then I found it actually on the surface web and I put some links in the show notes below.

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 You can check out the photo yourself.

81
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 And I wanted to do this story and I put it off because Kevin Spacey became a big old weirdo.

82
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 And then I said, "You know what? I'm checking out a little bit more."

83
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 And somebody, I don't know why I didn't think of this.

84
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 Somebody on Facebook, no one, I'll just give her first name so I don't want to be accused of doxing her.

85
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 Shelby, Facebook user Shelby.

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 The photo though is on the show notes.

87
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 She goes, "Wait, this is interesting. Let's see what this looks like during the daytime."

88
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 So in the mid-December is when the story started to break and it wasn't until a couple weeks later,

89
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 someone goes, "Wait a second, if there's an ODOT camera there, we can easily see that same position during the day."

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 When the sun's up.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 It's a giant, it's a big old bush.

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 It's a big old bush.

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 [breathing]

94
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 Now, when I look at the nighttime photo, you do realize that it most likely is a giant tree.

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 A giant tree or bush with shoulders?

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 Yes. Has a roundish head? Yes.

97
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 Big old body, it's tall. It's just a bush.

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 Now, what's funny about this story is that I assumed, and this is the problem with a lot of people who follow this stuff,

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 i.e. me, I assumed that people who knew the area would come out immediately and go,

100
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,500
 "I've been by there 100 times, it's just a big old bush. It's not a big bush."

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
 So I was assuming that the due diligence was done.

102
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 And you're thinking, "Jason, isn't this like five miles from where you live? Couldn't you have gone out there?"

103
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 I was planning on it. I wanted to get a crew and go out along the freeway and try to find big foot tracks,

104
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,500
 and it's just a big old bush. So I'm glad that I discovered it was a bush now.

105
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 So that is the story of the Hood River Bigfoot. You're like, "Jason, you really put that off for three days?"

106
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Well, it's good that I did. It's good that I did, because again, if I had announced it earlier,

107
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 I would have said Bigfoot was in Hood River, and that's simply not the case.

108
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story, though.

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Our next story, like I said in the intro, might be one of my favorite new stories.

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 So let's hop on board the carpenter copter. We're going to leave behind Hood River.

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 You see me as I'm flying over the interstage, single-tier, dropping off my face.

112
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 Every time I see a bush, I'm like, "No. Is the... No."

113
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 And you're like, "Jason, quit flying over hedge mazes." I was like, "Ah, he's everywhere. Bigfoot is invading Hood River."

114
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 We're flying away. We're leaving Hood River. We're going to Australia, the land down under.

115
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 And in Australia, we're going to meet Peter Corey and his wife Vivian.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 The year is 1988. It's February.

117
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 Now, we're not going to be around for a lot of this stuff.

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 We're going to have to put on our cloaking caps that I just invented, our cloaking cloaks,

119
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 because there's going to be some weird stuff going on.

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 We don't want to interfere with the order of things.

121
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 So I'm standing there. You're standing there. We're both invisible.

122
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 Peter's hanging out with his wife, and you're like, "Jason, how weird is this story going to get?

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 It's going to get weird. That's why we're invisible."

124
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 They see, off in the distance, lights in the sky.

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 [Light in the sky]

126
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 They see some lights in the sky. It's February 1988. Big deal. Everyone sees UFOs. Lights in the sky is not a big thing.

127
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,500
 July 12, 1988.

128
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 [Heavy breathing]

129
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 Peter wakes up in the middle of the night.

130
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 And you're like, "Jason, why were we watching? Why were we cloaked in a dark room watching him sleep for the past two hours?"

131
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 Until he woke up, and I go, "Well, first off, I have fetish for this, but secondly, because of this."

132
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 And that is when we see three or four, there's difference on the accounts, but we'll just say three.

133
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 Three little dudes show up on the side of the bed.

134
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 Little people, and you're like, "Okay, now it's getting freaky."

135
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 These three little guys, they're wearing cloaks. They're walking along the side of his bed in the dark.

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 Moonlight cutting through the curtain. He's paralyzed.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 What are these dwarves doing in my house? Why are they wearing cloaks?

138
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 Why do I hear the sound of a man enjoying his fetish?

139
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 Yeah, there's nothing there. It's completely invisible in the corner of the room.

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 The creatures move closer and closer to Peter.

141
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 And then one of them tells him telepathically, tells Peter, "Don't be afraid. It'll just be like last time."

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 And before Peter can really comprehend what that means, the hooded figure pulls out a giant needle and inserts it into Peter's brain.

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 [Sizzling]

144
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 Peter passes out. Obviously, obviously, most people I think would.

145
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 Peter wakes up. Time later, he runs. Then the story gets weird.

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 That part's weird. But then that part's weird.

147
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 But then he jumps up out of bed. He wakes up a couple minutes later or something like that.

148
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 And he jumps out of bed and his brother's sleeping in the living room.

149
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 And he's like, "Whoa, dude, you won't believe what just happened."

150
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 There's this weird interchange that goes on that I just kind of dismissed out of hand.

151
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 One, why is the brother in the other room? You're like, "Jason, brother's asleep in other rooms. Midsuits don't poke you in the brain."

152
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 You're getting hung up on the wrong part of the story to debunk it.

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
 But I thought it was weird. He jumps up.

154
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 The first thing I would do, okay, if I was sleeping in bed and a bunch of little people showed up around my apartment

155
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 and started sticking stuff in my brain, and then I woke up, okay?

156
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 I would immediately go, "That was a horrible dream."

157
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 But let's say that I thought it was totally real. I wouldn't jump out of bed and leave my wife there

158
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 to go tell my brother that somebody just stabbed me in the head.

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
 Who knows if they're gonna come back and start stabbing her in the head?

160
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 But anyways, he jumps up. There was some lost time.

161
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 He's like, "Oh, man, you won't believe that."

162
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 And the wife ends up checking his head and he has a little puncture wound in his brain.

163
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 Now, okay, okay, so let's examine everything. This isn't the weird part of the story either.

164
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 And the brother sleeping in the next room is not the weird part either.

165
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 But let's take a look at this. He wakes up. He gets stabbed in the brain.

166
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 There's been a lot of stories of people going like, "Oh, yeah, I got shot with a beam of light."

167
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 And then when I woke up, I had a hard implant in my arm.

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 And I went to the doctor. They were never able to identify it.

169
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 Very rarely is their brain penetrated with a piece of steel.

170
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 There is physical evidence of it the next day.

171
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 She looks, she sees like a little bloody mark on his head.

172
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 And he doesn't immediately go to the ER and say,

173
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 "This is gonna sound crazy, but three dwarves stabbed me in the brain last night."

174
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 Like, where's the medical records of that?

175
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 Because if I had a dream that somebody shot a beam of light on my arm,

176
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 I wouldn't even think twice about going to the hospital.

177
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 If I woke up and there was a little lump under my arm, I'd probably deal with it for a couple days.

178
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 But the next time I was at the doctor, I'd probably mention it being like,

179
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 "Hey, you know, before I go, just wanna let you know, I think extra terrestrial's put this in my arm."

180
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 But if I got stabbed in the head and my wife could verify it looked like I got stabbed in the head,

181
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 you would go to the hospital that day, right?

182
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 Like, I'm not, that is a little ridiculous that as far as any of the narratives I read,

183
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 he just went about it, he went about his day.

184
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
 But again, that's not, we're not even close to the weird part yet.

185
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
 I should say now, I don't know if I said this in the intro,

186
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 but I wanna tell you now, this story is supposedly true.

187
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 It was a very well-documented UFO alien encounter back in the 80s, early 90s,

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 and it is detailed in a book called "The Hair of the Alien."

189
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 So I want you to keep waiting for the hair to show up, 'cause it does show up.

190
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 July 23rd, 1992. We're jumping to that year.

191
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 And this, like I said, this is detailed in the book "The Hair of the Alien."

192
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 Now, I have not read the book, I read articles about the book.

193
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 I read reviews about the book, and there is one, only one, one-star review about the book.

194
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 From somebody named "Paranoid Reviews," which I'm thinking they're probably into this type of stuff,

195
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 but they didn't, they were debunking the book in the review.

196
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 And they revealed some information about the beginning of the story,

197
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 and I will reveal that now as well, because it's very important.

198
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 But as I'm reading the articles about this, July 23rd, 1992,

199
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 Peter is at home, he got injured at work, and he was on pain pills at the point of this story.

200
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 Now, when I read that, I go, "Oh, I don't know what's coming.

201
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 I'm just reading this article. I don't know where this article is going to end up."

202
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 But when it says he's at home with a work injury, and he was on pain pills,

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
 I thought immediately, "Oh, this could be some sort of hallucination."

204
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 Not like he's taking acid-induced pain pills.

205
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 But if you take too many pain pills, you can get groggy, you can start to fall asleep,

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 you can have waking dreams, stuff like that.

207
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 So when I read that he was home with a work injury, and he was taking pain pills,

208
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 I immediately started to get a little skeptical about what was going to come.

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 Paranoid Reviews, the person who gave this review on Amazon, which is linked in the show notes, says,

210
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 "The reason why, and I can't prove this, I mean, this might be alleged the guy could have been a troll, a review account."

211
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 But according to Paranoid Reviews, who read the book and showed the pages that these passages are on,

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 that's what makes me think is a little more credible, says,

213
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 "In the book it details Peter's injury."

214
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 So all the articles I read was just like, "Oh, he's at home with a work injury."

215
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:10,500
 The work injury was him, apparently, getting hit with the shovel several times in the head.

216
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 So I don't know if he's working at Acme, and Bugs Bunny showed up that day.

217
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 He's the general manager. He's like, "We gotta test out these shovels."

218
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 But apparently, he took one, if not more, shovel blows to the head.

219
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 That, I understand why they did not put that in the articles, talking about this,

220
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 because that makes you even more skeptical.

221
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 So he gets in the head with a shovel. The shovel is the perfect shape of his face.

222
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 Forman sends him home. He leaves Toontown. He goes home. He gets a prescription.

223
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,500
 He starts taking a bunch of pain pills, which apparently also Paranoid Reviews says in the book

224
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 that Peter himself says it was a lot of pain pills.

225
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 So, just setting that up. If you're a skeptic, you're gonna go, the rest of the story is completely null and void.

226
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 You have a guy who suffered comical head injuries, and he's on a bunch of pain pills.

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 Let's keep going, though. He wakes up.

228
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 Apparently, apparently he doesn't breathe when he sleeps every time he wakes up.

229
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 And we're standing there in this bedroom. We're still invisible.

230
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 And we see him wake up and sitting on the bed are two gorgeous, beautiful naked women.

231
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 One of them is a tall Asian chick, long brown hair, chiseled features.

232
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 And then on the other side of the bed sits a beautiful six foot tall blonde woman.

233
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 Long, beautiful blonde hair.

234
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 Now, Peter says he wakes up and he starts talking about how beautiful these women are, but they were too beautiful.

235
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 Imagine waking up and it's Britney Spears and, I don't know, Constance Woo sitting on your bed.

236
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 But, you're like, I don't like Britney Spears and I don't know who Constance Woo is.

237
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 Let's imagine that, whatever, it's the two hottest chicks you've ever seen.

238
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 Two hottest chicks you've ever seen. You wake up. They're totally naked, but they're too hot.

239
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,500
 They're too perfect. He said that their faces looked super chiseled.

240
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 And the implication is they're kind of alienish or hybrids or something like that, right?

241
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 So you got an Asian girl, a blonde girl sitting on your bed.

242
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 He suffered. That would be worth the brain injuries. You're like, thank you, God.

243
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 And thank you, that negligent employee with those shovels.

244
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 Got these beautiful women on my bed. His wife's at work, by the way. I guess I should say that too.

245
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 So his wife's at work, wakes up. There's two naked women on his bed.

246
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Now, I know what I would do in this circumstance, but he is scared.

247
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 He doesn't want to do anything, but the blonde reaches and grabs the back of his head.

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 Now, apparently, I think this part of the story might be made up,

249
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 not in the fact that I don't believe that a bunch of naked aliens showed up in his house,

250
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 but I'm sure this is the version he told his wife. He's like, no, I was not going to make out with these two

251
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 impossibly beautiful women. They made me. I think this first, I think he was probably like,

252
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 it's time for dinner. But his version that he tells us is that the woman grabs the back of his head

253
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 and she's like pulling his head towards her boob. And he's fighting.

254
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 No, no, not the boob, not the impossibly beautiful boob. And he's fighting it.

255
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 And he goes, she was so strong. Can you imagine him telling this story to his wife?

256
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 He does eventually tell it to his wife. And he could do it. He's like, honey, listen,

257
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 I really, really tried hard not to suck on her booby, but she made me.

258
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 She was impossibly, she had the strength of 20 alien warlords. How could I resist?

259
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 And so he's like fighting it and she's getting his head closer and closer and closer.

260
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 And then finally, I mean, I'm sure the struggle took less than a second.

261
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 I'm sure the sound barrier was broken. His head was moving so quickly towards her boob.

262
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 But in his version of the story, I put up the fight. I fought until I could fight no more.

263
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 He ends up with her boob in his mouth, nipple to be specific, not the whole boob.

264
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 He didn't distend his jaw. He's not an anaconda. So this isn't even the weird part.

265
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 Okay, we haven't even gotten to the hair yet. Not even gotten to the hair.

266
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 So now he's suckling on an alien woman's nipple.

267
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 Now I'm going to pause for a second. I'm going to take a drink of this delicious diet A&W root beer.

268
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 And I want you to guess what happens next.

269
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 Peter says he doesn't know why he did this, but he bit her nipple off.

270
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 Bites into her boob with such force that her areola and nipple slide off of her boob.

271
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 Now they're in his mouth. And he says, here's his actual quote. Here's his actual quote.

272
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 "The expression on her face was like, 'This isn't the way.' In a way it was shock or confusion."

273
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 That's saying it like, you ate a woman's nipple and to go, "Hmm, that's weird. She seems shocked and/or confused."

274
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 You're eating her. So that is normal. That doesn't mean she's an alien.

275
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 Back to the quote, "In a way it was shock or confusion. She looked at the Asian one and looked at me.

276
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 This isn't the way it's supposed to happen. You've done this wrong."

277
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 Now she doesn't actually say that apparently. That's kind of the way he's looking at her face.

278
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 So he has bit off this woman's nipple. The woman is like, "What? What's going on? That's not the way it's supposed to go."

279
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 And then he swallows it. And when he swallows the nipple, both women immediately vanish.

280
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 They could have at least stuck around and given him the Heimlich, but they don't. He begins coughing.

281
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 There's a little catch in his throat. Now those suck. I hate it when you have a catch in the throat.

282
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 It's even worse when it's a human nipple. He goes into the bathroom.

283
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 He has this nipple stuck in the back of his throat. He goes to drink water to get it to flush it out, right?

284
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 And then he's like, "Drink a water. It doesn't work. He still has a nipple in his throat."

285
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 And then he's like, "Oh man, I have to go to the bathroom. Really bad. I just drank a bunch of water."

286
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 And then his penis starts to hurt. He's like, "Ugh, ow. Ugh."

287
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 You're like, "Jason, damn it, Jason. Didn't you just do a whole episode about people getting their balls crushed so badly they died?"

288
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 Yes, I did do that episode and you guys hated it. By the way, you guys hated that episode so much.

289
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,500
 It was hilarious. How many comments were like, "Dude, seriously?"

290
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 Ha ha ha ha. So now...

291
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 I do not have a CBT finish either. I just think this story is hilarious.

292
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 This dude, he's sitting... People are just shutting the podcast off now.

293
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
 No no no no no no no. Don't shut it off. Don't shut it off.

294
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 This guy, he's sitting there. He has a nipple in his throat.

295
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 And he's like, "Ugh, penis. Ugh. It hurts. It hurts so bad."

296
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 And he's looking at it and he can't figure out why it hurts, but it's burning really, really badly.

297
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 And then he pulls back his foreskin and he notices that tightly wrapped around it are two long, thin, blonde strands of hair.

298
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 And they're wrapped so tightly that as his penis is getting engorged, which I don't know why it is at this point.

299
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 I don't know if he has a CBT thing, but as his penis is getting bigger, the strands aren't moving.

300
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 They're wrapped so tightly. He's, "Ahh! Ahh! It's burning him!"

301
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 And he has to like, "It's a deadline, man. You gotta undo these wires."

302
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 He's like, "Slowly unwrapping these yellow blonde hairs."

303
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,500
 "Ugh. Oh, there's one. Okay. Just one left. Just one left. Ahh! It's getting bigger. It's getting bigger!"

304
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 [Growling]

305
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
 [Sigh]

306
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,500
 I mean, because he still has a nipple on his throat.

307
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 Now, he unravels these two blonde hairs that were magically wrapped around his penis.

308
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 I'm sure is what he told his wife. He puts him in a baggie.

309
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 Now, you're like Jason. That's the dumbest.

310
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 That's the dumbest UFO story. This guy obviously made this stuff up. Do not.

311
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 Okay, this is where all of that stuff is weird.

312
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 But now we're gonna get into the bizarre.

313
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 So we have a guy telling a story.

314
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 I woke up. There was two naked chicks in bed with me.

315
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 I went, "Yes!" I mean, "No, no. I'm married!"

316
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,500
 And they made me suck on one of the nipples, and I panicked and bit it and swallowed it.

317
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 And the wife's like, "Oh my God. Just tell me you're having an affair."

318
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 This is way worse. And he's like, "No, no, no, no."

319
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 And then I went to go get the nipple out of my throat by drinking some water.

320
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 And then my penis started to hurt, and I looked down, and there was two blonde alien hairs wrapped so tightly around my penis that,

321
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 as it got bigger, it was like cutting off circulation.

322
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 At this point, the wife's like, "Why are you getting turned on?"

323
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I wasn't getting turned on. It was alien magic.

324
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 But I unwrapped the hairs. I put him in a baggie.

325
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 That's okay. To be fair, that story could be 100% made up.

326
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 It definitely sounds fanciful.

327
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 But we're gonna start getting into some stuff because they test the hair.

328
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 This is where the story gets bizarre.

329
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 He ends up starting like a UFO group in Sydney in like 1992.

330
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 'Cause back then, when I was a kid, like, if you were abducted, there's no internet.

331
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 It's not like you're getting abducted. You're like, "No, no, let me email my friends and tell them where I'm at!"

332
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 You weren't able to connect with other abductees or other people.

333
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 It was really hard for people who were into paranormal conspiracy stuff to really contact each other.

334
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 They had like mailing groups and stuff like that.

335
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 If you didn't know people in town, though, you were kind of boned.

336
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 He ends up starting a UFO abductee type thing in Sydney.

337
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 He ends up meeting a big UFO researcher.

338
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 His name is Bill Chalker.

339
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 Bill Chalker is the one who actually wrote the book "Hair of the Alien."

340
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 Bill Chalker has this weird thing called like the "Invisible College,"

341
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 which isn't Hogwarts or anything cool like that.

342
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,500
 Apparently, I think he just has contacts with research groups

343
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 that don't want to be associated with his work, 'cause, you know, they're legitimate scientists

344
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 who have an interest in the paranormal.

345
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 It seemed to be something like that.

346
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 Back in 1993, Bill Chalker finds out about the story and says, "Do you still have the hair?"

347
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 And Peter goes, "I do. I still have the hair. It's in this little baggie."

348
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 And Bill Chalker sends it to get DNA tested.

349
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 So this is where we get a lot of real interesting weird details.

350
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 They're human. It's human hair.

351
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 And you're like, "Jason, that's not weird or interesting."

352
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,500
 But you didn't let me finish.

353
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 Just get scientific, 'cause I'm gonna read this from the article.

354
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 "Think About It Docs" is where-- there's a website called "ThinkAboutItDocs.com."

355
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 It'll be in the show notes. They have a lot of really, really weird stuff on there.

356
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 I've been going to the website a lot lately.

357
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 I'm gonna read this directly from their article, 'cause I don't know how else to put it.

358
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 "After thorough testing of the hair samples, the scientists of the anomaly physical evidence group,

359
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 which was Bill Chalker's group, arrived at a startling conclusion.

360
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 The thin blonde hair, which appeared to have come from a light-skinned Caucasian type woman,

361
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 could not have come from a normal human of that racial type.

362
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 Instead, though human, the hair showed five distinctive DNA markers

363
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 that are characteristic of a rare subgroup of the Chinese-Mongoloid racial type.

364
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 A detailed survey of the literature on variations in mitochondrial DNA

365
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 comprising tens of thousands of samples,

366
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 showed only four other people on record with all five of the distinctive markers in the blonde hair.

367
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 All four were Chinese with black hair.

368
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,500
 And you go, "Well, she just dyed her hair."

369
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 Everything on this seems to be pretty well researched, 'cause of course you just have the guy telling the story,

370
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 but they took a sample of his hair, they took a sample of Vivian's hair, it didn't match either of theirs.

371
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 The hair was not chemically treated, because I guess when you do chemically treat hair

372
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 it makes it harder to get like that mitochondrial DNA, something like that.

373
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,500
 I know like Vivian's hair was a hard time 'cause she does dye her hair,

374
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 so they're like, "This blonde hair, this was blonde hair that was not chemically treated,

375
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 that only matches people of an Asian descent type."

376
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 And even then it's so incredibly rare that there's only been four people who have been matched with the same setup.

377
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 So who are those four people? They flying around spaceships? No.

378
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 But they are, however, for the most part connected to a particular region in China.

379
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 It's weird, guys.

380
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 A region in China where we have found mummies of white people from thousands of years ago.

381
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 You have a blonde woman and an Asian woman appear in his bedroom.

382
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 The blonde woman's hair gets wrapped around his penis.

383
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 That matches a DNA sequencing of Asians from an area where we know for a fact

384
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 that Caucasians were settling in.

385
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 There's a place called the Taklamakan Desert.

386
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 It's in China. It's like one of the 16th biggest desert.

387
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 I had too much research on the desert and it's a weird place as well.

388
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 And they found in the area the Taklamakan mummies.

389
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:06,500
 Tall Caucasian people buried in the clothes and the customs of the culture out in China.

390
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 These mummies are hundreds of years old, thousands of years old.

391
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 They've been there for a long time.

392
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 People don't know where they came from. Historians go, they could have been from Iran.

393
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 They could have been from Eurasia. They're definitely not indigenous to China, though.

394
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 White can't really tell the hair, but they're definitely Caucasian

395
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 and then there's Asian mummies near them as well.

396
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 Taklamakan Desert.

397
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 Nobody knows what that name means. There's lots of different theories what that name means.

398
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 Let's look at the name of the desert, Taklamakan Desert.

399
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 Nobody knows what this word means. They have a few theories, though.

400
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 They think it could be Uyghur. They think it could be Uyghur word.

401
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 They think it could be a Turkish word. They think it could be a more local word for what this desert means.

402
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 But no matter who named it, these are the three English translations,

403
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 depending on whether it's Uyghur or the other two things I named.

404
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 Here are the different names.

405
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 Abandoned Place.

406
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 Place of No Return.

407
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 Or The Place of Ruins.

408
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 And now we've cracked open the conspiratorial egg of a lost civilization.

409
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 A place that has mummies that are close to 4,000 years old.

410
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 I just had to look it up. I just had to go close to 4,000 year old mummies of Caucasian and Asian descent.

411
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 In an area that was named so long ago, we don't know why it has that name or who named it,

412
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 but it means a place of ruins, an abandoned place.

413
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 A hyper-advanced civilization once existed there that left or was run out or went somewhere not of this earth.

414
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 Leaving behind only a few mummies and a vast wasteland covering their tracks.

415
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 A man is visited by two beautiful naked women and comes away with a piece of physical evidence.

416
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 That is human hair, case closed, right?

417
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 But when that human hair connects a Caucasian woman to a unknown group of people on the outskirts of a brutal desert

418
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:51,500
 named The Place of Ruins, you have to think, is there something more to the story

419
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 than a man who took a shovel to the head, took some painkillers, and had a trippy dream?

420
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 It's one thing to make up a story and have people believe it.

421
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 It's harder to come away with physical evidence of a hoax,

422
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:16,500
 but when that physical evidence matches four people's DNA from a particular region in China that is known to have Caucasians in it,

423
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 that's hard to hoax.

424
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,500
 Is there something under the desert?

425
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 Are those mummies a remnant of a lost civilization?

426
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 Does The Place of Ruins hold secrets far beyond human understanding?

427
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 Who knows?

428
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 But it's possible that all this talk of Atlantis, all this talk of Lemuria,

429
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 the best proof we may have of a lost advanced civilization existing on Earth,

430
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
 was found wrapped around a man's penis.

431
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
