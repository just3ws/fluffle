1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 Grab those peanuts and crackerjacks, guys. We are going to a baseball game first off.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,640
 Is the sport of baseball actually a ritual that shows man's place in the universe?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,200
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story coming out of Chicago in 2013.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,360
 When the Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers were playing a game, is it possible someone

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:31,520
 actually flashed a spell in front of millions of viewers to change the course of the game today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:43,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,680
 So, play ball! We're gonna get this. There's gonna be a lot of those puns. Actually, that

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,040
 I'm the only one and it wasn't even a pun. I'm gonna take my bat out and I'm gonna smack a ball,

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:05,200
 and it's gonna be caught by one of our legacy Patreons, Ash Adams. Ash snatches that ball right

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,440
 out of the air, pitch it back to me while I'm doing the rest of my intro. You're gonna be our pilot

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,320
 this episode, our pitcher. If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that too. Just

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
 help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot. Hit the ball. It's going

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,440
 over. I'm not gonna just hit the ball. I'm like, "Hey guys, come listen to my podcast. It's gonna be

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,840
 me making ball noises for 30 minutes." But we are gonna be talking about baseball and it's funny.

16
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 I've done a couple episodes recently about sports conspiracies. I'm actually surprised that it took

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
 me so long to get to these ones. I didn't know they existed, but I was looking pretty hard at

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
 sports conspiracies and these just both kind of popped up on the same day. So, Ash Adams, let's

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,040
 hop in that dead rabbit dirgeable. We're gonna need an old, tiny vehicle because first off,

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,880
 we're going back in time, going through the time vortex. We're going back to 1800s America. We see

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,160
 a bunch of people walking around with bats and balls and then they start clubbing each other

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,800
 with the bats. It's a very brutal time in American history. But when they're done destroying their

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,600
 enemies with these bats, we're gonna take a quick look at the history of baseball. There was a bunch

24
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,560
 of different versions of baseball going on. You have the Massachusetts version. You have the New

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,240
 York version. I'm sure they had an Arizona version where they just throw in dirtcloths. Very short

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 game. All the balls keep exploding. Depending on what state you were in, the rules were kind of

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,360
 played differently. There were similarities. Both New York and Massachusetts had the diamond,

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,960
 had the baseball diamond. They had a ball, obviously, and bases. The funniest thing, though, was,

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,760
 you know, the version we know today is the New York version. And in the New York version,

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
 you have to run along the baseline. You have to run from home to first base to second base.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,920
 There's that line you can really can't deviate off of. In the Massachusetts version, you could run

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,400
 anywhere you wanted to. You could totally, like, if someone's on first base, you're like, "Ah!" and

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
 you're like running off into the outfield. And people are constantly throwing balls way out there

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,600
 to get you. Everyone must have had really, really good upper body strength. You just run wherever

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,160
 you're up in the stands. You're like, "Ah, I can't get me." You could. You could do whatever. Okay,

36
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,320
 maybe not the stands, but you could run anywhere you wanted in the field. You're changing your

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,360
 uniform real quick. You come out as a player on the other team. "Huh? What's going on?" They got rid

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,400
 of that. The New York version was like, "No, we don't do that. We don't put up with that tomfoolery."

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,160
 The reason why they settled on the New York version, because it was easier to bet on,

40
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 and you could put side bets on during pretty much any point in the game. "Hey, I bet you

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,360
 this guy's going to hit a grounder to the left field." Oh, yeah, I bet you 10 bucks. It was a game.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
 It was considered a kids game for a long time until betting came into it.

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,800
 Now, here's... I have to go off on this because I thought this was funny too. There's nothing to do

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,520
 with the episode, but this has just become a sports podcast today. Ash Adams is like, "Great,

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,560
 this is the episode I'm on. I don't even like baseball." Yeah, you do, Ash. Yeah, you do.

46
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
 But this next part has nothing to do with baseball. American baseball is older than American football,

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,520
 but football apparently goes back to the medieval times, right? And I thought this was

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,480
 hilarious. This was the old version of football back in medieval Europe. You'd have two towns.

49
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
 It's funny because you can see the parallels, obviously, to today. Well, obviously, there's

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 two towns, but you'd have two towns, right? And you had unlimited players. So one group may have

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
 bring out their 13 biggest guys in town. The other town could bring out literally like two,

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,560
 300 people and be like, "We know the Black Play decimated your team last year, but we still got

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,640
 200 people." And they would take an animal's bladder and they would inflate it with air.

54
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,520
 Whose job was that? How was that to blow into the sheep lung? And then they would try to get it

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,400
 to the other person's town. I mean, how long did these games last? They're like,

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,280
 "It's day three of game one." And you would run from your town, like you would start in the middle,

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,480
 and then you would get this inflated sheep bladder or whatever it was. And you would have to run it

58
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,520
 to their town. Now, you would pick where you wanted your goal to be. You had to jump over a

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,000
 couple of pigs or whatever. That's our end zone. But the example that Wikipedia gave was, for example,

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,880
 people may use the local church as their end zone, which is the best end zone ever, right?

61
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
 They're doing mass. You're running with a sheep bladder during mass. You're knocking nuns over.

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,920
 You spike it right in the altar. The coach gets a bucket of holy water dumped on them.

63
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,600
 That would be, I would watch every medieval football game possible if that was still in effect.

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,920
 If I lived in medieval times and I was able to walk from town to town, they're like, "Oh, great.

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,600
 Turn over. You got to walk all the way back to your own town." But anyways, that has nothing to do

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,160
 with baseball. I would just have no other opportunity to talk about that. And I found the hilarious.

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,120
 Okay, so I've gone off topic. Let's go back to baseball. We're sitting in the stands. We're eating

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,200
 popcorn and stuff like that. We're watching these guys play baseball out in the field.

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,080
 Now, according to, there's a website called Southern Cross Review. And on this website,

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,720
 there is an article written by Hannah M.G. Shapiro called "Baseball as an Esoteric Ritual."

71
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
 This is an interesting one because it could be one of those exercises where you can literally

72
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,200
 take anything and find really deep meaning in it. Or there could be something else here.

73
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,840
 But before we get into Hannah's thing, I want to talk about this too. I saw this video on a

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,360
 YouTube channel called Catholic Breakfast. And he was talking about, again, there's this dude

75
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
 talking about deeper meaning in baseball. And that was interesting because he said,

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
 "Most sports are designed as competition, like that medieval town thing, where like hockey and

77
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,840
 basketball and football and soccer, you have two pieces of territory and you're trying to get

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,080
 something into the enemy territory or get something into your territory, into your hoop."

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,240
 Type of thing. He said, "Baseball is the only main sport that's not like that, at least in America,

80
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,600
 where you're not trying to get into the enemy's territory." He actually said, "It's interesting

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,240
 because it's one of those sports where the other team is not the enemy, the ball is the enemy.

82
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
 You're trying to get that ball as far out. That ball is coming towards you and you're

83
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
 trying to hit it and you're trying to get as far away from you as possible. And there happens to

84
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,960
 be obstacles who are the players, but they're not the exact adversary. You're never invading their

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
 territory in that sense as we think of football or basketball or things like that."

86
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,680
 But going back to Hannah, she said that baseball is played in a perfect geometric square.

87
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,120
 Other sports are played in a giant rectangle. So right there, baseball is already separate. And

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,760
 also from that one video, you're not going into the enemy's territory to be messing with them.

89
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,040
 There's four bases, and those four bases are supposed to represent the four elements.

90
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:59,520
 Now, home is obviously supposed to represent earth. She says it's because it's dusty. I just think

91
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
 that you're just kind of reaching to that point. I just think the very sense that it's called home

92
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:14,480
 base. And basically, the ritual is this. God or fate is throwing a ball towards you. And you have

93
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,600
 to use all of your inner strength to move that ball away from you out into the universe. And then

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,960
 you travel through the universe. The third base is supposed to be the represents fire, because it's

95
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,600
 known as the hot turn. But no one knows what the other two bases are supposed to be ever at

96
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,720
 several websites, and they go, "Home is earth, and third base is fire." And then they just go on to

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,160
 the next paragraph. I'm like, "What about first and second?" So you could say water, wind, however

98
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,440
 you want to organize that. But the point is, is that the picture is basically God's messenger

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,960
 throwing out esoteric secrets towards you, man. Then you have to run through the cosmos

100
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,880
 and get back home with the knowledge you've gained while you were traveling around.

101
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,320
 It's fascinating. I mean, it obviously could just be reaching too far. They also have this whole

102
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:13,760
 thing about how there's three strikes. There's three outs. There's nine innings. There's nine players

103
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
 without the designated hitter. So you have all those things. There's four balls, but you could say,

104
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
 "Yeah, there's just four. Sometimes four appears too." But three strikes, three outs, nine innings.

105
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,960
 It's also one of the very few sports games. It's funny recently when I did my episode about

106
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,840
 naked baseball. A lot of you guys responded saying, "Baseball already takes forever if you

107
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,520
 have to have sex at every single base that would go on forever." It's one of the few sports that

108
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,480
 has no time limit. Almost every sport has a clock going. A baseball game can be as short or as long

109
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
 as it needs to be. If you have three up, three down, three up, three down, three up, three down,

110
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,360
 over and over and over again, you could have a baseball game done in what, an hour? If one team

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
 gets one hit and then everyone else is just three up, three down, three up, three down,

112
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,520
 or they could go on for eight hours. Because it's not about the time. There is no time limit.

113
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,720
 You play until the game is done or until it's called for rain or until the heat depth of the

114
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,080
 universe, but there's no time limit to it. That's another interesting thing about the sport of

115
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,880
 baseball. It's interesting because when I was thinking about this story, I thought, "You're

116
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,120
 right. Baseball kind of reminds you of the hero's journey where it's one person. Football, basketball,

117
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,000
 all those other sports, there are two teams are going at it. You have one person going out onto

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,160
 that base and that person is versus the entire team. All these obstacles out there in life.

119
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,760
 You hit it as far as you can and you can get to home if you hit a home run, but even if you just

120
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,640
 get on first base, the game is still then that next person who steps up to the plate. Who can

121
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,040
 assist you in getting back home? The game is centered on that one person on home plate trying

122
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,320
 to hit that ball. So it's like that hero, you're taking that journey. It is very esoteric. A lot

123
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
 of times this stuff when they go like, "Oh, television. Get it? Tell a vision. It's all about

124
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,960
 story." That's not where that comes from. Tell is over distance and vision is because I can see it. So

125
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,600
 sometimes you can really make these things overrot. This one actually kind of makes sense. It kind

126
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,280
 of makes sense that baseball is such an odd sport when compared to these other ones that there could

127
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,400
 be some sort of esoteric meaning behind it. Hannah, when she was writing this article, it could have

128
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,640
 been tongue-in-cheek because it's titled as an esoteric ritual, not is an esoteric ritual.

129
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
 One is a statement saying, "This is what I believe." The other one is like, "Oh, you can look at baseball

130
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,600
 under this lens." But I do think if you step back and look at the game of baseball, it does

131
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:51,040
 seem very ritualistic. Now, all sports have rituals, but this one is so different from the other major

132
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,320
 sports. Yeah, I'm sure rollerblading might represent man's place phony through the cosmos or something

133
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,640
 like that, but I think even they have like time clocks. You're actively working against one team

134
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:10,240
 versus another, things like that. Baseball is one man versus the universe. Wait, "una versus one against."

135
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,720
 May do. Did I just blow everyone's mind, including my own? What if the universe is really the story

136
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:27,120
 of us singular trying to figure our way out of it? Like, we basically each create our own universe

137
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,280
 of obstacles. That's why it's called the uni verse. You're like, Jason, that's not even close.

138
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,000
 Doesn't matter. That's it. I'm taking you out of my universe. I've just forgotten about you. You're

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,960
 like, "No, you fade away. I like you. I bring you back in reality." You realize the void was real

140
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,080
 in those brief seconds. You're never going to mess with me again. But anyways, you can do it with

141
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,280
 anything, obviously. You can pick any word. You could, any show. You could say Smurfs is really

142
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,560
 representation of man's place on the evolutionary scale and everyone's a gargamel. Whatever. Like,

143
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,160
 you can do all sorts of stuff. But this one actually is pretty weird. Like, I gotta give

144
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,800
 him credit for that. So tip of the hat to you. Tip of the baseball hat to you, Hannah. But that's

145
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,120
 not all I have for you today. Because while that's just kind of a, this is an interesting

146
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,200
 some facts about baseball hand-warmed football, as I was researching that, I came across this story.

147
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,040
 Ash Adams, let's hop in that carbonicopter. We're headed out to Chicago.

148
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,520
 We're flying around the beautiful city of Chicago. Nice and high. We're waving.

149
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,680
 Kanye West is pissing on his Grammy. How have I not talked about that yet? I guess you guys are

150
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,240
 like, "That's not what your podcast is about." Anyways, we're waving high to Kanye West for

151
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
 flying around. We're going to land in Chicago. We're going to see the sights. And then we're

152
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,800
 going to go see a baseball game. The Chicago Cubs versus the Brewers. This is June 25th, 2013.

153
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 They lose against the Brewers 9-3. Next day, Bob Vorwald, who's a journalist, covers sports

154
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,040
 for WGN, writes an article for their website called Spell I-94 Bound. And he talks about,

155
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,120
 "Hey listen, the Cubs have lost 19 of their past 21 games against Milwaukee, and they've lost the

156
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,040
 past nine in a row. Things are not good for them. Is it time to cast the spell on Miller Park?"

157
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,960
 So then Bob Vorwald tells a story about back in 1988, he was hanging out with the Houston

158
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,560
 Astros. And they had lost 11 straight games. And he's like, "Oh man, this totally sucks. I actually

159
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,960
 couldn't tell if he was a player because I was looking through their roster. I think he was just

160
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,960
 a sports reporter in Houston at the time. But the Houston Astros had lost 11 games straight.

161
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,400
 So he's walking down the street and he's like, "Oh man, that totally sucks." And he says that he

162
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,000
 feels himself be drawn into a bookstore. He walks into the bookstore and he feels himself pulled

163
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,680
 down this particular aisle and he finds a book on the occult. At this point in the article, there's

164
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:09,200
 a picture. And it's from deposit photos. It's a stock image of various occultic imagery. So you

165
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,520
 have the all-C and I. You have the Eye of Osiris, Freemasons logo, pentagram and inverted pentagram.

166
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,600
 It looked like a either for clip art or one of those sheets you would see at a tattoo parlor.

167
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,280
 It was just a white sheet with probably about 30 different random occultic images on there.

168
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,440
 And then the article continues. So you have this image. He doesn't reference it in the article.

169
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,960
 He literally just got some stock photo and put it in this article. He says when he's reading this

170
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,320
 book, he finds a spell on how to put a curse on your enemies. And he chuckles and he goes, "Let's do

171
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,840
 this. Let's do this. The Houston Astros have lost 11 games in a row. What do we have to lose other

172
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,600
 than a 12th game?" So he assembles the ingredients for the spell. He needs three twigs from three

173
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,320
 different trees. You have to spit on them. You take them to where you're going to go. He added

174
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,120
 that part. That part wasn't in the spell book. He was just really like spitting on stuff. He goes to

175
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,080
 the Houston Astros Stadium and there he's joined by two fellow "co-warlocks." They're actually players

176
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,720
 for the Houston Astros at the time, Larry Anderson and Dave Smith. They spit on the twigs. He's like,

177
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,720
 "Yeah guys, you're supposed to spit on them nice and slow. Yeah, no, slower Larry. Yeah,

178
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,520
 get a nice big, big gooey one." They're like, "What? It's part of the spell. It's part of the spells."

179
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,720
 His eyes shift from side to side as he licks his lips. They spit on the twigs. They light them on

180
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
 fire and then they do this incantation. At that point, one of the... They really do this. At that

181
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,840
 point, one of the other players comes out and tells them to knock it off. Quit doing that stuff.

182
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,560
 It's kind of creepy and it's dumb as well. And also, why do you keep wanting me to spit in stuff,

183
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,480
 Bob? He's like, "What? It's part of my journalism query. You just got to spit in the cup. It makes

184
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,320
 the article so much better." He said that that night, the Houston Astros won the game and the player

185
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,800
 who came out who poo-poo the whole thing pulled a hamstring at his first at bat and didn't get

186
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,080
 to play. And he go... He finishes the article with this. "You will also notice that the winning

187
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:12,160
 pitcher that night was Nolan Ryan. Always a good idea when casting a spell to have a hall of famer

188
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,040
 scheduled to pitch." Unquote. So kind of tongue-in-cheek, right? Saying, "Yeah, we did this spell and

189
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,600
 it was kind of funny. The guy who made fun of us pulled a hamstring and then, you know, I went back

190
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,200
 there and took care of him, put it to his mouth and took out all of his spit. Told him it would help

191
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,960
 his hamstring. I'm making up his spit fetish. Don't sue me, Bob." But he goes, you know, "Yeah, we

192
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,360
 cast a spell, but we also had one of the best pitchers in baseball history there." So you know

193
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
 what are you gonna do? So he writes this article and it's kind of a funny one. And in the middle

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,640
 of the article he has that picture of stock image photo of just different symbols. So that article

195
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,840
 came out on June 26th. The first game was June 25th. He writes this article on June 26th. That

196
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,960
 night, Cubs lose four to five. So the Cubs still lose. What are you gonna expect? At this point,

197
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,120
 they have lost 11 straight games against the Brewers. So their losing streak continues.

198
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,360
 June 27th, though, the day after the article came out, the day after the Cubs lost yet again,

199
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,360
 they're playing baseball. One last time, the Cubs and the Brewers. And the Cubs win seven to two.

200
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:27,120
 And in the middle of the broadcast, the screen goes black. But it doesn't really go black. It goes

201
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,720
 blue. Blueish, black. There's some sort of weird overlay image. And on top of that

202
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:44,080
 is the stock photo sheet of occultic symbols. While the game is being broadcast out of Chicago,

203
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,360
 this is going on. And you hear the commentators. They see it too. You hear the commentators go,

204
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,640
 "I have no idea what that is." And then the other commentator says, "Apparently the baseball gods

205
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:06,880
 did know." The image disappears. The baseball game is back up. I had to work really, really hard to

206
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,160
 find any proof of this. Because what happened was I started seeing screenshots of these weird

207
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,800
 symbols appearing during this baseball game. And I'd read this article and they would say,

208
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,480
 "Click here for the video." And you click on it, there'd be no video for it. Before it News is a

209
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,440
 website, which is the equivalent of the Daily Star, they just published a ton of nonsense.

210
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,960
 They actually took their article down about this. Which made me think that it must be fake.

211
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,320
 Because when I first came into the story, I had heard that these images were flashed during the

212
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,600
 baseball game and there was like a blurry still photo. So I had to go back. I found this article.

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
 I had to really go back and try to piece it. First off, I didn't know if it was real. If it was just

214
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,600
 a screenshot, someone made it up. And then I find this whole story about Bob Vorwald,

215
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,680
 you know, talking about casting the spell in 1988 and things like that. It took me a long time to

216
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,920
 research this story, longer than normal. Longer than normal. A lot of times I'm able to get all

217
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,280
 the information I need very quickly on this stuff. Then I just kind of fill out the details. I spent

218
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,240
 a long time trying to track down this video. It doesn't exist in a pure form. Very, very weird

219
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
 for something that happened in 2013. The internet was in the full swing of things. There was only

220
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,920
 seven years ago. YouTube taken down, YouTube channel taken down, the video not existing.

221
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:39,680
 I eventually found it in a 12 minute long video. The last about nine minutes into a 12 minute long

222
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:49,840
 video, it plays. There is no clip of it in existence. You have to watch this video. I actually have it.

223
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,600
 If you go to my show notes, you'll see the YouTube video. It's queued up. So you don't have to listen

224
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,840
 to the rest of the video. You can. I mean, it's just that basic thing like Illuminati,

225
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,200
 the control in the world. So the video itself, the clip itself that I couldn't find anywhere.

226
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,840
 I had to find it included in this. What my theory is, is that some, this is, this is tracking all of

227
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,520
 this back. This is my theory. WGN was broadcasting the game. And apparently this image appeared on

228
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,960
 Dish TV as well, but they would have been, or Dish Network, they would have been getting their

229
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,400
 signal from WGN, who was videotaping the game. That dates me, who was broadcasting the game.

230
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,960
 I bet you somebody at WGN had read that article, clipped that image out, and then as a joke,

231
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,080
 put it on the screen and it wasn't supposed to be broadcast. They may have put it on the screen

232
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,640
 for the people in the control room to see, or for Bob to see. I think it would be funny,

233
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,120
 but it accidentally got broadcast. Because these symbols, people have said, "Oh, this is proof of

234
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,520
 the Illuminati city are using their magical powers to control games." First off, if the Illuminati

235
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,240
 controls the world, why do they care whether or not the Cubs win? Or the Cubs would always win.

236
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
 If the Illuminati control the world and they could do whatever they wanted, why don't they just have

237
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,920
 one team win all the time? Right? Why would they have different teams win? But anyways,

238
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,040
 also why would they use a depot? Because I tracked down the actual image. I was actually going to use

239
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:21,360
 it for the episode, the stock image, but I didn't want to pay $5 for it. So I didn't. But it's literally

240
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,360
 just a bunch of mishmash of... There are occultic images, but if that's all it takes,

241
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 it's just you can literally get a clip art book to cast a spell. Then again, everyone would be

242
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,280
 doing it. I don't think that the Illuminati was using a spell to cast on this game. I think someone

243
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,360
 at WGN saw that image earlier when that article was published and thought it would be funny

244
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,720
 to pull a prank, but didn't mean for it to get broadcast. But it did get broadcast.

245
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,920
 And so on that level, I think it has a very, very plausible answer. The question is, did that affect

246
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,960
 the Cubs winning the game? There's actually a lot of questions here, because while I accept that as

247
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,400
 the skeptical answer, because that's what the evidence shows. You have this image being shown

248
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,880
 on this article, it's a bunch of mishmash. They're of different occultic ideologies, a pentagram,

249
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,120
 and an inverted pentagram. Like, one of that just knock it out. And then you have, I mean,

250
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,880
 you could obviously tell it's just a proof sheet. But why did someone work so hard to delete all

251
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
 of the video footage of this stuff? Why did the For It News take down their article on it? They

252
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,160
 published garbage on that website, right? Why did they take it down? You can really only find a

253
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:41,360
 few sources on this. You can find an article on patch.com written by Mike Pazinski called

254
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,960
 "The Colt Symbols Flash on Screen During Brewers Game." That was the first article that popped up

255
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,520
 for me. And honestly, it was pretty much the last. Like, that's the last place out there that has

256
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,760
 all this information. You have that, and then you have him linking out to other places and the links

257
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,360
 don't work. There was another website called "Silence's Acceptance." And that is where I found

258
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,440
 the video embedded that nine minutes into it actually had the clip that I wanted. This is one

259
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,360
 of those stories where it's not the story itself that makes me believe in it. It's the cover-up

260
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,160
 that makes me believe in it. This information should be out there everywhere. The fact that

261
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 somebody has gone through the trouble to copyright strike these videos, to have these articles taken

262
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,160
 down, to really make it very hard to find information on. Very, very weird. It's not the crime, it's the

263
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,960
 cover-up. It's not the fact that a cult image has appeared during a baseball game, which is weird in

264
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,240
 and of itself. But the fact that someone has gone through a lot of trouble to keep that information

265
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,640
 hidden, that is what I find so disturbing about this story. Yeah, it's not the crime, it's the cover-up.

266
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,240
 So was it a harmless prank? Or was it a spell cast during an already esoteric ritual?

267
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,480
 What happens when you combine two forms of magic at once and show it to millions of people?

268
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,840
 We don't know the answer to that. But we know someone is trying to keep us from discovering this story.

269
