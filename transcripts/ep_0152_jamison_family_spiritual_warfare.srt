00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 Today we journey to Borneo to visit the grossest whorehouse ever,

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,080
 well at least that we know of.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we look at a story known as Jameson Family Spiritual Warfare.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,840
 Was a family of three driven from their home by white supremacists?

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,360
 By a religious cult in their area?

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,240
 Or by something not of this world, a dark demonic force?

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,360
 That eventually made the family disappear today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:45,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,840
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. However, I do have to start the episode off with this briefly.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,600
 I planned on episode 3 running till the middle of February where I have a planned trip for new listeners in between seasons.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
 I take a week off.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,080
 Seasons are normally 50 episodes each and right now we're already on episode 151, I believe.

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,400
 And I don't think I can make it that long without a break.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,560
 It's a 10 week work schedule to produce 50 episodes and I'm just getting grueled.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,400
 I'm just I don't know if that's a word. I know it's a word,

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,800
 but I'm just getting worn down by all the back and stuff, the recording the episodes and the editing and stuff like that.

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,520
 I'm fine with it. It's doing all the tagging and marketing and stuff like that.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,320
 That's really starting to wear me down.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,520
 So this is how it's gonna have to go.

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,160
 Today's episode and then we'll have tomorrow's episode and then that will be the end of season 3.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,080
 I'm gonna take a week-long break off.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,160
 I'll be back for the first week of February,

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,280
 but then I'm gonna have to take a couple days off in the middle of February as well.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
 Because I don't think I can produce 10 or 12 or whatever more episodes.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 Actually, yeah, it would be about 10 more episodes to get me to that trip in February.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,440
 I don't think I can do it.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,760
 I think I'm just getting worn down by a lot of the back and stuff.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,880
 And I think people who have emailed me who haven't gotten responses lately,

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,480
 that's why normally I'm really good at responding to people,

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
 but it's just been a...

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,440
 Everything's just kind of starting to bog down in the back.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,280
 So I need to take that break. I'll get respond to all the emails and things like that.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
 We're gonna... So today, tomorrow, and then we're gonna take a week off.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
 We'll come back and then we'll take a couple days off in February.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
 So I apologize, but I do need that break after that...

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,240
 After 50 episodes. I really need a week to kind of recharge.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,080
 I think that's a better alternative than keep going until I just give up

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,320
 and say, "I'm just totally burned out and walk away."

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,520
 You have to kind of walk away and rest before things get too rough.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,040
 So that being said, I apologize it's on such short notice.

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
 It wasn't my original plan, but we will go ahead and move on with the episode.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,840
 Now we're going to go ahead and we are going to visit the country of Borneo.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
 Somewhere in the...

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,440
 When does it stop being the Pacific Ocean?

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,880
 Like, Hawaii is in the Pacific, right?

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,760
 But at what point is it like after that the bottom part of Africa

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,520
 where it becomes the Atlantic again?

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,560
 At what point do they go, "Now you're not in the Pacific anymore."

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
 I'm sure somebody knows that.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,280
 I'm sure there's actually a scientific reason for that.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,120
 But anyways, I believe that Borneo is a country in that region,

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
 in the Asia region, an island most likely, because it has a short name.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
 Countries with short names are islands.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,400
 I bet you didn't know that, Peru.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
 So we're going to go ahead and we're going to Borneo.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,960
 And in Borneo there is a palm oil farm.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,040
 So that's not a pun, but we are visiting a brothel.

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,240
 You figure if you were harvesting palm oil you'd just be like, "I'm good.

59
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,920
 This is all I need.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
 This and a sexy coconut and I'm good."

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
 Anyways, in Borneo at this palm oil farm there's a brothel.

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
 You know, because they get tired of using the palm oil they want some female companionship.

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
 It's only a couple quid, which in real money is a couple bucks,

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,440
 a couple bucks of American money.

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,800
 You can go to this whorehouse, you pay to bang a chick.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,360
 Or if you're really feeling adventurous at this particular whorehouse,

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
 you can bang Pony.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now Pony, confusingly, is not a pony.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
 It's not an equine of any sort.

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,600
 Pony is a prostitute.

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
 And also a shaved orangutan.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,520
 So for a couple bucks at this whorehouse, you could go there and bang an orangutan.

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,920
 Now, there's a lot of things I don't understand about this.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
 One, they have working prostitutes at the whorehouse.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
 It's not like they're like, "Damn it Jimmy, no one wants to work here."

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
 And some guy seeing like an orangutan like climbed from the trees and he's like, "Hmm,

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
 I have an idea."

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,000
 So there was active working prostitutes there.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,480
 I don't understand why they had to go get an orangutan.

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
 Two, why'd they shave it?

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 Like it's an orangutan.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
 It's not going to look any better bald.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
 It'll actually probably look worse.

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,120
 You would think just banging the monkey would be bad enough.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
 I can't imagine someone being like, "You know what?

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,560
 I really want to bang that primate, but it's too hairy."

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,080
 Like even though it looks nothing, there's nothing attractive about any sort of monkey.

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,800
 The only thing that's stopping me from banging monkeys is the amount of hair they have.

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,920
 That's completely ridiculous.

90
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
 Anyways, they shaved it.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,320
 They put makeup on it, which again, why?

92
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
 It's not worth the effort.

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,600
 But dudes are paying to bang Pony.

94
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
 But here's where we get super gross.

95
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
 I mean, that's not bad enough.

96
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
 A shaved orangutan.

97
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
 It was tied to the bed.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
 Gross?

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
 It's pretty gross.

100
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,560
 I mean, I guess it's gross, but quite logical.

101
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
 Because otherwise, everyone who paid money would come out there like,

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,880
 "How was the sex?"

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,680
 He was like, "It was fine."

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 It's like she ripped my face off.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
 Like you would have to tie it down, but I mean, you're basically...

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
 It's not consensual.

107
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,200
 You're...

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,800
 I guess it's always not consensual when you're banging an orangutan.

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
 But it's even less consensual is...

110
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,080
 I don't know.

111
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
 It was only six years old.

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,800
 So now, not only are you banging an orangutan, you're also a chomlester.

113
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
 So, you know, that's gross.

114
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,760
 That's even grosser.

115
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,040
 Just so you don't go, well, in human years, an orangutan.

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,600
 No, no, no.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
 That's six.

118
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
 It matches up.

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,760
 So basically, it was a six-year-old girl.

120
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,480
 And she was taken as a baby and raised by the whorehouse people to become a prostitute,

121
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,360
 apparently.

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
 And when a dude would walk in the room, it would start like gyrating its hips.

123
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,040
 I mean, dude, I mean, it's so super disgusting.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,080
 It was almost at that point just trained and traumatized to

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
 bang these palm oil workers.

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,320
 And then, if that's not enough to make you grossed out or just shut the podcast off,

127
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,280
 she was also...

128
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,320
 Because she never moved.

129
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
 She was tied to this bed.

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,600
 She was also covered in bed sores and abscesses and mosquitoes were all over her.

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,720
 So we have an orangutan that's leaking pus.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
 That's six years old.

133
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
 That's an orangutan tied to a bed and people were still paying money for it.

134
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,360
 Eventually, so this really story broke back in 2003.

135
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,800
 I originally found it in my, I believe, the new news folder.

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,720
 Eventually, the police were like found out and they're like, that's disgusting.

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
 We have to go stop this.

138
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 This is so gross.

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 They're just right in their police report.

140
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,720
 They draw a picture of a cop throwing up.

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,960
 They go to the place to free the orangutan and they didn't want to let them go.

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
 The whorehouse and the people of the palm oil plant were like, no.

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
 How dare you try to take our pony?

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,480
 This person's, this is one of our natural treasures.

145
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,680
 Like they actually were, they really wanted to bang this thing.

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
 They wanted to bang this thing.

147
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
 They'd been doing it for years.

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,280
 They want to let her go.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
 35 police officers had to show up.

150
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,160
 There was an armed standoff between the whorehouse and pony's fans and the police.

151
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,120
 Eventually, the police though did get pony out of there and the whorehouse owner,

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
 the quote was the madam cried bitterly when pony was rescued.

153
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
 You're selling her body to get raped, dude.

154
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,960
 Why are you upset now?

155
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
 But she did bring in a lot of money for the whorehouse.

156
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
 It might have been that 10 years later.

157
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
 So pony's still alive.

158
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
 Well, she was as of 2013.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
 That was the last article I could find on her.

160
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,280
 She is, for a long time, she hated dudes, which is quite understandable.

161
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,040
 Kind of weird that she didn't hate women considering the madam was a woman,

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,920
 but probably just had more experience, a bad experience with dudes.

163
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,200
 Hated dudes for a long time.

164
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,680
 Wouldn't work with male zoo workers and stuff like that.

165
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
 Always kind of like hid in its enclosure.

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
 She's safe now.

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,280
 She's doing healthy.

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,960
 She's got all her muscle tissue back.

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,160
 She can now go up and hug a dude and not worry about anything.

170
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,080
 And she's just hanging out with other orangutans.

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
 Gross.

172
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
 Do you, how gross of a human do you have to be?

173
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
 To really get involved in any sort of sexual slavery.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,600
 I wonder whose idea it was to get the orangutan at first.

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
 Did they find a baby orangutan and go, "Hmm, this'll make you cute pet and/or prostitute?"

176
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
 Or did they, was the orangutan already just kind of hanging out?

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
 They found it as a baby.

178
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
 And some dude comes in, he's like, "I already banged on your prostitutes.

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,680
 How much money for that?"

180
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
 I don't know.

181
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,600
 It's disgusting either way.

182
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
 It's disgusting either way.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,240
 But what's kind of creepy is that we know about this one.

184
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,440
 They seem to be so casual about the prostitution of a ape.

185
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
 You wonder how many other places this is happening at.

186
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,080
 How many other people, how many other brothels around the world can you just like bang a zebra?

187
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,520
 I'm actually now that I say that, I'm sure there's quite a lot.

188
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,480
 I'm sure it's very, very, very common unfortunately.

189
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
 But Pony, you got away.

190
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,320
 Good job.

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
 I'm glad you're able to get rescued.

192
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
 That's completely disgusting.

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,440
 Oh, and she's all healed.

194
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,280
 All the puss wounds are gone and all that stuff.

195
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
 She's 100% and her hair grew back.

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
 The end.

197
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,280
 So our next story is a story that was a request.

198
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
 I don't remember who requested it to me.

199
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,840
 I think it might have been just an anonymous user on 4chan.

200
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,040
 I've looked through all of my YouTube notes and emails and I don't see it.

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
 But I apologize if that's the case.

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,440
 Hit me up and we'll figure something out.

203
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,400
 This is the story of the Jameson family.

204
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,920
 Now, the Jameson family was by all accounts a normal family at the time.

205
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,720
 But then some odd things started going on that made even their family members kind of question

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
 what was true anymore.

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,040
 We're in the city of Ufala, Oklahoma.

208
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
 Now, I have no idea where Ufala is.

209
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
 I didn't even know Ufala was a word until now.

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
 It's probably a name or something like that.

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
 You have a family of three.

212
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,840
 You have the father, Bobby Jameson, his wife, Cherilyn Jameson, and little kid,

213
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,320
 little daughter, six-year-old girl named Madison.

214
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 Now, their first crime was spelling their daughter's name with a Y instead of an I.

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,800
 Quite odd.

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,280
 Should have been a telling clue to what was coming because that's a weird way to spell

217
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,760
 your daughter's name.

218
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,080
 But anyway, so the three of them living a fairly normal life.

219
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,760
 But something happens that makes the police have to look a little closer at them and they

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,920
 start to kind of unravel this weirdness.

221
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,080
 So the first thing, now I'm going to do this so the police, a little bit of foreshadowing there.

222
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,080
 The first thing that's really notable in this family's life is that Cherilyn and her sister,

223
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,400
 Nikki, are into the paranormal.

224
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,040
 And Cherilyn buys a book she calls The Witch's Bible.

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,640
 And she's like, "Oh, wouldn't this be so funny if I read this book called The Witch's Bible

226
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,280
 and the sister's like, 'Yeah, I guess, maybe.'"

227
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,760
 And that's when the delusions kind of start to set in.

228
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,280
 She begins to think that she has the power to exercise demons.

229
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,680
 And she begins to think that her house is haunted.

230
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,440
 Because she describes to her sister, once seeing this gray mist descend down the staircase.

231
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,360
 She's like, "Oh my God, that's a ghost.

232
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,360
 It couldn't be any other rational explanation for that, like, I don't know, smoke or a cloud

233
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,960
 that's in my house apparently.

234
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
 It's a ghost and it might have been."

235
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,160
 But then she also said that once her husband, Bobby, was possessed.

236
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,960
 And his eyes went black and lifeless.

237
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
 And he came at her, but she stopped it.

238
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
 She's telling her sister this stuff.

239
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
 The sister's like, "That's a little weirder than your first story about the mist coming down the stairs,

240
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
 but you know, you're my sister."

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,360
 And then at some point, Bobby also starts to get into this stuff.

242
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
 But he ups it.

243
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
 He's like, "You got the witches Bible?"

244
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
 That's nothing.

245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,520
 He goes out and buys the Satanic Bible.

246
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,720
 Now, he's reading that.

247
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
 His wife's reading the witches Bible.

248
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
 First off, I don't think there's a witches Bible.

249
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
 I think that's probably just the marketing gimmick for a book,

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
 or they just don't know what to call it.

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
 As far as like what the sister and the police are referring to it as.

252
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,400
 There is a Satanic Bible.

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,760
 It's written by Anton LeVe.

254
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
 And for the 900th time on this podcast, there's a huge difference between

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,400
 Satan people who are in the Church of Satan and like actual Satanic demonic worshipers.

256
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,520
 So if somebody was like, "I want to get involved in the dark arts and unleash chaos on the world,"

257
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,560
 the last thing you're going to want to get is the Satanic Bible.

258
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,200
 Because the Satanic Bible is like a humanist text.

259
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
 It has no spells in it.

260
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
 It's just a book that's, it's, it's, it was very cleverly marketed book.

261
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
 I'll give him that.

262
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,720
 But it's not like this grand grimoire of like dark spells to unleash the ancient ones.

263
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
 It's a book.

264
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,040
 So anyways, he's reading the Satanic Bible, most likely bored out of his mind.

265
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,960
 His wife is reading the witches Bible.

266
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,560
 Eventually, the local minister in town gets a visit from these two.

267
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,000
 And that's when Cherilyn first says, "I can exercise demons."

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,360
 I can actually exercise demons from people.

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,160
 Ministers probably like, "What? I can't even do that."

270
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
 Okay, whatever.

271
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,240
 How do you know?

272
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
 And she's like, "Well, I don't know.

273
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,720
 I'm just assuming."

274
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
 And she might have told him the story about the husband getting possessed and her stomping it.

275
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
 And she told him, she said, "I'm reading the witches Bible right now."

276
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
 And the minister's like, "Hmm, interesting."

277
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,800
 Now, I don't know if they went at the same time, but the husband also went to the minister.

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
 And I, from what I've read, it sounds like they showed up at different times.

279
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,320
 The minister, once Cherilyn leaves, the minister's like, "God, she is so weird."

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
 And then her husband walks in and he's like, "Oh, damn it."

281
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,960
 The husband says, the husband's talking to the minister and says,

282
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,280
 "We're being haunted by demons.

283
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,800
 There's demons in our house, minister.

284
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,760
 You have to help us.

285
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,640
 You have to help us."

286
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,480
 And the minister's like, "Okay, let go of me.

287
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,640
 Just stand back.

288
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
 Don't have to grab onto me."

289
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
 And then he didn't actually grab onto him.

290
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,680
 I should be clear.

291
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
 He didn't assault the minister.

292
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
 Bobby then asked the minister, "Hey, psst.

293
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
 This isn't a bit.

294
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
 This actually happened."

295
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
 He's like, "Hey, minister guy.

296
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,080
 Do you have any supernatural bullets?"

297
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,280
 The minister's like, "What?

298
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,840
 What?"

299
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,360
 He's like, "Do you have supernatural bullets?

300
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
 I want bullets that can shoot demons and hurt them."

301
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,720
 Now, at this point, I think any rational person of pretty much any religion,

302
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,000
 outside of some cult that encourages this type of behavior, would be very, very concerned.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,400
 Because now you have two people in the same family talking about ghosts and demons

304
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,200
 in their house, and that's kind of par for the course.

305
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,160
 But now they're also saying stuff like, "We can stop them.

306
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,280
 I just need the right weaponry to kill them."

307
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,640
 That's the thing.

308
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,120
 If a family comes to a minister and says, "I think my house is haunted,"

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
 they'll look into it.

310
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,720
 But if they're like, "My house is haunted, do you know how to build a holy flamethrower?"

311
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,640
 That's when it's at a different level, a different level of worry.

312
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,240
 Now, people in the area kind of started to think that Sherilyn might actually be a witch.

313
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,080
 It sounds like Sherilyn encouraged that behavior,

314
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,320
 because she was in a feud with some neighbors, and throughout the court,

315
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
 and there's not a lot of detail on this either,

316
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
 and this is where we're going to get into a lot of the mystery of it.

317
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,280
 The Jamiesons were in a feud with some local neighbors,

318
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,040
 and we don't know what the nature of the feud was.

319
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
 No one's saying what it was, or even who the neighbors were.

320
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,160
 But during the course of this feud, three of her cats, of the Jamieson cats, were killed.

321
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,280
 Now, the Jamiesons had a huge shipping container on their property,

322
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,600
 and someone "someone spray painted on the side of it,

323
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
 witches don't like their black cat being killed."

324
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
 Now, some people have thought it was the locals spraying that saying,

325
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,360
 "Witch, witch, witch."

326
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,800
 I think it was Sherilyn who sprayed that, because it's a warning to people.

327
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,400
 So, someone wanted spray paint that and be like, "Yeah, isn't that right?

328
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,240
 Witches don't like their black cat being killed."

329
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,280
 Like, that doesn't make sense, but it's putting it up as a warning saying,

330
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,560
 "Oh, you killed my cat, witches don't like their black cat being killed."

331
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
 I think it was them who spray painted that.

332
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,560
 But regardless, this feud seemed to continue.

333
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,840
 Now, there was a couple, they had racked up quite the enemy list in the area, actually,

334
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,200
 in this small town, Euphala, in the middle of nowhere.

335
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,640
 They had problems with Bobby's father over money.

336
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
 They had a former roommate who used to live there,

337
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,400
 who they're probably presumably friends with if not acquaintances with,

338
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,080
 that Sherilyn started to think was a member of a white supremacist gang and kicked him out.

339
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,880
 So, now you have that, if he was a member of a white supremacist gang,

340
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
 now you have them as an enemy, you definitely have him as an enemy.

341
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
 They have their neighbors as enemies.

342
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,680
 And then there was rumors that they had pissed off a colt.

343
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,320
 There was a local colt operating in the area that they were kind of running a foul of.

344
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,920
 And there was also the rumor that they began to get involved in methamphetamine.

345
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,240
 And that rumor came from people saying that the behavior was acting weird.

346
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
 They started losing a lot of weight.

347
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,040
 And at this point, they're planning on taking their shipping container,

348
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,600
 moving it out into this area, I think it's called Red Oak, Oklahoma,

349
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 but it's out into this more rural area than they're already at.

350
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,240
 And that area is known for lots of meth cooking.

351
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,880
 Now, I think another side effect of it could just be, you know, like,

352
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
 the fact that they're seeing demons everywhere and they're talking about blowing their heads off.

353
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,120
 That could also be a sign of meth psychosis.

354
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,040
 But for whatever reason, they got rumored to be involved in the meth trade somehow.

355
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,560
 And then running a foul of the colt, running a foul of the neighbors, and so on and so forth.

356
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
 So quite the enemy's list for a couple people.

357
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,600
 There's, they have security cameras all over their house.

358
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
 So again, very, very paranoid.

359
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,320
 These guys weren't just kind of like normal people going about their day.

360
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
 Like they had some troubles.

361
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
 They have security cameras everywhere.

362
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
 They're talking about fighting demons.

363
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
 They think their house is haunted.

364
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
 People think a colt's after them.

365
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
 They think someone's after them because they got these security cameras everywhere.

366
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,480
 On a cold October morning, the family of three is spotted loading their goods into the back of

367
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
 their pickup truck.

368
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,120
 Now, they had told some people that they were going to go scout some land.

369
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,120
 They were going to go purchase a piece of land to move the shipping container and just live out of

370
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
 town, live in this area.

371
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
 They hop in the pickup truck, drive away.

372
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,680
 Never seen again.

373
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,000
 So very shortly, the investigation starts because this family goes missing.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,880
 Eight days later, they find the pickup truck completely abandoned.

375
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,920
 The dog is still in the truck, malnourished.

376
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,280
 It went eight days without food.

377
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,320
 The dog's fine.

378
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
 They got their dog to a close relative.

379
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,360
 Not a close relative of the dog, but a close relative of the family.

380
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,680
 And the cops find this truck.

381
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,600
 So the cops find this truck.

382
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,920
 This is what they find in the truck, other than the dog.

383
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,120
 All the cell phones.

384
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,840
 Bobby's, Sherylins, possibly even Madison's little toy cell phone,

385
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
 Fisher Price cell phone.

386
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 That was, that's jokes and bad taste.

387
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,960
 They find $32,000 in cash in an envelope.

388
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
 So it's not like hidden.

389
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,360
 It's sitting out.

390
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,960
 They find a pill bottle from the ex-roommate.

391
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,560
 Kind of a weird clue.

392
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,120
 Her purse, his wallet, his ID.

393
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
 All left in the car.

394
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,840
 All unmolested.

395
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
 It had been sitting there for eight days.

396
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,040
 The police think foul play.

397
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,000
 Something happened.

398
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,080
 Like some reason these people drove out here and were forced out of the car

399
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,720
 and probably kidnapped or murdered, we don't know.

400
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,680
 The big question is, if that was the case, why wasn't that stuff stolen?

401
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,000
 Why, with $32,000 is a lot of money to leave behind.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,520
 Even if you were trying to make it look like something that's not true.

403
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,880
 Trying to make it look like something that's still a lot of money to leave behind.

404
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
 Family just vanishes.

405
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,240
 Four years later though, three miles from the truck,

406
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
 find three skeletons.

407
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
 They find an adult.

408
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,720
 They find a papa skeleton, a mama skeleton, and a little girl skeleton.

409
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
 The cops are like, that's kind of what we figured.

410
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,760
 We probably should have walked out three miles and found these earlier

411
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,400
 because by the time they found them, that always is weird.

412
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,680
 Like, do the cops only just walk out a mile in each direction and are like, eh.

413
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,760
 Because they so long had passed that obviously they couldn't determine the cause of death.

414
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
 It was basically just three skeletons in middle of nowhere.

415
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,160
 They know for sure matching dental records that the skeleton is Bobby's.

416
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,040
 They assume, I don't think they got the dental records on the other two,

417
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,880
 but they assume that it's all connected.

418
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
 But they might have, before you get your conspiracy cap on a go,

419
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
 they were sold in a white slavery.

420
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,960
 They may have gotten the dental records for at least the mother as well.

421
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
 Police still suspect foul play.

422
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,680
 Now, foul play could mean a lot of things, and these are kind of the working theories.

423
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,880
 The father of Bobby had something to do with it over money.

424
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,040
 It was a murder suicide.

425
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,080
 Either the mother killed the daughter and the father,

426
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,840
 or the father killed the daughter and the mother.

427
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,920
 It would be quite the amazing feat if the daughter killed both of them and then killed herself,

428
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,080
 but they think that it could be a murder suicide.

429
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,360
 The idea of a meth gang taking them out, I don't think is that plausible

430
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,600
 because the cash is left behind.

431
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,240
 And I think that the white supremacist argument isn't very likely either

432
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,920
 because the cash is left behind.

433
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,280
 And the argument of the father doing it is ridiculous as well,

434
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
 because they were fighting over money.

435
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,600
 So that really leaves us with two, three possible theories.

436
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
 One, the murder suicide, because no one's going to be like,

437
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,960
 "Hey, I'll spend this money later. Oh, I forgot. The suicide part."

438
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
 You know, that's not going to happen.

439
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,360
 There's two groups of people who would have no need for $32,000.

440
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,880
 One of them may be a little bit, but the second one wouldn't need it at all.

441
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,240
 The first one being the cult.

442
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,520
 Now, if the cult was trying to sense, and there are supposedly active cults in this area,

443
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,280
 if the cult was trying to send a message to the people in the community

444
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,520
 that we don't want your money, we just want your soul,

445
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,920
 like there's some sort of like evil cult,

446
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,440
 they would just march a family of three out, execute them,

447
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
 and leave everything else behind to show that they were bigger than money.

448
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,720
 Now, that's a little fanciful. No cult is bigger than money.

449
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,720
 Cults want financial power first and foremost.

450
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
 That's why they make all their members give stuff up.

451
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,920
 But I could see a crazy cult, a crazy supernatural cult doing that.

452
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,080
 More so than a white supremacist gang being like,

453
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
 "You know, we're going to show these people that white supremacy is awesome,

454
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
 so much that we don't want this sweet, sweet money."

455
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
 And then they would just take the money.

456
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,120
 Like, none of those other groups, I think, would leave $32,000 behind.

457
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,960
 But there's one group that definitely wouldn't need $32,000.

458
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
 Wouldn't need cell phones or ID or anything like that.

459
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,800
 Is what if... I'm gonna... I hate to say this,

460
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,560
 because I hate to indulge in their possible drug-filled delusions,

461
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,080
 but what if they were being haunted by some sort of demonic entity?

462
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
 What if he did get possessed, or one of them got possessed,

463
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
 or all of them got possessed, and were marched out into the middle of nowhere?

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,480
 Now, I don't think a demon would really care about leaving DNA or fingerprints.

465
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,040
 Why wouldn't it just massacre them in the house?

466
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,000
 If it had enough power to possess one of them,

467
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,880
 to go through with this, why not just have the slaughter take place in the house?

468
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,200
 Why have it take place in the middle of nowhere?

469
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
 Was it possible that this abandoned area that they were going to buy

470
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,200
 had some sort of dark energy to it?

471
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
 This is... I sound... This is obviously all...

472
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,040
 just guessing, and most likely not true.

473
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,520
 But... it's just such a bizarre story.

474
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,680
 Like, what if their delusions were true?

475
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,440
 And I keep wanting to say but they're not, but I mean, they might have been.

476
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,040
 What if their delusions were true?

477
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,160
 What if there was some sort of demonic possession going on there?

478
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,840
 And instead of wanting to slaughter them in the house, like, you would...

479
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,160
 I guess that's why I keep questioning it,

480
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,320
 because I think it's almost a little too complicated,

481
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
 but let's just roll with it.

482
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,000
 Demon possesses one of them, drives them up to the say,

483
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,240
 "Hey, we're gonna buy this area. Isn't this place great?

484
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
 We're gonna buy this area."

485
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,040
 And for some reason, this demonic force wants to get them out into this area.

486
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,880
 And that's where the sacrifice is done by the demons.

487
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
 Or by the cult, I didn't think about that.

488
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
 They could have been some sort of ritual sacrifice,

489
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,440
 so they got tricked to coming up here on their own,

490
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
 so there wasn't a huge trail.

491
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
 But were they being targeted by some sort of hostile...

492
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,600
 Well, I guess that's kind of an oxymoron hostile demonic force.

493
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
 Was this whole thing just to incite terror in them,

494
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,000
 to get them out of their home to go somewhere else,

495
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
 which is where they really were supposed to be for this ritual to happen?

496
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,880
 It's highly unlikely, but it's a weird twist to the story.

497
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
 Now, there are a few more details to this thing before we go.

498
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
 One of them is they found the cell phones in the car,

499
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
 and the police got the cell phones to begin looking through it.

500
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,280
 And the police believe that this photo was taken the day of the disappearance,

501
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480
 if not the day of the murder.

502
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,040
 And it's a creepy photo.

503
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,920
 It is a photo of young Madison sitting on a rock

504
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,680
 with a very, very weird facial expression.

505
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,200
 To me, it looks like she is scared or in some sort of distress.

506
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
 Other people look at it and be like, "Nah, she's laughing."

507
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
 And I'm thinking, "That's not how... that's a weird looking laugh."

508
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,920
 But again, it's just a still photo of a young girl sitting on a rock out in the middle of nowhere,

509
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,240
 supposedly taken at or near the location of where the truck was.

510
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,800
 So who took that photo?

511
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,840
 Possibly Bobby.

512
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
 Why was that photo taken?

513
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
 And why does she look so...

514
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,680
 Why does she look so worried/creepy?

515
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,480
 It's a very, very disturbing photo.

516
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,960
 And the other interesting thing about this case, and it could just be a coincidence,

517
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,680
 but the lead investigator, the lead cop who was looking into these

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,000
 disappearances, he ended up moving out of the country.

519
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
 He just was like, "I'm done."

520
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,560
 He left the country.

521
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,120
 According to Sherilyn's sister, this was because he couldn't deal with the guilt of

522
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,800
 not being able to solve the mystery.

523
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,840
 Possible.

524
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
 Maybe he was just moving away.

525
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,200
 But the minister has also moved away, left that town,

526
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
 and refuses to discuss the case to this day.

527
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:19,040
 Is there something dark in the city of Ufela, Oklahoma?

528
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:25,040
 Is there a cult working its dark magic in that area?

529
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,360
 Is it something as mundane as a meth gang or white supremacist group?

530
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:41,040
 Or is it something more terrifying that somehow a family was murdered by a demonic force?

531
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,120
 And I have to be completely honest.

532
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
 If I had to go outside of the...

533
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
 I think the most likely answer is murder/suicide, but if...

534
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,880
 Other than that, I would say it was the cult and some sort of demonic activity.

535
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,840
 Maybe this cult isn't just one of those jokey cults where we need money and we're just ripping

536
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
 people off and banging a bunch of chicks until we get arrested and thrown in prison.

537
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:10,400
 Maybe this is a cult that has actually found a way to channel demonic energy to erase their

538
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,960
 targets. Maybe the Jamesons did declare spiritual warfare on this cult.

539
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,840
 Wanting the supernatural bullets.

540
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,920
 Wanting to fight the good fight and learn how to stop demons.

541
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,240
 And instead, they were just overwhelmed by the power of these cult members.

542
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:36,560
 The cult didn't have to do something mundane like just have them shot or stick a knife through

543
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:45,040
 their heart. This cult was able to utilize powers to possess them, to get them to a location

544
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,600
 where the family would meet their end and the spiritual warfare would be over.
