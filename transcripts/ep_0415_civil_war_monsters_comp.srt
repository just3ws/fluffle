1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 I gotta be honest with you guys, this one, uh, this one's kinda breaking my brain.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,840
 This is a weird one.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,480
 Bigfoot, UFOs, cryptids, creatures of the night.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,360
 These have been sighted for thousands of years in the past, and you can still find sightings

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,860
 today.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:26,020
 But during the American Civil War, there seemed to be a bizarre rash of sightings.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,600
 The question is, are these sightings being covered up today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:39,120
 [Music]

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,360
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,520
 I really, really hope you guys did.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,200
 First off, I, I, no, I'm not sponsored by these guys at all.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,720
 This is not an ad read in any way, shape, or form.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,580
 Legally, I can't lie about that.

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,580
 This is gonna sound like an ad read, but it's not.

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,780
 Shutter, the horror movie streaming service?

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,780
 Shutter?

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,940
 Shutter.com?

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,900
 Right now is having a special 30 days free if you use the promo code shut in, S-H-U-T-I-N.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,900
 Not getting paid for that.

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,660
 I get no referral service for that whatsoever at all.

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,780
 But I'm using it right now, and I want to share that opportunity with you.

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,500
 I'm currently going to be watching movies using this Shutter thing.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,200
 And after the 30 days, it's like 5.99 a month if you do the monthly thing.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,840
 100% not an ad read.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,320
 I get nothing if you guys go to Shutter.com.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 They are not an advertiser.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,960
 I just think it's a really cool thing.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,960
 They're doing the shut in thing, obviously, because of the quarantine.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
 There's a lot of good movies on there.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,560
 I'm actually thinking about doing a little bit of a Dead Rabbit movie club since if we

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,000
 all use this, and again, I'm not getting paid, I'm not getting paid at all for this.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,680
 It would be illegal for me to say otherwise.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,820
 If we can all use this, I mean, I don't know if it applies to every country, but watch

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,060
 some good movies together and we can discuss them online.

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,980
 Tonight, I'm going to watch The Room.

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,860
 Not that The Room.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,420
 I saw the--this is what made me sign up.

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,340
 I keep seeing this advertisement on YouTube about a guy goes into a room in his house

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,580
 and whatever he wishes for appears in The Room.

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,940
 But it can't leave The Room.

45
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
 Or it can't leave the house.

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,860
 You're like, "Jason, don't tell me to plot if you don't know the plot."

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,080
 And you're like, "Okay, that's kind of cool.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,240
 He's like wishing for paintings and stuff like that."

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,720
 But his wife wishes for a baby.

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 So check it out.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
 I'm going to watch that tonight, The Room.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
 The train to Busan is also on there.

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
 That is a great one.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,640
 So Shutter.com--that totally sounds like an ad read-- Shutter.com promo code SHUTIN.

55
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 You get 30 days free.

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
 You can cancel it after that.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
 Again, I don't get paid at all.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
 I just think it's a really cool service.

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,680
 My little brother let me know about it.

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,620
 I want to give a shout out like I love to do to one of my legacy Patreons, James Milne.

61
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
 James Milne.

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,020
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

63
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,660
 Long time supporter of the show.

64
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,780
 Really, really appreciate it.

65
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,420
 We're giving you the keys of the Carpentercopter today and we're headed to the south.

66
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,500
 There weren't a lot of--you're like, "Great.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,060
 Jason's going to try to talk about Civil War history."

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,740
 As far as I know, most of the Civil War battles are in the south, right?

69
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,920
 The Southerners never really made a huge push.

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,600
 Like, I don't think we were ever fighting block to block in New York or Massachusetts

71
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 or anything like that, right?

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,560
 I'm pretty sure we were just kind of just kept going into the south stomping on them.

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,880
 Now they held their own.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 There was quite a few losses for the north, but in the end, I was always used to be a

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,040
 big Civil War buff.

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,720
 I think in a way, I kind of am, but when I was in high school, I was a big Civil War

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 buff.

78
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
 I honestly wish there had never been a Civil War.

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,940
 Now I'm not saying that I wish that slavery wasn't abolished because Britain got rid

80
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,300
 of slavery without a Civil War.

81
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,700
 It would have been interesting to see how America would have fared had there not been

82
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,940
 a Civil War, had we not gone to war with the south.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,380
 It would have been really, really interesting to see how things would have worked out.

84
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,780
 But you know, that's an alternative history thing.

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,380
 Again, you want the slaves to be free.

86
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,500
 I'm not--I have to say this now, apparently.

87
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,800
 I am not an advocate for the slavery of the south at all.

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 But Britain got rid of slavery.

89
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,420
 It would have been nice if we just could have legislated it out.

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,000
 We would have had no reconstruction period, no assassination of Abraham Lincoln, no really--no

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Ku Klux Klan.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,040
 I think all of that is guerrilla warfare from the south.

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,440
 We would have seen a totally different south.

94
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,040
 That would have been fascinating to see that nation going into World War I as opposed to

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 the one--I mean, we're still awesome.

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 Don't get me wrong.

97
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,260
 America is still pretty awesome.

98
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,500
 But anyways, anyways.

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,980
 So let's go ahead and move on to some monsters.

100
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,140
 And reload that gun ten minutes later.

101
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
 Reload it again.

102
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,140
 I'm trying.

103
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,420
 My arms are cramping up.

104
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,700
 Civil War cryptids.

105
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,620
 Now what's funny is this is something that I never really even thought of.

106
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,500
 And like I said, I was a big Civil War buff when I was a teenager.

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,160
 I'm surprised I never thought of this before because it sounds pretty badass honestly,

108
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 right?

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,240
 First off, we are going to take a look at a cryptid in Tennessee.

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,240
 Now specifically, Southwest Tennessee, Northwest Georgia, because that is where the battle

111
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,720
 of Chikamunga took place, a Chikamunga.

112
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
 And in the Battle of Chikamunga, you had the--it was one of the worst defeats, if not the worst

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,240
 defeat for the Union when they were trying to fight the Civil War.

114
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,500
 This is what they were doing while they were trying to invade the south.

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,980
 There was one of their worst defeats, if not the worst defeat, second bloodiest battle next

116
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
 to Gettysburg.

117
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
 It was really, really bad.

118
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,540
 Over the course of three days, 3,500 men killed.

119
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,060
 About 25,000 wounded and 70% of those later died of their wounds.

120
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,060
 It was really, really bad.

121
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,140
 But from September 18th to September 20th in 1863, you have the Union just trying to

122
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,380
 just push into the south.

123
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,820
 And the south is like, "Nope, not any further."

124
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,720
 [Pfft]

125
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
 Cannonballs rolling, blowing people up.

126
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,080
 Actually, they didn't blow you up, they just crushed you.

127
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,240
 Like when I was a kid, I always thought like cannons going into boats, blue boats up.

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,480
 No, they just put giant cannonball sized holes in a boat.

129
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,240
 I'm sure some of them, like maybe later on, they're like, even if you packed it full of

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,800
 explosives, I don't really know if it'd blow up.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,200
 But just putting a hole through a boat is bad enough.

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,600
 A cannonball rolling across the battlefield is pretty gruesome.

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
 It's just gonna chop you up.

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,220
 The battle at Chukamunga.

135
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,020
 You'd have the soldiers fighting during the day.

136
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,020
 There's no night vision.

137
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,980
 I mean, again, that, that, all timey wars I find fascinating too, like ancient sieges,

138
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,500
 Greeks and Romans and Persians and all that stuff.

139
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,460
 Ah, I find all that stuff super fascinating.

140
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,540
 But Civil War, the battle ends when the sun goes down for the most part, right?

141
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,380
 Unless someone's stupid enough to light a cigarette and their head's popping above a

142
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
 trench.

143
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,620
 Or, you know, they're like reading, they're reading with a lantern by them.

144
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,760
 Oh, I really want to know what happens to Anna Greengate.

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,960
 It's pretty much it ends at sunset.

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 Because you can't see nothing.

147
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,080
 Now there'd be skirmishes, people would be kind of coming around enemy lines.

148
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
 Terrifying.

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 Pitch black, maybe the moon's out.

150
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,800
 You can kind of see what's going on.

151
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
 For the most part, it would be quieter, at least.

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,760
 It could never rest, but it was a little more quiet.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,360
 But you'd have people, mostly Confederate soldiers saw this.

154
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
 They'd be hunkered down for the night.

155
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,460
 Afraid of what was going to happen when that sun came up.

156
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,220
 War is absolutely terrifying.

157
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,340
 Afraid of what was going to happen when that sun would come up.

158
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
 Writing letters to loved ones.

159
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,860
 This is kind of a dark episode, actually.

160
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:57,740
 And they'd see something prowling amongst the dead in the field.

161
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,700
 It was tall.

162
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
 Lanky.

163
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
 No.

164
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
 No.

165
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,080
 I swear it was a tiger.

166
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 Or a panther.

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,560
 Something big on four legs.

168
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 No.

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,120
 No, that's not what I saw.

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,800
 I saw a floating head.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 Moving across the battle.

172
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,640
 I saw a shadow man.

173
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,720
 Tall and dark.

174
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,680
 Blotting out the pitch black behind it.

175
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,200
 It's not what I saw, boys.

176
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,780
 I saw one of our fellow Confederate soldiers.

177
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,620
 But his eyes.

178
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,140
 His eyes were different.

179
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,020
 All over this battlefield.

180
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,180
 You'd have people see this something walking through the corpses.

181
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,340
 There's tons of different explanations for this, but they all agreed on one thing.

182
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,800
 The eyes were glowing green.

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,200
 Now some people say that this, the glowing, it's called green eyes.

184
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 It's how it's known in Tennessee.

185
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,720
 It's actually a very, very famous cryptid/goat story.

186
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
 Green eyes.

187
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,600
 Some people say it goes all the way back to the days of the Native Americans in the area.

188
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,720
 That the Indians there saw a creature.

189
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,080
 They described it as a panther with green eyes stalk in the area.

190
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,780
 But then it wasn't seen for what, about a hundred years?

191
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:35,340
 So some people believe that the bloody days, those three days where 3,500 people died,

192
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,100
 over 25,000 wounded, over like 6,000 just went missing or captured.

193
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,780
 Some people say that that brought this creature back, green eyes.

194
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,940
 People still have sightings of it.

195
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,440
 So they had sightings of it up until the 1970s, early 80s.

196
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,600
 There was a park ranger in 1976, a park ranger named Edward Tinney.

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
 He said he saw it on Snotgrass Hill.

198
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,920
 That's the Snotgrass Hill is where when the Confederates finally took the field from

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,560
 the Union and the Union had a retreat to Chattanooga, they stood up on Snotgrass Hill

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,560
 and were just taking sniper shots and they were moving artillery into the area.

201
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
 I'd overlook this town.

202
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,900
 This is a description from Edward Tinney to what he saw.

203
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,500
 "When it passed me, I could see his hair was long like a woman's.

204
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:33,460
 The eyes, I'll never forget those eyes, they were glaring, almost greenish-orange in color,

205
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,540
 flashing like some sort of wild animal.

206
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,860
 The teeth were long and pointed like fangs.

207
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,700
 It was wearing a dark cape that seemed to be flapping in the wind, but there was no wind.

208
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,000
 I didn't know whether to run or scream or what.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
 Then the headlight of an approaching car came blazing through the fog and the thing disappeared

210
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
 right in front of me."

211
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,200
 The most interesting thing about that, I mean, obviously other than the human-sized monster,

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,400
 a giant teeth is the cape that flaps like there was wind, but yet there is no wind.

213
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,960
 That's an interesting thing because to me that makes it seem almost more like a hallucination,

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
 right?

215
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,600
 Imagine Superman standing there with his arms on his hips.

216
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,000
 What's his cape doing?

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,140
 Some of you might imagine his cape perfectly still, but some of you I think would imagine

218
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,320
 a little bit of the ripple in the design, at least at the bottom, if not full on.

219
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,600
 But we imagine the kind of ripple.

220
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,280
 That's how we're used to seeing Superman.

221
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,800
 We're used to seeing capes in movement.

222
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,840
 So if you'd see a cape, that makes me think it's a little bit of a hallucination.

223
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,640
 It's all, would also be interesting to note that if this thing is not necessarily encrypted,

224
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:50,880
 but some sort of spirit or dimensional creature, the fact that the cape was moving would mean

225
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,960
 it would be being affected by something not in our reality, i.e. he's saying something

226
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,320
 in between one reality where there is wind and our reality where there isn't.

227
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,560
 That could be overthinking things.

228
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
 It's probably just the hallucination.

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,120
 But what's interesting about green eyes is that around for hundreds of years people see

230
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,880
 it as different things.

231
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,680
 Some people say it's a confederate soldier who had his head blown off by a cannonball

232
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,840
 and he's looking for it.

233
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
 That's stupid, right?

234
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,960
 Because where's his eyes coming from?

235
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,560
 Now you're thinking, Jason, why don't you make up some weirdo explanation for that?

236
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,640
 You just spent five minutes talking about capes.

237
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,760
 You don't believe a ghost need his head blown off?

238
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,800
 I mean, I believe a ghost need his head blown off, but you know, like that's kind of lame,

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 right?

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,480
 But anyway, I would honestly say what I think it was, it was probably a big old cat.

241
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
 It probably was in real life a tiger.

242
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,040
 There are like some rich guy in Antebellum South buys a pet tiger.

243
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,520
 He's buying slaves.

244
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,040
 He's getting stuff from Africa anyways.

245
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,880
 I don't think he'd be like, "No, no, no, no, no.

246
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,200
 That's endangered species.

247
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 What are you talking about?

248
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,600
 I only buy humans."

249
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 Nope.

250
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,840
 I think someone may have bought an actual tiger or a panther and then maybe his house

251
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,640
 got blown up or he was just a bad, well, he's obviously a bad person.

252
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,360
 He owns slaves, but maybe he's also a bad pet owner and just lets his tiger go out.

253
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,120
 Where is a tiger or a panther going to go?

254
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,080
 Where there's a ton of bodies.

255
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,040
 And cats have green eyes, right?

256
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,400
 Like don't their eyes kind of glow?

257
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,160
 I mean, now you're thinking, "Chase, this second one was wearing a cape, had long hair."

258
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
 Well, I'm not, I'm saying that.

259
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,120
 I think you could probably say some of the sightings were actually of a large cat in

260
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,040
 the South that got free.

261
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,640
 That these other ones might be hallucinations or it could all be some sort of phantom thing.

262
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,160
 But let's go ahead and move on now.

263
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,240
 Now I found out about green eyes because I read an article on Mysterious Universe called

264
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:51,760
 "Curious Mystery Monsters of the American Civil War."

265
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 This article was written in 2016 by Brent Swancer.

266
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,120
 He writes a ton of stuff from Mysterious Universe.

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,840
 It was published on February 3rd, 2016.

268
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,920
 What's interesting about this story, the Krakodingo, this one I'm about to talk about, is almost

269
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,000
 everything I could find about this comes from this article.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,800
 I found other articles referring to this article.

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 Start looking for Krakodingo.

272
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
 I found a bunch of other articles that were referring to this article.

273
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,340
 And then I found a few, just three or four, that predated this mysterious universe article.

274
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
 And those were very vague.

275
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,160
 We'll get into details in a second, but because this is all building up to something.

276
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,640
 This episode is really, really weird.

277
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,400
 It was really messing with my head as I've been looking into it.

278
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:42,520
 The article on Mysterious Universe is based on a book called, is based on a, this article

279
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,960
 on Mysterious Universe is based on a book, almost exclusively based on a book called

280
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,920
 The Civil War of the Worlds.

281
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,880
 First-hand accounts of UFOs and other mysterious phenomenon during America's Civil War.

282
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,980
 And this book was written by a guy named Edgar Riley.

283
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,060
 Now GreenEye's very, very well-known ghost story.

284
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,420
 This story we're about to talk about, not so well known.

285
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,100
 I can only find, like I said, most of the information is from this article, and most

286
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,420
 of the information from this article is from this book, The Civil War of the World.

287
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,020
 So let's go ahead and get started on this creature.

288
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,780
 So this is creatures known as the Krakodingo.

289
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,380
 Now don't get it confused, because there's other Krakos out there.

290
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,760
 I found this out.

291
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 Researching this, we have the, the doggigator, the doggigator, which is half dog, half alligator,

292
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,160
 proven false.

293
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,440
 So apparently people have been taking alligators and like making their legs longer, making

294
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,200
 these dummies, putting them up in their fares.

295
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,440
 Look at this amazing Krakogator.

296
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
 Fake.

297
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,040
 We have the Kunagator, which is a raccoon with a crocodile mouth, which would seem a

298
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,560
 little overwrought.

299
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,940
 Right, like a raccoon doesn't need a bigger mouth, but apparently, and I can almost guarantee

300
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,980
 what these are, apparently the Kunagator has exclusively been sighted around Mount Pelier

301
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,060
 in Vermont.

302
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,780
 It's probably just a raccoon who got his face torn off in a car accident, or some other

303
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,380
 got hit by a dog and it's all mutilated.

304
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,100
 Now you're Lincoln Jason.

305
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,460
 There's a difference between mutilated and a growing a three foot snout that's reptile.

306
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,800
 The raccoons, notorious night creatures you see them in fleeting glances, but anyways

307
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,180
 Kunagator, well known urban legend in Vermont, we have the bassigator, which is a giant fish

308
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
 with an alligator mouth.

309
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,300
 Now that is something that there are tons of fakes of, but people go, yeah, that probably

310
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,200
 existed like 65 million years ago.

311
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,760
 A fish with a giant crocodile mouth that is probably real, it basically looks like an

312
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
 dinosaur.

313
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
 There's tons of fakes.

314
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,280
 You can go all around the country.

315
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,500
 You're on the world.

316
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 People will make these fakes.

317
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,380
 Some people swear that theirs is real though.

318
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,180
 But out of all of these gators and these adiles, we have the Crocodingo.

319
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,660
 Let's go to Huntsville, Tennessee.

320
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,060
 James fired back up that carbonicopter we're flying around.

321
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,860
 Now this isn't far from where we were just at, so we probably could have just walked,

322
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,220
 but Huntsville, Tennessee, it's July 31st, 1839.

323
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,060
 There's this farmer dude hanging out his house, right?

324
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
 He has two dogs.

325
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,160
 Actually, no, they're well-behaved.

326
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
 They're not barking yet.

327
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,360
 They're like, "Hmm, hmm, hmm."

328
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
 Just laying there.

329
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,280
 And then he sees out his window some lights.

330
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,480
 "Hmm, hmm, hmm."

331
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,960
 There's not a giant cat outside.

332
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
 Dogs are super hungry.

333
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
 The dogs do start barking though.

334
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
 They start freaking out and he goes outside.

335
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
 He sees these lights.

336
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,160
 He says, "It looks like the northern lights up in the sky."

337
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,720
 "Hmm, hmm, hmm."

338
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,300
 And then he says, he sees what he disguises as a straight bolt of lightning.

339
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,140
 Like fly overhead.

340
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,780
 He turns around, crashes into the forest behind his house.

341
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,020
 The dogs are totally going nuts.

342
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,660
 They actually go nuts just when they saw the lights normally.

343
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,380
 This guy, his name is Hank Lemon.

344
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 Hank Lemon.

345
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
 He's standing there.

346
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:14,540
 He's looking and he sees in the darkness of the forest a creature, the body of a dog,

347
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,360
 the head of a crocodile.

348
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,480
 Run off at super fast speed.

349
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,680
 Through the darkness.

350
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,600
 Now I have a lot of problems with this narrative just right off the bat.

351
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,520
 First off, it's 18, tell me if I'm wrong.

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
 It's 1839.

353
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 It's Tennessee.

354
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,840
 Hank Lemon.

355
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 We don't know.

356
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,360
 First off, we'll assume these people are real.

357
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,520
 I'm not going to go into that whole thing like, "Well, I looked at ancestry.com and

358
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
 there's no Hank."

359
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
 Whatever.

360
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,780
 I know these guys, I did do that for.

361
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,180
 This story gets really, really weird.

362
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,660
 I really started digging into genealogy stuff.

363
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,380
 But let's just assume Hank Lemon is real.

364
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,880
 He's a real person.

365
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,100
 I have a couple problems with this.

366
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,540
 1839, Tennessee.

367
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,020
 Would somebody in Tennessee know what the Northern Lights look like?

368
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
 Right?

369
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,700
 There was no National Geographic back then.

370
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
 Right?

371
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
 I don't think there was.

372
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,860
 Well, there definitely was no color photography.

373
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,300
 You show some picture of, and even photography.

374
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,580
 I don't even think there was photography.

375
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,560
 So unless he had specifically been to Canada or up further north, I don't think he would

376
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
 have known what the Northern Lights look like.

377
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
 But he described it as the Northern Lights.

378
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 But whatever.

379
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,720
 We'll say that he used to hang out with Scrooge McDuck and he made his money at the Yukon

380
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,960
 and then came back to Tennessee.

381
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
 That's fine.

382
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
 I'm still a little suspicious.

383
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,840
 But again, this episode totally broke my brain.

384
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 I'm suspicious about everything.

385
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
 Wait till the ending.

386
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,800
 So the fact that he sees something, he's looking at it in the forest.

387
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 It's dark.

388
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,620
 Well, his eyes just got affected by all this light show and this lightning bolt that goes

389
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
 over his head.

390
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,860
 But he's able to see a crocodile and a dog fused into one takeoff super fat.

391
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,020
 I find that suspicious that he's able to see that level of detail.

392
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,420
 I find the whole origin of this suspicious.

393
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,540
 But we're just getting started here.

394
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,380
 He does, though, whether or not he sees the creature, he definitely smells it.

395
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
 He smells it.

396
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
 Here's a quote.

397
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,660
 "There was this horrible charnel stench in the air and something else, a horrible thing."

398
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,920
 "Something that would drive a man crazy should it be exposed to it for too long a period."

399
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,240
 A long time ago.

400
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,960
 I think round episode 200 or something like that.

401
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,920
 I talked about how a lot of times when people describe Bigfoot, a lot of times they'll smell

402
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 them first.

403
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,600
 They talk about how horrible the smell is of it.

404
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,160
 And I had a theory that people may be inhaling methane and actually they may, a lot of these

405
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,360
 paranormal events, these Bigfoot's, these cryptids, people may be walking through the

406
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,260
 woods, they get a whiff of a natural gas leak.

407
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:49,460
 They're basically overcome with fumes, the same way that the oracles at Delphi would

408
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,340
 have visions because they're over this big old gas leak.

409
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
 And that's possible.

410
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,820
 Now, so here's my thing.

411
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,220
 Like I said, Northern Lights and all this stuff, here's my thing of what could rationally

412
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
 happen.

413
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,580
 But again, we have so much stuff to talk about this episode.

414
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:10,520
 So where a meteorite crashes down and releases some sort of methane gas, which isn't a known

415
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 of.

416
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,240
 We have other things of meteorites crashing and releasing gas and things like that.

417
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
 I mean, I'm not specifically, I shouldn't say methane because that wouldn't mean that

418
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,600
 there was something living in the meteorite, but who knows.

419
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,920
 There could have been a meteorite strike actually and it punctured a hole in the ground that

420
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,440
 released some methane and he hallucinated these things.

421
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
 Who knows?

422
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,320
 But I do think there is a connection.

423
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,960
 People should look into a connection between the smell of rotten eggs and then seeing cryptids

424
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,160
 or demons or whatever.

425
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,660
 I think there might actually be a connection between gas leaks, hallucinations and a lot

426
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
 of this cryptid activity.

427
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,380
 But anyway, so he sees this thing, this thing walking in the woods.

428
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,700
 He's able to accurately say in the dark that it's monster and it runs super fast away and

429
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,340
 it smells the worst.

430
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,300
 It smells so bad it would drive a man insane, which is an amazing description.

431
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,600
 If it was just him telling the story, I want to waste your time.

432
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,200
 Maybe I would tell that story as a short thing, but this goes way more in depth because he's

433
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
 not the only person who sees it.

434
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,160
 So he may have embellished the story a bit with the northern lights and all this stuff.

435
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,680
 I don't know why I'm so hung up on the northern lights, but he could have embellished the

436
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
 story a bit.

437
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,960
 But this thing is then seen for the next 140 years.

438
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,880
 The most sightings of it were pre-Civil War 1856 to 1860.

439
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,340
 It was seen along the river eating fish.

440
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,060
 So even that's like a good 14, 20 years later.

441
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,860
 It's eating fish to the point where the fishermen in the area are trying to kill it because they

442
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,460
 believe that it's cutting down on how many fish they can actually catch.

443
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,460
 They believe it's become an apex predator.

444
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,860
 It's eating all these fish.

445
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:53,340
 During the Civil War, it is sighted standing over the body of a Confederate soldier.

446
00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:01,600
 There's a Confederate soldier named Roger Owens who is a real Confederate soldier.

447
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,160
 He was with the Kentucky Volunteer Group.

448
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,400
 He's in Tennessee, but I don't think they were like, "No, you stay there.

449
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,000
 Yeah, we're getting really beat up over here, but you stay there, Kentucky guy."

450
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,240
 He was a real soldier.

451
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,240
 He said that he saw one night, they're stationed in Tennessee.

452
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,760
 He says that he sees the body of a fallen brother, a Confederate soldier, and he sees

453
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,220
 this creature just standing over the body.

454
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,700
 Now, he wasn't actively eating it, but the guy says, "I could tell the body looked a

455
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,020
 little more torn up than the average dead soldier."

456
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,900
 And then later when they went to go check on it, the body was gone.

457
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,740
 They saw blood in the area, but the body was gone.

458
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,940
 So the insinuation is this thing was eating the dead during the Civil War.

459
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:53,280
 Nowadays, the sightings are all around a place called Oneida, or Juanita in Tennessee.

460
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,880
 In the 1900s, this thing, the people were laying down railroad tracks.

461
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,560
 They would be bite marks, bite marks in a railroad track.

462
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,040
 So again, this thing is either the Mary Sue of cryptids, or it's getting exponentially

463
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
 stronger.

464
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,940
 Seen fish, then it's seen humans, and now it's eating railways.

465
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,380
 In 1943, there was a sewer worker named Jack Bannister, and he said one day he was walking

466
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
 down the street.

467
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,080
 I don't know if it was at night, I'm assuming so, because this would be quite bold to do

468
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,380
 during the day.

469
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,180
 The Crocodingo walks up.

470
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,020
 The Crocodingo, because he looks like a dingo, did I say that?

471
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,340
 I said he looked like a dog, but it's the same thing.

472
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,740
 And I think I've been calling him Crocodigator a lot too, so we'll see if I have to edit

473
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,860
 those out.

474
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,480
 The Crocodingo walks up to a manhole cover and using just its nose like a dog, push the

475
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,800
 manhole cover off.

476
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 That's not an old woman on All in the Family complaining.

477
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,240
 That's the metal scraping against the concrete, and he watched the Crocodingo jump into the

478
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
 sewer.

479
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,760
 And to this day, people say you can still hear the snarls and the growls deep within

480
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,400
 the sewer system underneath the city of Juanita.

481
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,420
 That's a local legend, but what's interesting is 90% of that information is only found in

482
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,540
 that mysterious universe article.

483
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,340
 I would find stuff about the Crocodingo and they'd be like, "Crocodingos, Tennessee,

484
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,020
 people who've seen it there."

485
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,140
 And all of that stuff was mostly after the mysterious universe article came out.

486
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,940
 Weird, right?

487
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,340
 Very detailed for what should be a pretty well-known local legend, because we have tons of information

488
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
 on GreenEyes.

489
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,320
 Like, Chattanooga Express did a write-up on it about how its societal impact and blah,

490
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
 blah, blah, blah.

491
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 GreenEyes is very, very well-known.

492
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,920
 Crocodingo is pretty obscure.

493
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,560
 Let's fly up to Virginia.

494
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,620
 Technically, nowadays, it's a West Virginia.

495
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,140
 But let's fly away from the Crocodingo.

496
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,280
 Let's fly away from, like, leaning out the window.

497
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,000
 I'm like, "I don't believe you saw the Northern Lights!"

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,160
 He's like, "Do you believe that I saw a monster?"

499
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
 I'm like, "Maybe!

500
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,120
 I don't know, but you didn't see the Northern Lights!"

501
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,100
 Fly away, the guy's like, "I don't know if I should shake my fist at him," which

502
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,820
 kind of shrugged because that guy doesn't believe how he--he doesn't believe the most

503
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,300
 basic part of the story.

504
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,420
 Oh, yeah, monsters.

505
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,700
 Yeah, I totally believe that.

506
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,300
 But what Northern Lights?

507
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,940
 We're flying up to Virginia.

508
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
 West Virginia, nowadays.

509
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
 Harper's Ferry.

510
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,260
 Now, this wasn't from the Civil War book.

511
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,100
 This was from a website called Phantoms and Monsters, an article by Lon Strickler.

512
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,500
 Private James Moore, 67th Infantry Regiment, Pennsylvania.

513
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,860
 He wrote a letter on February 26, 1863.

514
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,980
 This letter was found in, like, the '90s.

515
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,080
 Someone was going through--someone bought a bunch of stuff from an estate sale, was

516
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,720
 going through all these letters, and found these letters from a Civil War soldier.

517
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,780
 This letter, again, if we accept this story to be true, was decayed.

518
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,640
 Parts of it are missing, but this is what we have.

519
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,140
 Harper's Ferry, Virginia.

520
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,760
 These are going to be fragments, but I'll just read them as one whole thing.

521
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,600
 "Ramsey and myself were charged to guard company accruements along the railway.

522
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,260
 Very cold, still night.

523
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,540
 The boys started raising a ruckus from the garrison.

524
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,640
 Some were yelling aloud that a man beast was on foot.

525
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,040
 There was rifle fire towards the river.

526
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,900
 We continued our duty as the yelling and shots continued.

527
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,320
 The corporal queried the witnesses from the company.

528
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,360
 I was told that the devil raided the food stores after climbing the wall.

529
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,520
 It was covered in thick layers of dark hair.

530
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,200
 Maybe eight foot from head to toe."

531
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,620
 So there's basically Bigfoot breaking into an army base.

532
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,120
 That's a movie.

533
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
 That--not saying that.

534
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,080
 Let's assume that--sorry, someone needs to make a movie about that, right?

535
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,040
 Like Bigfoot, Civil War Bigfoot breaking into an army base.

536
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,840
 He's so hungry.

537
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,060
 They're just basically like the wars depleting all of his twigs and berries or whatever he

538
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,440
 eats.

539
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,960
 And then he's like, "Oh, there's a bunch of food in here."

540
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,680
 So it's like an ocean--Ocean's eight because he's eight feet tall.

541
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,200
 And he's like coming up with like plans.

542
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,760
 It's like him and a bunch of other Bigfoots.

543
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,120
 They're like in tuxes and stuff.

544
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,480
 And they can figure out--it's a heist movie.

545
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,280
 It's actually now it's a better movie.

546
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
 It's from the point of view of the Bigfoot.

547
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,480
 Originally I was imagining the soldiers like hunkered down to the fort and they hear like

548
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,720
 the roar in the forest.

549
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
 That would be a horror movie.

550
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,120
 Now this is going to be a heist movie with eight Bigfoots.

551
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,640
 They're all eight feet tall.

552
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,280
 And then they're trying to figure out how to break into Harper's Ferry.

553
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,920
 That would be dope.

554
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
 Make that movie, Hollywood.

555
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
 James Wan.

556
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,040
 I know you listen to this podcast, make that movie.

557
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,120
 So anyways, we have a story of Bigfoot.

558
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,080
 Now, that was from--that was from these letters and that was from that website Phantoms and

559
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,880
 Monsters, which I go to all the time.

560
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,840
 But I have another Bigfoot story from, again, that same Mysterious Universe article and

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,360
 the Mysterious Universe articles based on the book The Civil War of the Worlds.

562
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,800
 At the Battle of Chikamunga, again, honestly, we just had the green eyes here.

563
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,440
 So at the Battle of Chikamunga, they also had a sighting of a Bigfoot.

564
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,920
 Technically, a hearing.

565
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,480
 There were two Southerners soldiers.

566
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,920
 This is at the same time that the green eyes thing is going on.

567
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,640
 Two Southerners soldiers, Private Ott Morton and Private Billy Chandler.

568
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
 They're on guard duty.

569
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,760
 They're waiting for things to pop off and they're going to be real bad.

570
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,280
 Again, the second bloodiest battle of the war.

571
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,200
 They hear a horrible shriek in the woods, a horrible screaming.

572
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,360
 They go to check it because, again, they're guards.

573
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,840
 They got to go investigate that stuff, right?

574
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,000
 And they actually do see it.

575
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
 I said earlier that they just heard it.

576
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,680
 I forgot they do see it.

577
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,880
 They come around the bend.

578
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,720
 They look on the trees and they see something.

579
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,160
 It's 10 feet tall, which is big even for a Bigfoot.

580
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,880
 They have, quote, "Eyes like hot coals and breath like the smell of rotten meat."

581
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,520
 So again, and that's really typical in Bigfoot stories is the smell.

582
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
 That makes more sense.

583
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,600
 Like the rotten meat you figure has just been eating a bunch of stuff.

584
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,480
 If we don't brush our teeth, does our breath smell like rotten meat?

585
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
 Is it just smell?

586
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,480
 Like if I ate nothing but meat all day, which I do because I'm back on keto, but if I did

587
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,160
 that and then didn't brush my...

588
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,880
 I'm sorry, it's experiment.

589
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,040
 I'll have to figure this out.

590
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
 They run away.

591
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
 They go back.

592
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,080
 They tell the commanding officers, "There's a monster in the woods."

593
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,560
 You know, the commanding officers are getting ready for the Civil War.

594
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,680
 Like they're in full swing of killing each other.

595
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
 And they're like, "Great.

596
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,000
 These guys are saying there's a monster in the woods."

597
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,480
 They totally dismiss them, but the next day the two guys are still nuts.

598
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
 They're still cowering in the corner.

599
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,360
 So the commanding officer goes, "Oh, okay.

600
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
 So it's not a prank and they're not drunk.

601
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
 They're actually still terrified.

602
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
 Let's go out and check and they send someone else out there."

603
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,000
 They find footprints, 22 inches long footprints.

604
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 This is where the story gets weird.

605
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,560
 So we've talked about Bigfoot's and GreenEyes and ghosts whose cannonballs blew off their

606
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,240
 heads and the people in the South seem known what the Northern Lights look like in the

607
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,880
 1830s and Crocodingos.

608
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 We've talked about all of this weird stuff.

609
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,840
 Now as I'm researching this, I go, "That book sounds right up my alley.

610
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,600
 The Civil War of the Worlds, first hand accounts of UFOs and other mysterious phenomenon during

611
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,800
 America's Civil War.

612
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,200
 It sounds right up my alley."

613
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,720
 That book doesn't exist at all.

614
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,560
 According to my research, it never existed.

615
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,440
 Now I'm not saying Brent Swancer made it up.

616
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,400
 That would just be a weird thing as well, but no, it's even weirder than that.

617
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
 Edgar Riley.

618
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,120
 I think earlier I called him Edgar Wright.

619
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
 That's not correct.

620
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,080
 Like I said, this episode broke my brain.

621
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,200
 The director of Ant-Man did not write this book.

622
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,880
 Edgar Riley, the author who wrote this book that doesn't exist, doesn't exist.

623
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,480
 There is no Edgar Riley as an author.

624
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,840
 It doesn't exist.

625
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,400
 There is an Edgar Riley who fought during the Civil War.

626
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,800
 It's the only connection I could find.

627
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,040
 So you go, "Jason, you said Brent Swancer didn't make it up, but he's the one who's

628
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,960
 basing all of the stuff on this art."

629
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,560
 And I actually emailed Brent Swancer and I'll let you know what he says when he gets back

630
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
 to me.

631
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,360
 I said, "He did an article a while back on this book, but I can't find any proof that

632
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
 this book exists.

633
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,440
 I'm not accusing him of making it up because I found another, even more obscure website."

634
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,560
 Because Mysterious Universe is huge.

635
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,480
 I found another really obscure website that not only talks about this book that doesn't

636
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
 exist but has photographs from it.

637
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,600
 This is so bizarre.

638
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,360
 This was hurting my brain.

639
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,120
 I almost gave up researching it and said, "I'm going to do this as another episode."

640
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,840
 Because this was really messing with my head.

641
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,560
 I implore you guys to go to the show notes for this one because there's going to be a

642
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,240
 lot of photographs that I'll describe.

643
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
 Yeah, obviously.

644
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,360
 I'm not that much of a wordsmith.

645
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
 I'd recommend taking a look at these photographs.

646
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,720
 There's only two websites that talk about this book, The Civil War of the Worlds by Edgar

647
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
 Reilly.

648
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,160
 This book has never been, it's not on Goodreads, it's not on Amazon.

649
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
 Doesn't exist.

650
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,600
 But there's multiple quotes of it from the Mysterious Universe article.

651
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,360
 And again, if it wasn't Mysterious Universe, which they're a really good website, Brent

652
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,720
 Swancer, I've covered a ton of times on this show.

653
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,720
 I don't think he's anything up to anything no good.

654
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,960
 There's another website I would have think.

655
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,200
 They're just making it up.

656
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,400
 But I found this other website.

657
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,560
 It's called dugdobbs.com.

658
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,520
 It is a Civil War website.

659
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,680
 And they have a little aside.

660
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,000
 They only talk about Civil War.

661
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,560
 They have one article on it called The Civil War of the Worlds by a guy named Simon Cordwayner.

662
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,640
 And it says, "Posted here by permission of the author."

663
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,960
 So what it looks like is Simon Cordwayner wrote this article for somewhere else and then

664
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,560
 Doug Dobbs said, "Oh, that's really cool.

665
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
 I'm a Civil War website."

666
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,320
 Kind of put your article on my website and Simon says, "Yes."

667
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,960
 It's a review of this book, The Civil War of the Worlds.

668
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,640
 And in this book, we see a bunch of these photographs.

669
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,360
 We see a photograph of a bombed out city in the south.

670
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,080
 And there are four UFOs flying in the picture.

671
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,960
 Now, could be birds, could be artillery shells, could be a lot of different things.

672
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,880
 This book, this photo is from this book.

673
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,680
 Here's a little passage from this book here.

674
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:35,000
 The diary of Captain Marcus Twinney, a member of General Hooker's staff, includes an account

675
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,080
 of a, quote, "metallic object that hovered over the Rapa-Knock Riverbank for almost 10

676
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,440
 minutes in March of 1863."

677
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,640
 Members of the 10th New Jersey Calvary stopped to watch as it floated over a Union pontoon

678
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
 bridge.

679
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:55,520
 And then there's a photo of a Union pontoon bridge, a bunch of soldiers lined up, and

680
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,960
 a disc floating in the sky, a UFO.

681
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,080
 Now out of all the pictures, this looks the fakest.

682
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,560
 That UFO would have to be the Psy--I mean, that UFO would be massive.

683
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
 And it looks weird the way it's blurry.

684
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,920
 So that one--but it's in this book, and so is that story as well.

685
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,240
 There was an artist known as Nathan B. Mattington.

686
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
 Now again, I could not prove that this guy existed.

687
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,320
 This is where I really--it was really trying to mess with my head.

688
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,840
 So I'm like, what is going on?

689
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,200
 Really try to prove that this guy existed.

690
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,480
 Because at this point when I'm researching this, first I'm like, oh, Crocodingo, that'll

691
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
 be funny.

692
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 Oh, Green Eyes, that'll be funny.

693
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
 Oh, that book's looking interesting.

694
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,160
 And then I went down this rabbit hole.

695
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,120
 The book doesn't exist.

696
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,400
 The story of Green Eyes exists.

697
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,720
 And the Bigfoot story about him breaking into the camp.

698
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
 That's from another resource.

699
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,840
 But everything else we've talked about, the Crocodingo and the Bigfoot story with the

700
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,760
 two men on watch, and they see it.

701
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,440
 Both of those, as far as I can tell, only come from this book.

702
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,080
 And all this other stuff, the Pontoon Bridge and the UFO photo, this one's weird.

703
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,960
 Nathan Mattington was an artist for a newspaper called Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.

704
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,080
 During the Civil War, he was there and he was drawing pictures.

705
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,680
 There's a picture of a bunch of dead soldiers and a crop circle.

706
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,640
 And someone said that they actually found this way later.

707
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,720
 In 1994, Mattington's great-granddaughter was going through his possessions and found

708
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
 a scrapbook.

709
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,840
 And found this drawing, this sketch of a couple soldiers laying dead next to what appears

710
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,120
 to be a crop circle.

711
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,040
 Now as a skeptic, I'm thinking maybe they moved to Canon and they drew and it was like

712
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,080
 flattening the grass and all that stuff.

713
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,320
 But there's nothing else in this drawing except these guys lying in this crop circle.

714
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 And then this book, Civil War of the Worlds, goes on to talk about a poem written by a

715
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,680
 soldier named Lucius Dodd, who I could not find any proof that this guy existed.

716
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
 Right?

717
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
 Sounds like an old-timey name, but I can't.

718
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,120
 Apparently this guy, Lucius Dodd, wrote a poem called "Mark the Gravesite Boys."

719
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,600
 And now this sketch that Nathan Mattington did was in a place called the Wheatfield.

720
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,720
 This was at the Battle of Gettysburg.

721
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,920
 And Mark the Gravesite's boys talks about the Wheatfield.

722
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
 Here's the passage from that poem.

723
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,560
 "Amongst the circles of the Wheatfield, Yankee boys did fall.

724
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:34,240
 Ground lines point to rebel batteries, a hail of buck and ball."

725
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,040
 And the article is saying nobody really understood what that line meant.

726
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,960
 "Amongst the circles of the Wheatfield."

727
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,960
 Now it's possible that they- it- it- it means something.

728
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,760
 Again, as a skeptic, I'm- sometimes I'm grasping at straws or grasping at wheat.

729
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,880
 Could mean battlements that are made.

730
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,520
 And then when they moved the battlements just the rounds- but this thing looks like a crop

731
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
 circle.

732
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,640
 Also noted in this book, and I skip a lot of this stuff because I'm not a big fan of

733
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,040
 them, but the River Monsters.

734
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
 They had a couple of them.

735
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,360
 I talked about the Bassigator, but in this book, the Civil War thing, there you would

736
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,000
 have soldiers seeing these giant alligator like, "Why don't you tell us about the giant

737
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 alligator monsters?"

738
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,080
 I'm not a big fan of Lake Monsters.

739
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
 Giant alligator monsters attacking boats, attacking Confederate boats.

740
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,960
 You're like, "That's way more interesting than just a dude with that breath in the middle

741
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
 of the woods."

742
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,200
 Ah, hold on.

743
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,080
 Confederate boats going down the river and monsters knocking them over and stuff like

744
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
 that.

745
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
 Those were reported in this book.

746
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,800
 Chessie, the Chesapeake Bay version of Loch Ness Monster, is in this book to the point

747
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,640
 that there is a photograph of Chessie, the oldest photograph of a sea monster.

748
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,840
 It's a picture of Chesapeake Bay.

749
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,600
 And then you see a little, a too perfect picture of little Chessie head sticking out and you

750
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,480
 actually can see the body underneath.

751
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,800
 I'm assuming it's fake.

752
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,200
 And that's just because I don't like sea monsters.

753
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,000
 Anyways, I'm thanking at this point.

754
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Like I said, I emailed Brent Swancer and I'll see if I can get more information.

755
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 But I'm thinking at this point that maybe there is a review copy going around or something

756
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,800
 like that that the book was never released.

757
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,680
 But then when we get to the end of this Doug Dobbs article, which is basically a review

758
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,280
 of this book, which again, go and look at these photographs, we end this with this sentence

759
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
 here.

760
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,920
 "If you have an interest in civil war history, or if you are merely a fan of the strange

761
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,520
 and paranormal phenomenon, you will thoroughly enjoy the civil war of the worlds.

762
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,720
 First hand accounts of UFOs and other mysterious phenomenon during America's civil war."

763
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,760
 Riley, so this next sentence means that the person who wrote this article is in communication

764
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,120
 with the author.

765
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,080
 So even if they did get a review copy, this person has talked to the author.

766
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,760
 Riley plans on releasing a second volume near the end of this year.

767
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,200
 And I will anxiously be awaiting its release.

768
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,160
 Now we don't know what year this was written in.

769
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,640
 Mysterious Universe's article came out in 2016.

770
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,440
 So we can assume this was written probably 2015, 2016, 2017.

771
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,760
 But this book does not exist.

772
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,800
 This author does not exist.

773
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,040
 Even though people have looked, it appears to have read the book and people have been

774
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
 in communication with this author.

775
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,280
 There's one of a few scenarios going on.

776
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,960
 One that I'm really bad at at Google.

777
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,600
 And you can find this copy like that.

778
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,400
 It's at 10 used bookstores within 20 miles of myself.

779
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
 I could order it on Amazon right now.

780
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,480
 That's scenario one.

781
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,000
 And I'm totally just too paranoid.

782
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,400
 Scenario number two is this was a marketing gimmick for some virtual movie coming out

783
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,800
 and Doug Dobbs got taken into it and Britt Swancer got taken in by it, which happens to

784
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
 the best of it.

785
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,120
 I've got taken in by it.

786
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,080
 The Lone Pine Devils, they did an episode on.

787
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,440
 Turns out it was a viral marketing for a YouTube movie.

788
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
 It happens.

789
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,160
 It happens to the best of us.

790
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,000
 Could be that these were copies or notes going out.

791
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 The book was never finished.

792
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,520
 Edgar Riley was looking for a publisher to build hype.

793
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,840
 But what's weird about that scenario, everyone getting scammed and it being a hoax, that's

794
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
 more believable than this one.

795
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,320
 Because then you would have to assume that Edgar Riley, an author who has enough push

796
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,720
 to get this stuff published, has no other stuff written, no personal stuff of his own.

797
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,120
 The name Edgar Riley connected to the Civil War does not exist.

798
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,640
 I'm sure there are people out there named Edgar Riley.

799
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,240
 Right now if your name is Edgar Riley don't be like "I don't exist, oh no, you exist."

800
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,360
 But then the paranoid person in me, right?

801
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,880
 Just what you guys are all waiting for.

802
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,800
 You're like "Why is this so weird to you?"

803
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,720
 I think this book came out and I think it got suppressed.

804
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:55,920
 I think this book came out and it was so explosive that it got shut down, not only shut down,

805
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,160
 but deleted.

806
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,160
 It's gone.

807
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
 Now I'm going to look like an idiot.

808
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,440
 Again, if someone's like "No, you dude, you're just bad at Google, here's 100 copies of it."

809
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,160
 I think it's been suppressed.

810
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,000
 I think it existed at one point.

811
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,040
 Now it's possible that it came out, it didn't do well at all, it had a first print of a

812
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,400
 thousand copies, it was a vanity pressed book and it just disappeared.

813
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,600
 That's totally possible.

814
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,240
 You still think it would pop up on Goodreads or Amazon or any place that he had a digital

815
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
 footprint.

816
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,320
 If this book was from the 1980s, yeah, sure, I would totally agree that this is old.

817
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,320
 Doug Dobbs article, like the website that this is on, June 17th, 2013 was the last time

818
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
 it was edited.

819
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,600
 Now we are going far back enough that this author may not have a digital trail, but what's

820
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,320
 still weird about that is that Mysterious Universe article is talking about stuff, is quoting

821
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,920
 stuff, has the Chesapeake Bay photograph as well published February 3rd, 2016, so I still

822
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,440
 think a copy of this book should have been floating around between 2013 and 2016.

823
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,200
 But this book has been scrubbed, this author has been scrubbed.

824
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,400
 This book as far as any book database that I could look at does not exist.

825
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,440
 So then you start to ask questions, who has the power to do something like that?

826
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,880
 Now obviously time does, time and negligence.

827
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,840
 If the book only had a hundred copies, then he sent them all out and it never gained traction

828
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,960
 and he never set up an email or a webpage for it or anything like that.

829
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,720
 But even in 2013, authors were kind of doing that thing.

830
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,760
 But that's possible, right?

831
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
 That is just time has wiped it clean.

832
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,320
 But then you start to look at who would want to cover stuff like this up and then we start

833
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,920
 to look at stuff like the boogeymen of conspiracy theories, the government.

834
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,000
 What could be so explosive in a book about monsters and ghouls and UFOs running around

835
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 during the Civil War times that would make someone want to delete the book?

836
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,480
 I mean, if the government had a problem with Bigfoot stuff, there's Bigfoot shows like

837
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,480
 on cable television.

838
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,160
 You know, same thing with UFO shows, all that stuff.

839
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,200
 Who would have the biggest problem with UFO sightings and monster sightings during the

840
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,080
 Civil War?

841
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,200
 Who would have not only have a problem with that information gaining out, but have the

842
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,200
 ability to cover it up?

843
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,600
 Time Traveller, right?

844
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,080
 Time Travellers.

845
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,960
 The Civil War shaped American history and America shaped the world.

846
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,520
 A thousand different things could have gone wrong every single day during that time period.

847
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:42,080
 It was extremely important for where we're at today for the Union to win that war and

848
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,960
 for the Union to win that war in the way they won that war.

849
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,280
 I think the Civil War is one of those major world events.

850
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,120
 Every single day, actions were being taken and mistakes were being made that could have

851
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,680
 changed the scope of human history.

852
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,920
 If the Civil War had gone another way and the Union had not won the Civil War, you would

853
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,280
 not have had a United States.

854
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,200
 You would have had two countries that would have almost constantly been at warfare.

855
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,800
 Who would have entered in to help out the Allies during World War I?

856
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,760
 Who definitely, there would have been no Allies or there would have been no American force

857
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,720
 during World War II.

858
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,880
 You can send all the Time Travellers back you want to fight to kill Hitler, but the

859
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,480
 fact of the matter is there was no America in that case.

860
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
 I'm not saying America is the greatest country in the world.

861
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
 They were pretty cool.

862
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:41,160
 But what I'm saying is that like us or hate us, we were pretty instrumental for some massive

863
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,440
 changes in the globe.

864
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,000
 What if Time Travellers are going back in time and erasing any mention of this book?

865
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,480
 Because in this book, again these are all just little snippets from this book, but in

866
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,560
 this book itself may be a clue of Time Travellers interfering in human history.

867
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,320
 A real clue.

868
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,240
 A clue that could not be abided.

869
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,840
 So the little mentions of the monster standing over the body or the Bigfoot or the Green

870
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:20,200
 Eyes, which actually again is one of the stories that is not only in the book, exists

871
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,400
 elsewhere.

872
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,360
 In this book there was information that was too dangerous for people to know.

873
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:34,420
 And not only could that information not be known, but there could be no chance that information

874
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,600
 could get out outside of that book.

875
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,980
 So the book was erased.

876
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,160
 The author was erased.

877
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,640
 Now the knowledge that those things existed still exists, but we can never check on it.

878
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,880
 We can never go get that book and look for it and go to chapter 4 and turn the page and

879
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,320
 read a story that just is too true.

880
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,920
 Is that the case?

881
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,640
 Or is it simply a book of millions of books that get published?

882
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,780
 This book simply fizzled out, the author went back to doing woodworking, let his private

883
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:19,120
 website go under, and is doing things and living his life.

884
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,480
 That's possible and that's honestly the most likely scenario.

885
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:33,480
 However, it's possible as well, as minutely possible, that the book was scrubbed.

886
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,120
 And scrubbed for our own good.

887
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:49,760
 Because sometimes too much of the truth, like too much of a smell, can lead a man to insanity.
