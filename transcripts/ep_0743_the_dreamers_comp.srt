1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
 The Red Rooms. Supposedly on the deep web, there are websites where you can pay money

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:14,580
 to watch people get murdered live. This has always been considered an urban legend until

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,420
 the Italian police investigated one.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:24,140
 Now we take a look at the podcast Dead Rabbit Radio. After so many episodes, conspiracy

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:31,580
 theories are starting to pop up. Why does this podcast exist? What is its end goal? And the

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,060
 answer may lie in your dreams. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,560
 [Music]

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,660
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,460
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,420
 you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend doing whatever you love doing. We got a ton

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,540
 of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away. First off, walking into Dead Rabbit

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,740
 Man. It's one of our legacy Patreon supporters. You know his name. You say his name. It's

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,660
 Robert Paulson. Everyone give a round of applause to Robert Paulson. He's walking in. Robert,

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,540
 you're gonna be our captain, our pilot. He actually did some fan art for us as well. You

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,700
 know what? Actually, let's do that. For Fan Art Friday, let's use his fan art that he

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,740
 made. He did this. We really, really appreciate it. And then he started supporting the Patreon.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,900
 So Robert, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. And look at this dope

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,980
 fan art. It's the Ouija board. The Ouija board, Dead Rabbit Radio logo. Looks great. True

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,220
 classic. Really, really appreciate the work, Robert. And Robert is a Patreon supporter

20
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,060
 as well. So you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,900
 the Patreon, that's fine too. I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,940
 Write reviews about it. Talk to your friends about it. Talk to your family about it. Post

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,820
 flyers. We have flyers in the show notes. If you can't help the show financially, that

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,060
 is another great way you can help the show and keep the show going. Robert Paulson,

25
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,420
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the shovel. Let's go ahead and take the carpenter caboose.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,060
 We're taking this choo-choo train all the way from Dead Rabbit Command out to Italy.

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,780
 Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo. Robert Paulson's one little conductor outfit.

28
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,980
 He didn't even know he'd be riding the caboose. It's just his favorite clothes. Robert is

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,740
 bringing us out in this train underwater tunnel all the way out to Italy. There's just really

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,660
 interesting story that's happened in Italy recently. But before we start talking about

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,420
 that, let's back up a bit. So the red rooms. I've talked about them on the podcast. I

32
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,780
 don't think I did a proper episode on them. They're on the Conspiracy Theory Iceberg and

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,940
 this is what it is. We're sitting in Italy and we're in a cyber cafe. If those still

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,940
 exist and I'm like, "Hey, distract the barista and then you go give me some coffee because

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,420
 I'm thirsty." And then you watch the door because we're gonna use this public... I don't

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,220
 know why we're just not doing this in the hotel room. I don't want to use my laptop.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:01,540
 We're going onto the dark web. And supposedly, like again, this was an urban legend. There's

38
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,940
 been a lot of debate over whether or not these exist. There's been a lot of debate over whether

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,580
 or not snuff films exist. Now snuff film, I'm sure you guys are aware of it. I'm sure

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,780
 you guys have an extensive collection of it. A snuff film, specifically, it's the murder

41
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,660
 of someone on camera, but it has to be made for commercial purposes. There's tons and

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,940
 tons of footage of people being killed. Snuff films have a distinction. This is the way

43
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,580
 law enforcement looks at it. It has to be made. The main goal of it is not as a warning

44
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,620
 to rival cartels. It's not to scare people. It may have those as secondary goals, but

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,820
 the main goal is this is commercially produced. It doesn't have to have a $60 million budget,

46
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,820
 but the main goal behind it must be to make money off of the footage. Commercially produced

47
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,980
 product. That's what makes it a snuff film. Unfortunately, there's gore videos everywhere,

48
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,460
 but for it to be a snuff film, when they sat down and they go, "We're gonna murder some

49
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,220
 people today, and we're doing it and we're gonna record it on camera for the purpose

50
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,940
 of making money off the production of the footage." The FBI has long said there is no

51
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:17,660
 such thing as snuff films. That is what the snuff film is. A red room is even more mythical,

52
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,500
 because a red room requires it not only to be commercially made, you still have to have

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,060
 that thing. A red room is not watching gore videos online. It has to be for commercial

54
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:40,060
 purposes and it's live. It's live footage. So again, a gore death in a red room does

55
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,340
 not count as a red room video. The red room has to be made for commercial purposes and

56
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,500
 you can watch it live. Whether or not you're walking, you would have not woken up in time,

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,780
 but people were able to watch it live. That's what the definition of a red room video is.

58
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,220
 I'm sure if the room is mauve or red or purple, it doesn't matter, but the idea is some people

59
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,420
 could watch it live over the internet. Now, the sticking point to this was that the dark web

60
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,180
 is really, really slow. You're using the Tor browser to get there. It's super slow. People think

61
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,500
 it has a ton of security. It doesn't. They'll find you. They're constantly busting people on the

62
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,180
 dark web. I'm surprised that it still has this reputation of being top secret. But you can't

63
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:35,740
 stream live video on the dark web. The internet speeds weren't fast enough. Well, that's,

64
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,540
 I'm using the past tense now. When I did an episode, when I talked about the red rooms,

65
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,020
 again on the conspiracy theory iceberg, I talked about it maybe the first year of the podcast,

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,820
 that was considered the feds go, listen, there's, it's a myth because you can't stream live video

67
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,580
 footage over the dark web. It's way too slow. It would be unfeasible to do it.

68
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,860
 But like all technology, it marches forward. And now people are saying, well,

69
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,740
 they could have gotten better, they could have gotten better broadband, could have gotten better

70
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:18,300
 ethernet cables where this stuff is supposedly taking place. Because in 2019 in Italy, Operation

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:28,060
 delirio took place. The Italian police force in one swoop arrested 25 suspects spread across 13

72
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,460
 provinces. And they were able to target these people because they were the worst of the worst,

73
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,580
 what these people were searching for, finding and hosting on their computers was beyond anything

74
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,740
 that these officers were prepared for. And the suspects were shocking as well. Out of these 25

75
00:06:49,740 --> 00:07:00,620
 suspects, you had six adults, the other 19 were minors. I think the youngest was around 12,

76
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:08,460
 13 years old, and then the oldest was 17. And this all came out because a concerned parent

77
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:15,900
 went through her son's or 15 year old son's phone and saw illegal content on it. And illegal content

78
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,940
 meaning this 15 year old had child porn on their phone. So the parent contacted the police because

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,580
 what else are you going to do at that point? Parent, it's a little late for intervention.

80
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,740
 You got to get law enforcement involved. The parents contact the police and the police

81
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,900
 started interrogating him. And they begin to talk to this kid and find out who he's sharing

82
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,500
 these videos with, who he's sharing these photos with. And that is when this kid tells them some

83
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 of these videos we watched live. The investigators are what? And he goes, what videos are you talking

84
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,020
 about? And this kid, this 15 year old kid, now you can say the word of a 15 year old kid in a

85
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:00,700
 police station is probably shaky. But he's now going to be admitting to something morally worse,

86
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,980
 I would argue, than child porn. Because what they're watching in these dark web videos is the

87
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:13,020
 torture and murder of children in these red rooms. And he goes, we paid money on the dark web and they

88
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,540
 showed the police officers these sites where we pay money and they take these kids from third world

89
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,620
 countries. They take them in this room and they torture them and they murder them. And we get

90
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,020
 to pay if you have enough money, because I don't know if these kids are funneling their allowance

91
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,060
 into this thing, but if you have enough money, you can choose what happens to the kids.

92
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:45,500
 Now I'm not going to go into the gory details of what actually was going. I'm sure you can use

93
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,900
 your imagination. You're probably pretty irritated that you have to use your imagination

94
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,100
 in the first place. That he goes, people would choose this and people would choose that and

95
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,740
 then we would see that acted out on camera. And the police are able to sweep up all these other

96
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,380
 suspects and they don't know what to do. I mean, obviously, I think, you know, the child porn,

97
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,860
 that's illegal, they're going to be charged with that. Would they be charged with accessories to

98
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,780
 murder if they're doing this thing? Now there are red room scams out there too, where you donate

99
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,020
 your Bitcoin and you don't get anything, which if you're going to scam anyone, scam people who

100
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,380
 want to watch red rooms, I have no problem with that. But that wasn't the case. They had these

101
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,180
 videos on their phone. They had this stuff on their phone. And the police just like, how do you

102
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,820
 prosecute that? I don't think it's illegal to own snuff. It's obviously, because legally it doesn't

103
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:51,100
 exist. But now the Italian police are saying, well, it does. This stuff was made for commercial intent.

104
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,820
 And it was made on the dark web. It's what we always feared. Because even though the law enforcement

105
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,860
 said snuff films don't exist, it's one of those things that it feels like they do. It doesn't

106
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,580
 feel like they should. I'm not saying that they should exist, but doesn't it when people, I remember

107
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,900
 when you first heard about snuff films, they were terrifying. People getting killed on camera,

108
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,260
 on purpose. And then I remember reading that they weren't real by the FBI. They released this

109
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,100
 document. It was like back in the 80s, because they used to be a bigger thing, the fear of snuff

110
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,860
 movies. But when you hear the FBI, when you hear a law enforcement talk about it, you go, yeah,

111
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,540
 that makes sense. But it feels like they're real. It's one of those things that would not shock me

112
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,420
 if it turns out that they were real in the FBI, botched their investigation, or they were covering

113
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,020
 something up because they're weirdos. I don't know. I'm not saying the FBI loves their snuff, but

114
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,700
 when they came out and they denied it, which they could be right. They could have been right at that

115
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:57,580
 time. There were no murders shot specifically for commercial gain. But nowadays, where you can

116
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,420
 take Bitcoin, and you can do this stuff online, and as streaming gets better and better and better,

117
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,900
 unfortunately getting better in this case. I could see people doing this, and they're going,

118
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:17,580
 they're, these children were mostly from Southeast Asian countries. So it's an interesting true

119
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,100
 crime story. It's absolutely terrifying. And right now, like you see, because all of these kids are

120
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,620
 minors, we have no names. And this happened in 2019. I was looking at the story again. There hasn't

121
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,540
 been a lot of movement on it, at least not that's been reported. So who knows if they're still

122
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,220
 investigating it. These kids are still facing trial. But as far as I can tell, they haven't

123
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,180
 had their trial yet, 2019. And then we rolled into coronavirus. And now I've officially said

124
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:50,380
 enough keywords to get this episode blocked on Spotify. But as of right now, they're just in,

125
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:59,340
 I'm assuming, I hopefully in jail. But it appears that the internet myth is true, that red rooms do

126
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,060
 exist. And it's one of those things that even though I covered it before and said technologically,

127
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:10,300
 it couldn't exist in the back of our heads, our collective head. We all have one. You're thinking,

128
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:18,460
 yeah, but unfortunately, it wouldn't make sense if they did. And this operation delirio seems to

129
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:28,060
 have proved something we all kind of believed was possible all along. Roger, Roger, Roger,

130
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,860
 Paulson, Roger, Paulson, we are leaving behind Italy. Jason, what is your voice sounds so bad?

131
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,140
 Well, because now this is my official carpenter copter headset is my eyeshift from side to side.

132
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,980
 It's not that I'm making an edit. And I'm not at home. It's not that I can't clean up my mistake.

133
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,220
 I'm wearing this headset officially to let Robert Paulson know we are leaving behind Italy,

134
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,340
 hop on board this carpenter copter young man, giving you the keys. We are headed out to

135
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:07,820
 your bedroom. This last topic is really kind of out there. I mean, it is taking place in your

136
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,060
 bedroom. We know what a freak you are. This is a really bizarre spin on this show.

137
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:21,820
 Because we've talked a lot about hyper sigils on this show, and how I use the law of attraction

138
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,540
 to draw audiences to the show. I think you have to visualize success and know you're already

139
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,180
 successful for you to be successful. And you have to do hard work. We've talked about that a lot on

140
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:45,900
 this show. But at what point does the show itself become a hyper sigil? Now this show is, I produce

141
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,380
 all this content, I edit it, I research it, I present it. That's it. There's no team on my side.

142
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,260
 There's people I talk to from time to time about topics I may or may not do. I talk to the

143
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,980
 patreons during the live show about it as well. But as far as the actual construction of the show,

144
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,820
 it's just me. There's no other editor, there's no writer, there's no researcher, there's nothing,

145
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:17,020
 it's just me. And this show, it's funny to think about it, has no competitors. As far as what this

146
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:27,980
 show is, it exists in its own space. The closest that comes to it is Coast to Coast AM, where it's

147
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,460
 a daily show about paranormal topics. There's, the Ghost Hunters have a daily show, but they mostly

148
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,700
 just talk about ghosts. They have a daily podcast as well. But we came into the game three years ago,

149
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,780
 and we have more episodes, and I'm not bragging, this is kind of setting this up. We came in three

150
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,020
 years ago, and we already have more episodes than last podcast on the left. We have more episodes

151
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,180
 than Mysterious Universe, which has been in production since 2006. Their episodes are longer.

152
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,620
 Their episodes are longer, but they cover less stories. A general episode of Mysterious Universe

153
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,500
 might cover one or two stories, maybe three on the bonus. Last podcast on the left usually covers

154
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,820
 one story mostly. And sometimes they'll have four episodes that cover a story. Now, both of those

155
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,700
 podcasts are more in depth with their stories. I like to sum it up, give you the information,

156
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,140
 just get it done in 15, 20 minutes. But different strokes for different folks, and both of those

157
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,660
 podcasts are great, and I understand why they're, I understand definitely why they're far more

158
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,900
 popular than this show. 100%, and they're really good at what they do, and the hat's off to them.

159
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,500
 But when you have one person focusing, I spend about 20, 25 hours a week on this show.

160
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:54,300
 After we're on episode what, like 740 something, that energy, it's so hyper focused.

161
00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:05,020
 Where is it going? And more importantly, what's it doing to the fabric of reality?

162
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:20,620
 Let's say 740 episodes, let's say average two stories in episode, that's 400, that's 1480 stories.

163
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:31,180
 I've been getting weird emails lately. This isn't a bit. I've been getting weird emails and weird

164
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,820
 YouTube comments lately from you guys. A while back I got a YouTube comment from Nikolai Mishkin,

165
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,660
 and they asked me a question, they go, "Hey, where's that season trailer you uploaded a while back?

166
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,060
 That was one of the best videos I've ever seen anywhere. Was it here or Instagram?"

167
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,700
 Now I did a season trailer once. I did a season trailer a long time ago, like between seasons

168
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,020
 three and four, four and five, something like that. And I didn't know what he was talking about,

169
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,900
 because it definitely wasn't the best video that anyone had ever seen. It wasn't a video either.

170
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,340
 I think I was posting stuff on YouTube at the time, I'm sure I was, but no video.

171
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,300
 So I asked him about it, what are you talking about, dude? Now Nikolai is one of those guys who

172
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,300
 came on late to the show. He's only been listening for the past couple months, but he's listened to

173
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,260
 every episode. And he goes, "There was this short video you released a while back. It was a trailer

174
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,060
 for Dead Rabbit Radio, and it was me playing Fortnite. It was about four minutes long, and I was doing

175
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:38,380
 Mungo's voice, who was a reoccurring character back in the day. And I said, one of the lines he

176
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,100
 thought was funny was, "But can he get the girl?" And I was cracking these jokes and doing this

177
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,180
 Mungo voice. And the song "Bella Royale," which is the Indian credit song, is playing in the background.

178
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:55,420
 He goes, "I want to watch that video again. It's so funny." That video doesn't exist. I never made

179
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:01,660
 anything like that. I don't have the technological know-how. And I've tried to stream video while

180
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,460
 doing anything. Like, video games, I mean. Video games. I've never been able to do that

181
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,660
 in any sort of overlay, ODP or whatever that program. OPD. It doesn't matter. I can't use it.

182
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,860
 It doesn't exist. And I told him, "I go do it. That video doesn't exist. It was the best video

183
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,500
 you've ever seen." And he goes, "Oh, maybe I was dreaming." A long-time listener of the show,

184
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,660
 Patreon supporter Tressa, put out a call for an episode. She emailed me, and she goes, "Hey,

185
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,980
 I'm looking for this specific episode you did." It's about an author, maybe a professor, who wrote

186
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:43,340
 about the fey. And then he disappeared. But before he did, he said that if he ever disappeared,

187
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,180
 he would have a sign at his funeral to prove that he wasn't dead, but trapped in the fey dimension,

188
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,060
 like fairies. Do you know what episode this is? Do you even know what I'm talking about?

189
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:03,020
 Now, that episode did ring a bit of a bell, but I couldn't find it. And when I posted it on the

190
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,500
 Patreon, they had no idea what she was talking about either. She also came to the conclusion

191
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:18,060
 that she must have just had a dream. Then I got this email from Sean, a long-time listener of the

192
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:27,580
 show. And he said he had this dream. He knew this was a dream from the outset. He was dreaming this.

193
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,300
 "I was in my childhood bedroom listening to the show, and he started talking about a homicide

194
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,740
 investigation you helped the police with. You said that when you were in college, you found the

195
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,980
 horribly charred corpse of a child in a park near Drexel University in Philadelphia. And he took

196
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:49,580
 a few Polaroid photos and handed them over to the police as evidence. But you kept one photo,

197
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,660
 because you're into the macabre true crime stuff. You also said the crime was never solved."

198
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,420
 Up until this point, you had been telling the story in your usual tone when discussing a serious

199
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,980
 matter. But then, and I swear, in the dream I felt the hair on my neck standing up because it was

200
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,260
 such a scary change. You became extremely distraught. As though you were breaking down and fighting

201
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,940
 back tears, and said that all evidence of the case had disappeared. You said how there was

202
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,020
 absolutely no mention of the crime on the Philadelphia Police Department website,

203
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,020
 that all articles about it had been totally wiped from the internet. And your one photo of the body

204
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,620
 is the only proof that the child ever existed. But you didn't sound like you were alleging a

205
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:43,660
 conspiracy to erase the crime. It was very sinister like you thought you were going crazy.

206
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:53,180
 It sounded horribly real, and I woke up in a cold sweat, shivering in relief that it was over.

207
00:20:53,180 --> 00:21:05,660
 I'm not the only one putting out this podcast. When I say it has no contemporaries,

208
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,740
 it's more media put out than anyone else. It's a daily show that's put out by a single person on

209
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:24,700
 these topics. I'm not the only one. I'm the only one here in this reality. But I'm not the only one.

210
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:33,420
 There have to be other jasons in other realities. Some of them never started the podcast. Some of

211
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,300
 them went on to do other things. Some of them did nothing and continued to dream about being creative

212
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:49,180
 while watching the creations of others all night long, not creating myself. But there are other

213
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:56,860
 jasons out there who did start the podcast. And all of this energy that I'm putting out,

214
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:07,500
 what if Conspiracy Caps fully on that these episodes, these incidents are real

215
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,020
 in alternate universes?

216
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:24,780
 I even had that incident where I reported a story about the Zennetti train company

217
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:31,020
 that went back in time. And in that episode, I said, "I know I've recorded this segment before.

218
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,060
 I know we've done this story." And I half expected to get a bunch of emails saying,

219
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,580
 "Dude, you did do it. You just kind of find the episode. It was episode 352 or whatever."

220
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,420
 As I'm telling the story, it sounded so familiar to me that I already recorded it and everything

221
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,180
 had been done that what if I did cover it in another universe?

222
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:01,660
 At what point does an artistic project stop being just an artistic project and become a

223
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:15,660
 hyper-sigil, become something else? I'm not telling stories. It is the story. The podcast is

224
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,300
 the conspiracy. The podcast is the paranormal event.

225
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,100
 And I'm doing it and this Jason is doing it and that Jason is doing it and that Jason is doing it.

226
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,620
 And because it's just one person behind the mic focusing so much of their energy and so much

227
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:40,220
 of their time, it's criss-crossing realities. When you have a team doing it, I'm not knocking

228
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,860
 teams. When you have a team of 10, 15 people putting together a podcast, that's awesome.

229
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,180
 But that mental energy is then diluted against 10 or 15 people. I have to do all the marketing

230
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,900
 all the way to the editing. I do everything and I'm so, so grateful that you are here to listen

231
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,700
 to this. I'm not diminishing your purpose in the podcast either.

232
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:09,820
 But when one person, I spend so much of my time thinking about the show, producing the show,

233
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,300
 restructuring the show, looking for ways to make it better, finding other things to

234
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:23,260
 market it with, promote it with. Are we punching holes through realities and connecting with other

235
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:30,380
 podcasts performed by other Jason's and we're starting to get the streams crossed?

236
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,460
 At what point does it stop being a podcast and start to become a portal?

237
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:45,900
 I expect, after doing this segment, that others of you have had dreams like this.

238
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,660
 But you just didn't, you were like, "Well, that was a weird dream."

239
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,580
 I suspect I'm going to get a few more emails or a few more YouTube comments. People are going like,

240
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,060
 "Dude, that is so weird because I've had the same sensation. I swore up and down I heard you cover

241
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:09,020
 a certain topic." And maybe I did. Maybe you just heard another version of me tell it.

242
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:17,900
 And at this point, where 740 some-odd episodes in, we're not even close to stopping,

243
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:26,780
 not even close, the hyper-sigil will continue to grow in power. And I don't see it as a negative

244
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,980
 thing. I'm not worried about it. I'm not concerned about it. I'm curious to see where this goes.

245
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:43,100
 As the dead rabbit radio hyper-sigil continues to grow, we may have a new Mandela effect happening.

246
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:51,980
 We may see realities collide in a way we can never expect. And if that happens,

247
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,140
 you know the first podcast that's going to cover it.

248
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:03,340
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also

249
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,220
 hit us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. TikTok is @DeadRabbitRadio.

250
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,220
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. You don't

251
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:22,540
 have to listen to it every day. I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great weekend, guys.

252
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:32,380
