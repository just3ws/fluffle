1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 Today we take a look at two dueling cases of insanity.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,640
 First off, what would you do if you were kicking back and joining a Nickelodeon cartoon,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,960
 and the next thing you knew, you were a raving lunatic?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,440
 And then we take a look at another form of insanity.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,960
 One that led a man to build a nation today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:35,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,800
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, hope you guys are having lots of fun.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,680
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,720
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so first off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, dressed

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,600
 up like royalty.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 Everyone bow to ya boy Roma.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,200
 Give a round of applause to ya boy Roma.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,240
 He's walking in dressed up as Burger King, the Burger King guy, right?

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 He's walking in, he's like, "What?

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 I didn't agree to this."

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,680
 Yes, yes you did.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,600
 When you ever join the Patreon, you may be used in an ad for Burger King.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
 So your boy Ryoma is walking in, he's like, "Dude, could you at least pronounce my name

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 right?"

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,040
 You're making me dress up like Burger King.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
 I'm a vegetarian, I don't know if he's a vegetarian.

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,680
 But anyways, you're dressed up as the Burger King and you're going to be our captain, our

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
 pilot this episode.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,040
 Whether we're flying to Burger King to get a Whopper, a Whopper Jr. or a BK Broiler,

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
 I know ya boy Ryoma.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,680
 It gets worse every single time we pronounce it.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,960
 I know ya boy will take us there.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
 Maybe you want a milkshake.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
 Do they have milkshakes at Burger King?

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,800
 I'm sure they do and I'm sure they're delicious.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 So ya boy Ryoma, go ahead and, I kind of got lost here.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,360
 I'm so busy thinking about how great Burger King is.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
 Oh, this is what I was supposed to say.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,160
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,280
 Just please go to your local Burger King and buy yourself a meal.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
 It's delicious.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,800
 They got the fries, they got sodas, they got sodas right?

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 Drink a soda.

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
 Drink a Burger King drink today.

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,600
 That is another way you can help support dead rabbit radio.

43
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,000
 Ya boy Ryoma, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to our new vehicle.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
 It's the BK Broiler Bicycle.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,600
 The wheels are just big chunks of meat.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 Or I don't know, the broiler might be a chicken.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,000
 Not one of the seats made out of a chicken patty.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
 It's super hot to sit on but get on board.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
 It's freshly grilled.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,120
 It's a charred broiled chicken patty in the shape of a seat.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,360
 We're like, "Ahhh, you're like chasing, is this bit?

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,520
 Is this bit going anywhere?

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,960
 Just get on the bicycle guys.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,160
 Just get on the BK Broiler Bicycle."

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,080
 Ya boy Ryoma is taking us out from Dead Rabbit Command.

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,480
 It's festooned with Burger King stuff everywhere.

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,080
 We are headed all the way out to some dude's living room.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,600
 [Mimics a chicken noises]

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
 That's the noise the BK Broiler Bicycle makes.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,840
 We need to oil the wheels of this BK Broiler Bicycle.

61
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,880
 But ya boy gets us there.

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,600
 We're at some dude's house.

63
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 I found this online.

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,520
 It was written by Goblin Witch 95.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,800
 We're going to call this dude Terry.

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 It's 2014.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
 We're at Terry's house.

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,600
 He's kicking back and he's watching the Fairly Odd Parents.

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,080
 A popular Nickelodeon show about the two flying people, Cosmo and Spandex.

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,280
 And then there's like Timmy is the kid and the Grant wishes.

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,600
 And this kind of just goes on and on and on for eight or nine or thirteen seasons.

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,200
 This guy's watching the Fairly Odd Parents and he's sitting there and then all of a sudden

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
 he's like, "Ugh.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,920
 I had some Burger King to eat.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 I'm so hungry."

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
 But then he thinks, "Wait a second.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,520
 Mark Jason launches into another ad for Burger King.

78
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,600
 Gotta have it your way."

79
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 He's sitting there.

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,320
 He's watching the Fairly Odd Parents.

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,000
 And he goes, "Wait a second.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
 I've seen this episode before."

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,640
 Now not in the sense of a repeat, but I'm having deja vu right now.

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,520
 Like I remember sitting on the couch right now watching this episode.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,640
 His sister's sitting there too and he's like, "Oh my, ugh.

86
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,440
 I remember like sitting next to my sister.

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
 I remember watching this show."

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,640
 Now deja vu is one of the same.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,240
 It's super unsettling when it happens.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,640
 I get it occasionally.

91
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,720
 And it's just a weird feeling because it honestly feels like you've relived that exact same

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 moment again.

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,920
 Even the air pressure feels the same.

94
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,240
 Stuff that you couldn't even replicate feels the same.

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,720
 And a lot of people say it's just basically your brain is like hitting a bump and it's

96
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,840
 like a little record scratch.

97
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,920
 You're not actually reliving the events.

98
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
 Your brain's just making you think you live the events.

99
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,160
 And this is what Terry's going through right now.

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,320
 He's like, "I remember this.

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 I remember this.

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,120
 I remember I did all this stuff anyways."

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,840
 But the feeling doesn't go away.

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,520
 Each passing minute it gets stronger and stronger and the jokes keep coming on that show.

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
 And he's like, "I already remember Cosmo's going to say this and then that other girl

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 is going to do this."

107
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,480
 And he can't get a grip.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,560
 The deja vu will not go away.

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,800
 And Terry realizes this is what it's like to lose your mind.

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,920
 And you go, "Jason, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're telling me that this kid just had a little

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,320
 bit of deja vu?"

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
 He thinks he's going insane.

113
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,600
 He feels like he's trapped in a mental loop.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,280
 This has happened before.

115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,000
 His brain is going haywire and he gets up and he starts panicking.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,080
 He starts pacing around the living room and he feels like, "This is it.

117
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,200
 I've lost my mind."

118
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,960
 And then a thought pops in his head, cutting through all the noise and the panic.

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,200
 Quote, "I would rather be dead than get put into a psych ward."

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,960
 He starts having visions of himself killing himself.

121
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,880
 He starts to have visions of killing himself.

122
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,920
 He said, "I remember in that moment I was so panicked that I was insane."

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,080
 He goes, "I remember.

124
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,120
 I won't go to a hospital.

125
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,640
 And when they take me out of the house, when they try to transport me to the psych ward,

126
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,520
 I'm going to find the tallest building in the area and I'm going to run up.

127
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
 I can see myself running up the stairs.

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,480
 The pursuer is quick behind me.

129
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:33,560
 And when I know I'm far enough up, I'm going to jump out a window, kill myself."

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,360
 He said that he felt like his brain was creating a backup plan.

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,160
 Better dead than crazy.

132
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:55,120
 His body had almost issued a self-destruct initiative.

133
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,840
 He says he's stuck in this for an hour.

134
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,320
 The feeling is not going away.

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,680
 He sees visions of madness and suicide.

136
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
 Then his mom comes.

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,200
 "Right, this is the perfect time for your mom to show up when you're on the edge."

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
 And he tells his mom.

139
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,720
 He goes, "Mom, mom, did I watch this show yesterday?"

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
 And the mom's probably like, "What?

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 That's weird.

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
 Yes, yes.

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
 You have watched the fairly odd parents before."

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,920
 And he goes, "That put me oddly at ease."

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,840
 Then I turn to my sister and he goes, "Hey.

146
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,200
 You know this whole thing where I got up and I've been walking around for like an hour?

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,680
 I've been pacing around this room and practicing my jumping skills, practicing my running from

148
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 guys with big nets from the psych ward.

149
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,240
 That was crazy, huh?

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,520
 How long have I been doing that for?"

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 And she says, sister goes, "What?

152
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,720
 You can do this for like five minutes.

153
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
 What do you mean an hour?

154
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
 What are you talking about?

155
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
 Did you notice you were jumping a lot?

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,800
 Getting those calf muscles ready?"

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,800
 And Terry goes, "Those five minutes will never leave me."

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,440
 Like that experience, he couldn't believe that it was only five minutes long.

159
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,280
 But the fact that he felt like he was, it was two things going on.

160
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,160
 One, he goes, "I felt like I was losing my mind.

161
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
 I felt like I had no control over perception."

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,960
 He goes, "But what scared me more than that was the fact that I so quickly came up with

163
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,760
 the idea on how to kill myself."

164
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,240
 Because I'm not someone who indulges in self-harm.

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,160
 That's what scared him.

166
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,800
 That it took this little glitch in his brain to make him go, "Well, I guess I'm gonna have

167
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,760
 to kill myself now."

168
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,440
 From somebody who never engaged in that thought process to completely planning out how what

169
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 happened.

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,720
 That's always the big thing we look at when people are talking about suicide.

171
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
 Do they have a plan?

172
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,320
 And do they have the means to make that plan happen?

173
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
 And he had a plan.

174
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,160
 He knew exactly what he was going to do if they tried taking him to a psych ward.

175
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,280
 That's what scared him.

176
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,640
 And I find it really interesting because a lot of times on the show we talk about people

177
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
 who snap.

178
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,800
 That's one of the scariest things to me because you think the person who's kind of weird, we

179
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,120
 covered that story, the woman she was watching Jeepers Creepers all the time, which is weird

180
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,640
 anyways because those movies suck.

181
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
 She's watching Jeepers Creepers all the time.

182
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,760
 She's watching all these horror movies.

183
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,640
 She started calling up just random numbers saying she was gonna chop people's heads off

184
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
 and murder them.

185
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,360
 And the police got involved with the mother.

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
 She's like, "No, she's a good girl."

187
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,160
 And then eventually the woman chopped off her mom's head and threw it across the yard at

188
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,560
 her neighbor.

189
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,120
 That was like a descent of madness.

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,280
 That was...

191
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,480
 It's an unfortunate story, but you see the warning signs all throughout there.

192
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
 Then we covered the story.

193
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 I'll see if I can find it.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
 It's one of my most terrifying stories, honestly, about the guy who was smoking

195
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,280
 weed with his best friend's girlfriend.

196
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,240
 And they're smoking weed together and then at one point he goes into the bathroom and

197
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,160
 a demon appears in the mirror and says, "You gotta kill her!

198
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,120
 You gotta kill her!"

199
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,880
 And then he leaves the bathroom and stabs her to death.

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,240
 She actually put up a big fight like the knife broke off in her.

201
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,000
 She pulls the knife blade out and begins stabbing him, but he unfortunately won that fight.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But yeah, just snapped.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
 All right, I'm just drug induced.

204
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,600
 But still, totally normal person as far as we can tell.

205
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,520
 Next thing he knows there's a demon in the mirror.

206
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,960
 So the people who snap are the ones that are the scariest because that could happen to anyone.

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,520
 And you could argue that maybe that guy did have some mental health.

208
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,240
 I mean, again, he did murder someone.

209
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,200
 He might have had some mental health issues before then as well, but who knows?

210
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 Maybe he just snapped.

211
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,880
 And those stories are always scary to me, but a lot of times we don't hear about the

212
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
 story until after the bad thing has happened.

213
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,360
 Because obviously if he snaps and then goes to the psychiatrist or psychologist or chaplain

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,000
 or whoever he goes to for guidance and they help him, that's not a local news story or

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
 a national news story.

216
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
 That's good!

217
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
 Right?

218
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,920
 That's the best option ever.

219
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,840
 But generally we hear about these people when they snapped and they've done something

220
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,040
 evil, morally corrupt.

221
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,320
 So this is interesting because we have the story of someone who did snap and didn't do

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 anything awful.

223
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,520
 But they'll always be in fear of that because of how quickly they were ready to end it all.

224
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,160
 Their brain hit a little glitch, hit a little five minute glitch, and who knows what caused

225
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
 that.

226
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,500
 But in that five minute time period, they thought about killing themselves, seriously

227
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,960
 killing themselves.

228
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,720
 That's a creepy story.

229
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,800
 But you know what's not creepy?

230
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,960
 And you gotta wonder, you gotta wonder, "What happened to this dude?"

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,920
 "What happened to us?"

232
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,680
 And if it does, would we have the same reaction?

233
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,880
 And what if this didn't just last five minutes?

234
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,960
 What if it did last an hour?

235
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,200
 Or two hours?

236
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,000
 Or eight hours?

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,080
 We may never hear the story, it may just be a tragic local story about a young man jumped

238
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
 out of a building.

239
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,240
 "Yeah boy, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic cup, we're leaving behind

240
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,560
 this dude, hope everything is okay for you.

241
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,520
 We are headed all the way out to a local Burger King."

242
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,680
 You're like, "Damn it, Jason!"

243
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,960
 And the reason why we're at this Burger King is not because they're the sponsor of this

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
 episode.

245
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,280
 Because they're not legally, I can't say that they are.

246
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,600
 But the reason why we're sitting in this Burger King is because I want to show you guys something.

247
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 Follow me.

248
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
 "Damn it, Jason, what type of awareness is going to happen now?"

249
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 Follow me into this tunnel.

250
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 Right?

251
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,800
 It's a mysterious tunnel I've dug underneath Burger King.

252
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,560
 We go into this secret tunnel, we do a secret handshake, and then I pull out the BK Crown

253
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
 card.

254
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,080
 You go, "What man, that's just some gift card, anyone can buy those?"

255
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,360
 And I go, "No, no, no, take a closer look at it."

256
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,960
 And you realize this is THE Big King Crown card.

257
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,200
 The Big King Crown card, there's only 12 of them in existence.

258
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,880
 And what this card guarantees is unlimited Burger King for the rest of your life.

259
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,000
 George Lucas has one.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,600
 George Lucas has a BK Crown card, and here's why.

261
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,560
 Like in 1977, he said, "You know what, I have this sci-fi movie called Star Wars, and I think

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
 it's going to be a big hit.

263
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,000
 And I am going to partner with Burger King."

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,840
 Like this is before merchandising was really even a thing for our movies.

265
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,920
 "I'm going to partner with Burger King, we're going to offer Star Wars glasses at Burger

266
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,960
 King for this dope movie that I'm making."

267
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,920
 And he loved his partnership with Burger King so much that even Revenge of the Sith, when

268
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,240
 he was still directing the movies, they had their tie-in with Burger King.

269
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,560
 Now I remember getting Phantom Menace mugs like cups at Toggle Bell, but apparently the

270
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,800
 real good stuff was at Burger King.

271
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,680
 Jennifer Hudson from American Idol, she was also in that movie Dream Girls, she's a singer.

272
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,600
 She has one, she has a Burger King Crown card, because she used to work there and she used

273
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,800
 to sing, this was before American Idol, she's not doing this now, but before American Idol,

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,040
 before she struck it big with her career, she used to sing at the drive-in.

275
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,160
 Now Hugh Laurie, famous actor Hugh Laurie, he did an interview and he said in his interview,

276
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,360
 you know what, I get a lot of celebrity perks, right?

277
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,760
 I'm Dr. House, I have this big show on Fox, and I walk around and people are like, "Diagnose

278
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,360
 me, diagnose me, I'm dying of this horrible rare disease, Mr. House."

279
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,480
 And he's like, "First off, I'm a doctor, secondly, I'm not a doctor, it's just television

280
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 show."

281
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,240
 But he goes, "My favorite celebrity perk, the number one celebrity perk is the Burger

282
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,760
 King Crown card."

283
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,280
 I love it so much that I think it might be the best thing about being a celebrity.

284
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,200
 Now here's the thing, he didn't have a card at the time.

285
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,360
 He did an interview talking about how much he loved Burger King and how much he wanted

286
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,520
 a card and he was saying it was the ultimate celebrity perk, he'd heard about it and he

287
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,400
 knew there was only 11 of these in existence at the time, so he put it out there that it

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,800
 was the biggest thing, so Burger King gave him a Burger King Crown card.

289
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,280
 Now you go, "Jason, wait a second, are you trying to tell us that all of this Burger

290
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,040
 King nonsense you've done during this episode, are you hoping in some weird way that Burger

291
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,520
 King sends you a free Burger King Crown card because you talked about it on this podcast?

292
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,360
 I will not confirm or deny that I'm using this show to get freebies."

293
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,480
 However, if Burger King would like to repay my promotion on this podcast, number one science

294
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,080
 podcast in El Salvador, Burger King, if they'd like to repay me by giving me a Burger King

295
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
 Crown card, they can do it.

296
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,720
 I'm not going to turn it into some coupons, send me some coupons to my peel box, but the

297
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,600
 reason why I wanted to talk about Burger King wasn't just so I could get some free Burger

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,400
 King and I swear, if Burger King sends me free stuff, this podcast will become nothing

299
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,840
 but me talking about how great Nordstrom's is and how I love shoes from Nike.

300
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,960
 But until that happens, I will not be a complete sellout.

301
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,560
 The reason why I wanted to talk about this and talk about insanity, and I love this story,

302
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,840
 this is so interesting, the other person who has one of these Burger King Crown cards is

303
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,640
 Robert Downey Jr.

304
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,040
 The reason why I'm talking about this is Robert Downey Jr. owes his life to Burger King and

305
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,400
 he's talked about this.

306
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,840
 He's talked about this and when it came to him making Iron Man, which a lot of people

307
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:52,040
 don't remember, he was a washed up actor who had been to jail multiple times in the middle

308
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
 of his career.

309
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,240
 Like he didn't have a career, he was a joke, he was a joke.

310
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
 Got into drugs, he got into drugs hard.

311
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,800
 But his comeback movie, like it was huge for him.

312
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,600
 No one knew if the MCU was going to be big when they made Iron Man, as far as they knew

313
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,320
 this was either going to be a hit like Spider-Man, or this was going to be a flop like the Roger

314
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,360
 Corman Fantastic Four or the Dolph Lundgren Punisher.

315
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,520
 Or even the made for TV Doctor Strange movie that came out in the late 70s.

316
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,640
 Like you didn't know.

317
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,760
 There was no MCU, it could have ended right there.

318
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,160
 You have Robert Downey Jr. who'd come off a long time period where he was not acting.

319
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,920
 You had a comedy director making this superhero movie.

320
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,560
 It could have ended up like Jonah Hex or Constantine, just like a novelty movie, kind of interesting.

321
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,400
 In that movie, he goes and he, after he's rescued, he's not even rescued actually, he

322
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,680
 breaks out of the terror, spoiler heard, he breaks out of the terrorist hideout building

323
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
 the Mark-1 Iron Man suit.

324
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,400
 When he gets back to America, he says, "I want, the first thing I want is an American

325
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 cheeseburger."

326
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,560
 And the next scene he's walking around, he's eating Burger King.

327
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
 That was not product placement.

328
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,040
 He goes, "I want Burger King in this movie because Tony Stark's journey is my journey

329
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,560
 and Burger King changed my life."

330
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,280
 So because of that, Burger King actually has given him a crown card and you'll see articles

331
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,800
 with headlines like, "Burger King helped me beat addiction," Robert Downey Jr. says.

332
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,160
 That's a nice way to put it.

333
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,860
 Because let's take a look at why he actually did this.

334
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,200
 Before Iron Man, when he was still having some serious drug issues, he was driving around

335
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,880
 with a lot of dope in his car.

336
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,920
 A lot of drugs, right?

337
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,080
 And he stops at a Burger King and he goes, "I'm there and I get this burger and I get

338
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,360
 this drink and I'm eating it and this burger is so disgusting.

339
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:52,760
 It is the greasiest piece of garbage I've ever eaten and I'm eating it and I get this

340
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,200
 gut feeling."

341
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:02,200
 Robert, Robert, something really, really bad is about to happen.

342
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,160
 He said, "I heard the message loud and clear."

343
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,960
 He goes, "I took those drugs, I dumped them in the ocean, cleaned up my life, never looked

344
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
 back."

345
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,360
 And he goes, "I owe it to Burger King."

346
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,760
 So Burger King leaves out the fact that their burger was so disgusting.

347
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,880
 It made someone stop being a drug addict, but he felt it.

348
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,680
 He knew something bad was going to happen and who knows what could have been.

349
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,760
 Best case scenario, right?

350
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
 He got pulled over by the cops and he gets busted for all these drugs and he does five

351
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,480
 years in prison because he had already done a year in prison for previous crimes.

352
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,000
 So worst case scenario, right?

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,840
 He dies of an overdose.

354
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,520
 He gets robbed for the drugs, someone kills him.

355
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,720
 He's just some washed-up actor who dies in some crappy apartment somewhere.

356
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,120
 Burger King changed his life and that was the moment it changed and he goes, "That's

357
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,520
 why I had it in Tony Stark's life as well, where he goes from being a weapons manufacturer

358
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,240
 to someone who's trying to save the world."

359
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,080
 And I like the idea of people listening to their guts, listening to what the universe

360
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,400
 is trying to tell them.

361
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,840
 And on this same topic of listening to your gut, and listening, sometimes it's not just

362
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
 your gut, right?

363
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,360
 Sometimes it's not just, "I don't know if I should do that."

364
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,080
 Sometimes it's straight-up hearing voices, audibly hearing voices, which we would account

365
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
 as a mental illness.

366
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,520
 Do those ever tell you to do good things.

367
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,800
 We covered an episode a long time ago about a woman who heard voices and they told her

368
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
 to go get checked out and she had a tumor.

369
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
 She had a brain tumor.

370
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 Very interesting episode.

371
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 I'll put that on the show notes.

372
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,880
 But let's head out to West Chicago, Illinois.

373
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,640
 We'll finish up our Burger King real quick.

374
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,520
 We're headed out to West Chicago, Illinois.

375
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
 It's 1859.

376
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,960
 We're going to meet a young man.

377
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
 He's actually not a man.

378
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,080
 He's a young boy, four-year-old boy, known as Arthur Stillwell.

379
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,040
 He'd be playing at home in this house back in 1859, so moms like washing dishes and they

380
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,280
 were like, "Are they going to afford doors?"

381
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
 And he would go, "Aunt Sally's coming.

382
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,520
 You know Aunt Sally's coming, mom?"

383
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,640
 And the mom would be like, "Well, yeah, I'm sure she's coming.

384
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
 I hope she does.

385
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 She owes me $5.

386
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
 That'll buy doors."

387
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,720
 A couple days later, Aunt Sally would show up.

388
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,320
 Uh-huh, that's weird.

389
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040
 Why did I have to have the weirdo kid?

390
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,600
 And Arthur Stillwell, the neighborhood weirdo, would be able to predict a couple days ahead

391
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 of him.

392
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 Who was going to show up?

393
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,840
 Now, 1852, it took a while to get places, right?

394
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,920
 So he had ample notice, but how's he known about this?

395
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,440
 Are they sending telegrams?

396
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
 No.

397
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,560
 The voices.

398
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,360
 He actually called them the brownies.

399
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 He named this collection of voices.

400
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,080
 He goes, "I don't know their individual names.

401
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,400
 I don't even know how many there are, but there's a bunch of voices that I hear."

402
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,360
 And they said the reason why they talk to me is because it's easy for them to talk to

403
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 me.

404
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,040
 He goes, "They try talking to other people, and other people don't hear them, but I hear

405
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 them.

406
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,320
 I hear these voices."

407
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,560
 That's a parlor trick, right?

408
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,160
 Being able to pick out who's going to be here.

409
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,480
 Maybe he was wrong sometimes.

410
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,560
 Maybe it's selective.

411
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,440
 You know, you remember the times he got it right, but you don't remember the times he

412
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,080
 got it wrong.

413
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 We do that all the time.

414
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,720
 Every time I look at a clock, it's 11, 11.

415
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,560
 No, you look at clocks all day long.

416
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,800
 You just remember that you see 11, 11 over and over again.

417
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,000
 So at age 14, when him and his mom are walking, and Arthur points at a girl and goes, "I'm

418
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 going to marry.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,320
 I'm going to marry that girl in five years."

420
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,080
 Mom goes, "She's had enough of this guy's weirdness.

421
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,480
 She's never met this girl before.

422
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,360
 They don't know who this girl is, but there he is.

423
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,240
 I'm going to marry that girl in five years."

424
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,040
 Her son's a weirdo, but she knows that that's probably going to happen.

425
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,720
 Sure enough.

426
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
 Five years later, he marries Genevieve Wood.

427
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,080
 He gets a good job at a local company, quickly promoted.

428
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,800
 Life is good for him.

429
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 But the voices tell him, "Go west and build railroads."

430
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 He doesn't want to.

431
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 He has a good job.

432
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 He has a good job.

433
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,400
 We talked about jobs on yesterday's episode, right?

434
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
 He has a good job.

435
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,080
 And that's all when you have a good job and you love your job, that's the best combination.

436
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,240
 He doesn't want to leave.

437
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
 But the voices won't let him go.

438
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
 Go west and build railroads.

439
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
 He's trying to take a bath.

440
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,160
 Go west and build railroads.

441
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
 What else do you do in 1852?

442
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,720
 He's trying to, I don't know, bail hay.

443
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
 Go west and build railroads.

444
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,720
 He has no choice but to tell his wife, "Hey, listen, you know those voices I've been hearing

445
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 for a while.

446
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
 Yes, Arthur, I know the voices.

447
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,800
 You're telling me to go west, they won't give up?

448
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 What should we do?"

449
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 Well, honey, guess we go west.

450
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,160
 Him and Genevieve actually have to, like, borrow a cart, right?

451
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,120
 They don't have their own horse and buggy.

452
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,080
 They had to borrow a cart, they loaded their stuff up on it, they go out to Kansas.

453
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,960
 Arthur gets a job at a brokerage firm, starts to learn about banking, starts making connections,

454
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,200
 starts getting loans, and buys up land.

455
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,120
 And with his business connections, with his access to money and investors, he starts building

456
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,680
 railroads all over the country.

457
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,720
 Arthur Stillwell is responsible for laying 3,000 miles of railroads.

458
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,280
 Now he wasn't John Henry out there himself with the sledgehammer, but without Arthur

459
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,360
 Stillwell's drive and money, these railroads wouldn't have been built.

460
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,640
 They definitely wouldn't be built in this time period.

461
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,360
 Eventually, probably America, these things would have been needed, but at this time,

462
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,960
 his company is responsible for 3,000 miles of railroads and, along these railroads, 40

463
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,920
 towns spring up, including Stillwell, Illinois, from his home state.

464
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
 There's cities named after him.

465
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,240
 He was so important to the expansion of transportation in America.

466
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,280
 And as he's building these railroads, he goes, "Okay, so the terminus for this giant rail

467
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,360
 line I'm building is going to be in Galveston, Texas."

468
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,800
 And the brownies are like, "Mmm, we don't know about that."

469
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,640
 Because there's about to be a massive disaster in the city of Galveston, and if you have

470
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,720
 your terminus there, it's going to get washed away, you're going to have to rebuild it.

471
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,600
 And no one's going to want to go there, right?

472
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
 The entire place is destroyed.

473
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,120
 So you can have the railroad go through Galveston, but keep going.

474
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,840
 Keep going to Sabine Lake.

475
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,320
 Just a little bit further.

476
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,360
 Keep going to Sabine Lake and have the terminus be there.

477
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,520
 And he goes, "We took a journey out and we're scouting the area."

478
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,520
 And he goes, "I get to Sabine Lake and I just go..."

479
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,360
 There it is, guys.

480
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
 See that right there?

481
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,240
 And he's looking out at the Lake area and he's pointing it out.

482
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,920
 He goes, "That is going to be where the main port is, and it's just a bunch of land.

483
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,420
 It's a bunch of undeveloped land.

484
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,760
 We're going to put a port here.

485
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,000
 This is where the city's going to be.

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,480
 I saw in my eyes the city spring up like magic, like it was being created from my mind into

487
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,680
 reality."

488
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
 And that is what happened.

489
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,240
 The city of Port Arthur, named after him, grew out of nowhere.

490
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,720
 That's what the Brownies told him to do.

491
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
 That's what he did.

492
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 And Galveston was hit by one of the worst natural disasters in American history.

493
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,320
 I don't know why he didn't warn anybody.

494
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,680
 I guess at that point, you would think he was insane.

495
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,320
 Now, his family knew about the Brownies.

496
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,560
 His wife knew about the Brownies.

497
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,520
 I don't think his business investors knew about the Brownies.

498
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 And the people of Galveston, Texas, are you going to believe him, even though he's this

499
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,800
 astute businessman, he's laid all this railroad, would you believe him if he did warn you?

500
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:12,640
 He not only laid this railroad, he not only ran this business, he was also a poet, a songwriter,

501
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,800
 an author.

502
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,000
 He's publishing all this stuff and he's running this company and he's envisioning these cities

503
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,520
 springing up out of nowhere.

504
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,160
 Forty cities were founded by this guy.

505
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,480
 He has this great quote, though.

506
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,440
 "The engineering plans that I've put in effect have all come from an engineer who has been

507
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,280
 long dead.

508
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,320
 I have transcribed scores of poems which have been dictated to me by poets.

509
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:50,720
 I have written the music of many songs which have been dictated to me by musicians."

510
00:27:50,720 --> 00:28:01,280
 The Brownies were funneling this beautiful art through him.

511
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,800
 Now were they deceased people?

512
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,640
 Were they guardian angels?

513
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,160
 Not for the people of Galveston, Texas, but for him.

514
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
 What was this?

515
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
 What were these voices?

516
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
 And they seemed to be right.

517
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,760
 It's one thing to pull the parlor trick.

518
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
 I can guess who's coming to dinner.

519
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 But it's another thing to allow a country to thrive on the advice of voices in your head.

520
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:36,640
 Something that would get you put in a psych ward if you admitted out loud.

521
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,040
 You built a nation.

522
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:51,200
 But for all of the Brownies' ability in writing poetry and laying track and seeing the future,

523
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
 not good with money.

524
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,600
 Not good with money, these Brownies, because he ended up running a foul of unscrupulous

525
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,920
 investors and he got ripped off.

526
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:07,360
 The company went into default and when the end finally came for Arthur Stillwell on

527
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:15,160
 September 26, 1928, he suffered a stroke which killed him and he only had a net worth of

528
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 $1,000.

529
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,480
 Now that is $1,000 old-timey money.

530
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,000
 But that's still not a ton of money.

531
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:35,600
 His company was devoured by ruthless investors taking back what they felt was owed to them.

532
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,840
 13 days later, his wife so distraught over the loss of her husband.

533
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 Here's a weird coincidence.

534
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,800
 I didn't really think about this when I put these stories together.

535
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,320
 She jumped out of their apartment, killing herself.

536
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:58,720
 An odd footnote to this story, an odd footnote to this already bizarre story is that their

537
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:07,560
 ashes, Arthur and Genevieve's ashes were going to be buried together, together in death like

538
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,100
 they were in life.

539
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,880
 Someone broke into the mortuary and stole their ashes.

540
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,560
 We've had a theme throughout this show on a couple of episodes about is it possible that

541
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,080
 people...

542
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,760
 Is there a group out there that's trying to collect these items that may be cursed or

543
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,040
 blessed or have some sort of connection to the paranormal?

544
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,360
 We covered that story recently.

545
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,980
 I forgot to mention this, but I mentioned it briefly.

546
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:46,040
 There was the college that had a haunted stained glass window and someone stole the window.

547
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,840
 They removed it for safekeeping and then it disappeared.

548
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
 I didn't get to mention it on that episode.

549
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,720
 I'll put it in the show notes, but I wanted to add maybe that window has also ended up

550
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
 in someone's collection.

551
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,960
 When you have these items that are truly haunted, is it sitting in a dusty basement just misplaced,

552
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
 mislabeled?

553
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,040
 Or are there people who collect these items or government agencies that collect these

554
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,960
 items of paranormal importance?

555
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,720
 If the government's trying to reverse engineer a UFO, I don't think they would be like, "Haunted

556
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
 paintings!

557
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 That's ridiculous!

558
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 I don't know."

559
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
 No, you would have an agency trying to collect that stuff as well.

560
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
 So where did that mirror go?

561
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,000
 Where did their ashes go?

562
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,720
 This man heard, clearly heard voices from beyond.

563
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
 Wouldn't you want his ashes?

564
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,520
 Like, Jason, no, I'm not a monster, but you would!

565
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
 It's something, right?

566
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,360
 It is something.

567
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,040
 If that's what you were in charge of was collecting these items, that would be something to get.

568
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:53,280
 The remains of a bonafide psychic.

569
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,840
 Probably one of the most powerful psychic, power, most powerful channeler, however you

570
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,280
 want to put it, in American history.

571
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,480
 Sylvia Brown didn't set up 40 towns.

572
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,280
 Urie Geller has not laid one single track of railroads, right?

573
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,640
 This guy changed American life.

574
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,360
 And Brownies told him to do it.

575
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,880
 So from a man who almost committed suicide, because he got stuck in a time loop for five

576
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:35,600
 minutes, to a man who spent his entire life building railroads, because the voices in his

577
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,480
 head told him to.

578
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,760
 Insanity takes many forms.

579
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,720
 The question is, can the insane be beneficial to humanity?

580
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,440
 And that's really the story of Arthur Stillwell.

581
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,920
 And I would even say that's the story of Robert Downey Jr.

582
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,120
 To look at this disgusting burger and take a couple bites out of it and make a connection

583
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,980
 and see the future.

584
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:08,800
 See yourself dead or destitute or imprisoned.

585
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,720
 He sees that in just a few bites of a burger.

586
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,960
 He gets that gut instinct.

587
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,120
 None of those are rational.

588
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
 Any scientist would say, well, it doesn't matter.

589
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,480
 It does just all neurons, fire, fire, nothing to bring.

590
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,560
 Deja vu is this and that's just Burger King.

591
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,680
 This other guy, he was just a coincidence.

592
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,560
 He heard voices and then he built these railroads.

593
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,400
 But to the people who have a passion for the paranormal, all of these things are kind

594
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,160
 of a through line.

595
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,440
 Our grasp on a reality and all of us have this is tenuous at best.

596
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:52,440
 A small snap, a small snag in that fabric can send a spiraling down into insanity.

597
00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:01,640
 The question is, is it a bad insanity that makes you hurt yourself or others?

598
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,920
 Or is it, I don't even know if this is a thing, or is it good insanity that saves your

599
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,680
 lives?

600
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,320
 Or guides you to build cities?

601
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,840
 Cities Arthur built.

602
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,320
 Is insanity so awful if it reshapes society?

603
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,640
 Good insanity.

604
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:35,760
 If there is such a thing as good insanity, I wish more people had it.

605
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,200
