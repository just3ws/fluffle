00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Is it possible that the voices in your head are telling you good things?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,560
 And then we travel to what might be the most wicked place on earth.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,160
 Canock Chase in England. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:27,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,040
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,720
 First off, let's give a shout out to the newest supporter of our show, Brandeen.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,920
 Brandeen, thank you so much for supporting the show. You are going to be our captain,

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
 our driver, our rowboat operator, whatever vehicle we take today. You're in charge of that.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,040
 It really, really helps out a lot. We also got a merch store. We got a Minecraft server.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,240
 Are you ready Brandeen? She's nodding. She's nodding super eagerly. She's ready to go. This

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,360
 episode gets dark and it gets dark fast. The first story's nice, right? So if you don't want your

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,040
 day ruined, listen to the first story and half of the second story. So Brandeen, let's go ahead and

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,760
 start off in the Carpentercopter. We got a long journey ahead of us. We're headed out to the United

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,960
 Kingdom. We're headed out to Coventry. Helicopters cutting waves over the ocean. Octopuses are

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,440
 rolled up. There are tentacles. They're shaking it at us because we woke them up from their nap.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,680
 Do animals nap? I know cats do. I'm like bears and stuff, but do fish?

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,400
 Anyways, it doesn't matter. Maybe I should just research that instead of just asking random questions

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,800
 because fish sleep, right? I guess I could just google that. Hello, Brandeen's looking at me. She's

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,400
 like, "Just tell the ghost stories, bro. I should do a biology podcast. I'm sure it would be

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,840
 amazing." We're going to an Aldi supermarket in Coventry and it's May 19th, 2020. And as the

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,400
 helicopter's landing, we see a young man. He's pushed his shopping cart into the Aldi supermarket

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,480
 and we're going to walk behind him. We're going to walk very, very close behind him

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,200
 and we're holding up newspapers so he doesn't know that we're there, which I don't think he

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,600
 can still sense us. He just can't recognize us. And he's walking through the shopping market

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,680
 and he's like figuring stuff out. He's like, "Oh yeah, I like to eat that, but I don't like to

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
 eat that. I won't buy that. I won't make that mistake again." And then he hears, "Buy a lottery ticket."

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,040
 What? Is there like a looks up? Is there like overhead speakers in the shopping center?

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,680
 He knows that he just heard someone go, "Buy a lottery ticket." He turns around and sees some

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
 totally non-suspicious looking people holding newspapers a couple inches from his back. He's

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,920
 like, "It's not those guys. Hmm. He's thinking, "Should I buy a lottery ticket?" He's bought like

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,040
 scratchers and stuff like that before, but he's never bought a lottery ticket. He's like, "Eh,

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,600
 that's weird. Must just be a voice in my head." It's not weird, right? Better make an appointment with

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,880
 my GP. Make sure you don't have a tumor. He drives home. He turns on the radio. It's like, "No,

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,760
 the news hit from the Beatles. Buy a lottery ticket. Bye, bye, bye. A lottery ticket." He's

36
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
 like, "I don't like this song." And now the new rap song from Tupac who's still alive. He just came

37
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,520
 alive today. It's called "Bury Me with a Bought Lottery Ticket." He's like, "What? Tupac's alive?

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,240
 That's awesome, but I don't want to hear that song click." He's driving past billboards. He's

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,400
 driving past billboards for buy a lottery ticket reliters. And he's like, "I'm not. I'm not."

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,880
 He gets home. He hears the voice in his head at the grocery store. He doesn't buy a lottery ticket.

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,000
 He gets home. He's putting his groceries away. Buy a lottery ticket. He's like, "What and where is that

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,240
 coming from?" Now, I didn't know this. I always talk about how great the country of the United

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:55,520
 States of America is. We're not perfect, but we're on the path, right? But did you know? Did you know?

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,400
 This upset me. This upset me as an American. Did you know that you can buy lottery tickets online

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,440
 in Britain? And I have to walk to buy my lottery tickets. Had I known that this is how a history

46
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,560
 would have played out? No revolutionary war for this man. I would have straight up been a red

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,920
 code. I'd be like, "Dude, Paul Revere's about to start doing stuff, guys. He's over there. He's

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,840
 over there." And then I'm like, "I know. I know my sacrifice will not be in vain. Someday my descendants

49
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,400
 will be able to buy lottery tickets online." So because I live in this prison planet, because I

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,240
 live in this dystopian hell future, I have to walk to the gas station to buy lottery tickets. However,

51
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,280
 in the in the Brighton sunny monarchy that is Britain, our once and future home,

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,760
 you can buy lottery tickets online. So he was like, "He heard the voice again." Then he heard me rant my

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,080
 anti-American rant. He's like, "Oh, that's weird. Why am I hearing that?" Turns around, there's a couple

54
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
 people reading newspapers sitting in his house. He's like, "He goes online. He buys a lottery ticket.

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,680
 Wins one million dollars. A million bucks. Isn't that awesome? That's a cool story. I really like...

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
 And he's like, it's so funny because they're like, "So what are you gonna do with it?" And he's like,

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,040
 "I've always wanted to build a patio." Well, my neighbors used to laugh at me. I said, "I wanted to

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,320
 build a patio." And they're like, "You'll never get that done. His name's Simon Waddup." I should have

59
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,760
 said that earlier. His name's Simon, but he's like, "What are you gonna do with a million dollars?"

60
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,760
 He's like, "I'm gonna go on vacation. My wife wants me to go on vacation. I think my daughter wants

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:35,040
 a car, but yeah, I want to build a patio." Small dreams do not always mean small results. Isn't

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,480
 that cool though? Hopefully he doesn't get scammed out of it, that he is able to build his patio,

63
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,040
 builds like a nice... Doesn't have to be super patio. Doesn't have to be a million dollar patio.

64
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,440
 But that's awesome. I love that story. The moral of the story is if the voices in your head tell

65
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,920
 you to do something, you better do. No, it's funny because you would think 99% of the time,

66
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,640
 if you hear a voice in your head, we cover another story with that woman who heard those voices in

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,720
 her head telling her to go to the doctor. And it turns out she had a brain tumor. And then when

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,680
 they were like taking it out or after they took it out, the voices go, "Bye." That was a cool one.

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
 The tale of the talking tumor. You can look that one up. That was a really cool episode.

70
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,120
 Usually voices in your head are bad, right? They're not things that you want.

71
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,400
 But yeah, this one worked out good. As long as it's not like, buy a lottery ticket and then

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,240
 sacrifice your cats for the winning numbers. No, it was just like buy a lottery ticket. He heard it

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,120
 twice. I'll say, what if this is time travel? Like this is time travel, but it's so lame.

74
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,200
 You can't travel back in time, but you can only send your voice back in time. Maybe he uses this

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,280
 million dollars to help fund time travel. But again, it's just a microphone. You can time travel

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,200
 back in time with the microphone. Let's go ahead, Brandeem. As you guys, Brandeem's hearing voices.

77
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,000
 She's like, "Must kill Jason." No, no, no. That's bad. That's bad advice. That's bad advice.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,280
 And she's like, "Must fight the temptation to murder you." We finally talk her down. She hands

79
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,640
 around my throat. We're running out of time. No, no, no. There's just the voices in your head.

80
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,920
 She's like, "Must fight it. I'm better now. I'm gonna have to be suspicious of her."

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,720
 She has to walk in front of me for the rest of the episode. But we're gonna hop back in the

82
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,160
 Carbentercopter. We're waving goodbye to Simon. He's sitting on his patio and his daughter's

83
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,200
 driving a car and his wife's on vacation. It's the perfect life. He's home alone on his patio.

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,640
 We're saying goodbye to Simon and his family. We are headed out to Kenok Chase that's in

85
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:42,480
 Stratfordshire, England. Helicopter's flying over this beautiful forested area. You listened to

86
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,160
 the first story. It was pretty nice. It was very nice, actually. This story, there's a limit where

87
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,880
 you're gonna be like, "Yeah, I'm out." So we're gonna land the helicopter. We're all gonna hop out

88
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,680
 of the copter. And we're gonna walk around this forested area. Now this is a story that moves

89
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,680
 in degrees. Starts off just mildly annoying and gets dark. Let's look at this place to land

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
 called Kenok Chase. I've talked about this theory before on this show. And recently on my episode

91
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,040
 about did Peeristory Creatures help build the pyramids. Places, I believe, people talk about

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,840
 like haunted places. I believe places can be infused with energy. You can go to a babbling brook.

93
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,960
 You can go to a beautiful cathedral. You could go to a grove of trees and you feel at peace there.

94
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,440
 I believe the land, if the cathedral was 50 feet to the west, you could go in that cathedral and

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,600
 you're like, "Yeah, it's alright." But it's the piece of land that adds to the grace, the energy,

96
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 in that area. Because there may be nothing there and you go there and you just feel at peace.

97
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
 There should be, the inverse should be true as well then, because we've all experienced that.

98
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,840
 We've also, a lot of us have experienced this. You go to a place that is otherwise mundane.

99
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,520
 You feel chilled. You feel dark. Something's wrong in that area. You can't really put your

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,000
 finger on it. If a place of goodness exists, the inverse must be true. There must be a place

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,960
 that's bad. And while places like Yosemite or these natural waterfalls and stuff like this

102
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,680
 will attract people who want to see natural beauty, these dark places will attract the darkness in

103
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,080
 humans. Kenok Chase, I believe, is one of those places. We're going to start off with a more

104
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,840
 annoyance than anything. Kenok Chase is known for a lot of things and one of the annoying things.

105
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,440
 I mean, again, if you saw this, you wouldn't be like, "Humanity is lost!" You would just be like,

106
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,200
 "Okay, let's back up the picnic, honey. We are going home." Kenok Chase has a lot of what British

107
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,920
 people called "dogging." And that's basically, so we're all walking through the woods. And the

108
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,400
 carbonic opteer is now too far away for us to get to in case we have to run to it. We're walking

109
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,320
 through the woods. I have a machete. I'm like chopping down brush. You guys are like, "Jason,

110
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,840
 it's not that thick." I'm like, "I'm just being prepared." And I break through this brush and we

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,320
 see two people having sex. You hear the chair squeaking as I'm making the motion? These two

112
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,840
 people are having sex. And then there's like two other people watching. I don't know if it's like

113
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,320
 America's Got Talent and they're just judging them. They're like, "Hmm, the passion's there, but I'm

114
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,000
 not sure about the technique." Oh, no, no, no. They definitely have the technique down, but

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,160
 I think that they're about to... Yes, yes, that his back gave out. I don't know. Or if they're,

116
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,560
 or probably masturbating, I guess, would probably be more likely Simon Cowles. But

117
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,720
 it's... Dogging in Britain is having sex in public with the intent of other people watching.

118
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
 Having sex in public, people do that all the time. It was called normal sex for about 10,000

119
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,920
 years, but this is having public sex and you want people to watch. So sometimes you'll invite people

120
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
 to be like, "Come on down. Come on down. It's going to be a sex jamboree." And you post it online,

121
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
 a bunch of people show up. I don't know if I think that I would get bored of that, right? Basically,

122
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
 it's like live action porn. I'm not a fan of porn anyways. And I'm just like, "What? Why am I..."

123
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,680
 And I think I've said this before too, I cannot watch any sort of porn and eat at the same time.

124
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
 And you're like, "Why would you even do that?" The other day I was sitting here, Sabine was over,

125
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,040
 and we were talking about Belle Delphine that I don't even know what she's an E-Celebrity. She

126
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,000
 plays video games or something like that. She had this launch video where she's like doing a

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
 rip-off of a Takashi 6'9" song. And I was eating and I was like, "Oh, did you see about this whole

128
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,320
 Belle Delphine thing?" And I pulled the video up and she's dancing. She's basically in a bikini

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,200
 covered in body paint. And I'm like eating and I was like, "I can't watch this while I'm eating."

130
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,960
 Like, I can't watch anything even vaguely erotic while I'm eating. That happens in Canak Chase.

131
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,640
 Not a huge deal. Again, we wouldn't want to be having a picnic. And you're worried about ants,

132
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,320
 right? And then you realize you see someone's ant actually getting railed. You know, you just

133
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
 don't want to see it. And that was a terrible joke. But anyways, just an annoyance. But that's not

134
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
 all. That's not all. I wouldn't base an episode on my main story, the episode, wouldn't it be sex

135
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,680
 in public? This place is also known for Bigfoot sightings, werewolf sightings, black dog sightings,

136
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,240
 which are these giant black phantom dogs. ABCs, which I believe stands for Alien Big Cats. It's

137
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,960
 a big thing in Britain and England where they're seeing panthers and jaguars and it's been going

138
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,160
 on for years and years. UFOs. Think about this. I just listed those because that's not even the

139
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,560
 most interesting stuff about Canak Chase. They're not even close. When Bigfoot's like, "Oh, me no

140
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,000
 interesting. Me start dogging then? You do story now." And I'm like, "No, Bigfoot. You're just kind

141
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,560
 of mundane. I think that's kind of gross what you're doing, but we're still not going to cover it.

142
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,240
 We might watch it for a little bit. No, no, no. We're done. We're done. We're over that stuff,

143
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,000
 right? Pie Green Tower. It's this facility that was built in Canak Chase. It's a pretty big area

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 of land. It was built there. It was built during the Cold War because the fear was if an EMP attack,

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,720
 basically any nuclear bomb causes an EMP attack. It basically was shut off all the electricity in

146
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,960
 the area. All your communications are down. They built this hardened communication structure in

147
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,360
 case of a nuke or just a straight EMP attack. You wouldn't lose all your communications.

148
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,480
 Or, that's the official story, or travel back to the 1980s. You have these British and American

149
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,360
 scientists working in this facility. Hey, give me that syringe. There's a woman laying on a slab.

150
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,160
 She's been put under. They give this giant syringe and they look at it dramatically. And inside of it

151
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,280
 is a little tiny baby pig fetus. And they're like, "Hmm, if our calculations are correct,

152
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,560
 we inject this into the woman. She'll have a pig baby or a human hybrid. We don't want,

153
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,760
 we just have normal pig babies. We want a hybrid. Why do we want a hybrid? Because we want to

154
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,760
 experiment on it." Which doesn't really make sense because you can experiment on humans and you can

155
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,520
 experiment on pigs. Why would you want, wouldn't that be the experiment? Can human women give birth

156
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,360
 to pigs? No, that's not the experiment. Dummy, we want to have a pig baby, a human pig baby,

157
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,240
 so we can experiment on that. So they basically impregnate this woman with a pig baby. And they're

158
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,040
 monitoring her and they're like, "Oh, one day they wake up. They're like, "Oh, it's been nine months.

159
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,680
 It's been nine months. If our theory works any minute now, little pig babies are going to jump

160
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
 out." So they're like looking at their watches and they're looking at the clock and looking at

161
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,480
 her watches and looking at her stomach and they're looking at the clock and they're like,

162
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,600
 "Oh, this didn't work. This didn't work. So what do we do now? It's been nine months." So the next

163
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,040
 month, the scientists are sitting around and they're still thinking, "Well, that didn't work." Like,

164
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,520
 all of that grant money that we asked for, we promised them a half human, half pig and she

165
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,320
 should have given birth nine months ago. And then they hear a "Waaaaaah!" "Waaaaaah!" "Waaaaaah!"

166
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
 And they're like, "What? Oh, we totally forgot that pregnant woman was still in the facility."

167
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,040
 So they go there and she is now given birth to a human baby with the head of a pig.

168
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,760
 They look at each other. It's a stupid experiment, right? I don't think scientists go,

169
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,320
 "Well, we're trying to create this monster, but it wasn't born in the same time a human is."

170
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,240
 Therefore, it was a failure. Apparently, they either let her go or they just forgot she was in

171
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
 the laboratory because when she gives birth to this human pig, they're completely shocked.

172
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,240
 They thought it would have come out a month ago. They raise the pig baby as their own because at

173
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,520
 some point, it becomes a teenager, starts wearing clothes and breaks out of the facility. "I hate

174
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,920
 you, stepdads. I'm out of here." And they're like, "We're not done doing experiments on you. I literally

175
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,880
 brought you into this world and I could take you out. I'm gone, dad. I'm gonna go find a new family."

176
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,320
 He runs. He sees a bunch of people dogging. He's like, "Okay, I'm done. You can put me back in the

177
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,280
 facility because whatever experiments you have planned for me, it's way less gross than that."

178
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,800
 I just saw a bunch of grandparents banging each other and they're like, "Waaaaaah!"

179
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
 So anyways, but that's not what happens. He did run off into the woods.

180
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,560
 What's interesting is that we've covered stories like the Poplic Monster was one where

181
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,040
 he supposedly was in a train and it got derailed and it was like this mutant and he's been running

182
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,800
 around for like a hundred years at this point. So you're like, even if the story was real,

183
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,760
 it was a normal mutant, normal mutant, whatever that means. It was a mutated human who was still

184
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,720
 able, who would still age, right? These stories, this is what's interesting. So this story took

185
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,880
 place in about the 80s. They stopped seeing him around 1993. The last real recorded sighting of

186
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,320
 him was in 1993. So that would actually, the story makes sense on that thing. And even if

187
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
 the timeline was wrong, let's say that they did this, let's say they weren't listening to Genesis.

188
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,360
 They were listening to Peggy Sue. The story takes place in the 50s or the 60s as far as his origin

189
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,160
 story. That still puts him within a normal lifetime. I saw one site that says to this day,

190
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,120
 you can see the pigman, but a lot, the other, the other accounts of him were like, "No, they

191
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,640
 tapered off." That makes me think that while I don't think the origin story is true, because even

192
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,000
 if there was an ugly person running around Canock Chase who looked like a deformed pig,

193
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,360
 they're going to have a normal life cycle. Being a, being ugly doesn't make you live longer.

194
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,680
 If this did happen in the 60s to 1993, that's about, he would be, you know, in his 30s. So that's

195
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,240
 interesting. The stories basically end, you know what I mean? It takes place in a normal timeline.

196
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,400
 It's not, this story started, this story happened in 1850. And to this day, you can still see him,

197
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
 because obviously that's made up. It's a biological organism. So I thought that was an

198
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
 interesting story. So now we're going to wave goodbye to the pigman. He's waving and then we

199
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,560
 see he's kind of like becking us towards him. We're like, "What should we go talk to him?"

200
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,560
 And then we, we notice in the bushes, there's some doggers and we're like, "Ah, no, we're cool."

201
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,480
 Pigman's like, "No, I just want to give you a hug, bro. Coronavirus. When's the last time you got a

202
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,840
 hug?" And I'm like, "It has been a while, but I'm afraid this is a trap. I'm afraid there's a

203
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,000
 bunch of doggers around you." He's like, "What? No, no." He's like pushing them back with his foot.

204
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
 "No, no. I was just, I was just adjusting that bush. Shhh. I was just shushing that bush."

205
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,640
 We leave behind Pigman and his pierced pig nipples. He stumbles off into the bush

206
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,520
 for his next rendezvous. We are going in levels of degrees. So first we have the doggers and then

207
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,360
 we just have random cryptids, UFOs, stuff like that. Now we have this pigman. Who had a happy

208
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,640
 ending, you know? He's found his true tribe. Black-eyed children is a very common story. It's

209
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
 actually so surface-level as far as paranormal stories go. I just kind of mentioned it. I've

210
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,520
 never covered it, but we're going to meet them in Canock Chase. So the sun's starting to set on

211
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,360
 the area. We're walking through the forest. Can we hear a...

212
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
 You hear that? Branding's like, "Mhmm."

213
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:48,400
 Branding's like, "It sounds like a 43-year-old man trying to sound like a creepy kid."

214
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,040
 It does. I know. It's amazing. It's amazing. We find out the source of the sound. We see behind a tree.

215
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,760
 There's a little girl sitting in there in a white dress.

216
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,520
 Branding's like, "Stop it! You've already set the mood." And then we're like, "Hey, girl, you probably

217
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
 are in trouble, but there's no way I'm going anywhere near you." The other day I was walking

218
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,040
 on the street here in Hood River. I saw Hobo throwing up and I was like, "I hope he's okay,

219
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,560
 because I'm not going to go see if he's okay." You just got to make judgment calls sometimes,

220
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:31,600
 right? From a throwing up Hobo to LaLarita. We see this little girl standing there. She's

221
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,720
 standing behind a tree and we're like, "Dude, we're not going to help you. We're sure in trouble."

222
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
 She slowly turns around and her hair is covering her face and I lean over and I'm like, "Dude,

223
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
 but she has black eyes, but she's totally one of those black-eyed kids." And she's just standing

224
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,520
 there and she's like, "I need your help. I'm not doing a Michael Jackson voice. This is my actual

225
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,640
 little girl voice. Sh'mawne." And let's get to the chase, okay? She does have black eyes. She's a

226
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,600
 black-eyed kid. That just was going nowhere. She's a black-eyed kid. Now, I normally don't talk

227
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
 about black-eyed kids. I think I've mentioned them a couple of times on this show. Super...

228
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,520
 I think the story is intriguing, but it's super surface level. Everyone knows what black-eyed

229
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,120
 kids are. There's been multiple movies made about them. The main demonic force in the show Super

230
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,920
 Natural, which is amazing again, by the way. I'm watching season 11. I love it. The main,

231
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,160
 the supernatural force in that show, they have black eyes. The black-eyed kids are

232
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
 there on the level of a big foot, a men in black UFO sighting, things like that.

233
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,680
 Why I'm bringing them up here is that according to what I can tell, cannot chase may be

234
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:47,440
 the first location these things were really seen at. There are sightings of black-eyed children

235
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,680
 going back to the 1980s with this caveat, with this caveat. People have said there are sightings

236
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,040
 going back to the 1980s. The actual earliest documented case I could find of a black-eyed kid

237
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,000
 is 1998. There was one sighted in Texas. That was the very... It was like on an email listserv.

238
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
 Some guy was like, "You won't believe what happened." And even though they are surface level,

239
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,480
 you don't know where they are. Black-eyed kids are basically a phantom. They're young kids,

240
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,440
 normally between the ages of say six and 12. They appear normal, except for the fact that

241
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
 their eyes are completely black. And they come up to your car. The very first sighting that we have

242
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,440
 recorded in documented form was in 1998. A guy was driving on the road. The children said,

243
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,760
 "Let us in your car. Let us in your car." And he wouldn't. He kept driving. The black-eyed children,

244
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,120
 they'll appear outside your house, outside your vehicle. Anywhere where you're contained,

245
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,680
 they'll show up. They'll ask for help. But you need to invite them in. And there is no story.

246
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,520
 There is not a single reputable story of someone letting them in the house and them fighting them

247
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,800
 off or tricking them around. Every story ends that I've ever seen with them being left outside the

248
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,440
 house. So the implication is if they come in the house, you don't have the ability to tell that

249
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
 story. That's what's interesting about the mythology. I have not seen one reputable story.

250
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
 Assuming any of it's reputable. But you know, demons and ghosts and all that stuff, I believe in

251
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,880
 that stuff. I've not seen one reputable story from a source that says, "Oh, I let them in the house."

252
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,680
 And then I turned around and I showed them a copy of the Bible and they burst into flames.

253
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,840
 Like, the story's always in with them not coming in the house. So the implication is,

254
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,640
 they're going to get you if you let them in. There is researchers into the Black-Eyed Children

255
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:32,400
 who say that reports go back to the 1980s. If that is true, Canock Chase is the earliest reports of

256
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,800
 Black-Eyed Children's. Whether or not they were first sighted in Texas, maybe they were taking a

257
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,160
 nice little trip during the winter. Canock Chase has the most Black-Eyed Children sightings in one

258
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,240
 given location. Black-Eyed kids are generally associated with some sort of transitory phantom.

259
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,120
 It seems to travel from location to location. Whether their stories back to the 1980s, there

260
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,920
 is definitely stories from the 1990s to today of Black-Eyed Children. And there was actually a gap

261
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,520
 of time where they weren't spotted in that area. This area is known for Black-Eyed Children. And

262
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,960
 what makes it interesting was you do, whether or not it was the first sighting, whether or not,

263
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,320
 because I could say sightings go all the way back to 1850s. I'm taking that author's word for it.

264
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,480
 They definitely go back. And it's long enough that there would be a time span where they weren't

265
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,360
 being seen in that area. So that's weird. And you have what's weird is you also have a deviation

266
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,000
 from the legend. The story is, is the Black-Eyed Children show up outside your house to be let

267
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,960
 in. These ones are in the wilderness. So there's no place to let them into. They're just there.

268
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,640
 So you don't have that defense of your house, your car. You have no way to get out of there.

269
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
 You're walking through the woods. You stumble across a Black-Eyed Child. So whether or not it

270
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
 was the very first place that the Black-Eyed Children were spotted. It definitely seems to have the

271
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,560
 largest group of sightings in a single area. So we got dogging, which is just kind of a bizarre

272
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,440
 fetish. We got pig babies. We got, and remember, don't forget, the ones I brushed over werewolves,

273
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,400
 big-foot, UFOs. We got the Black-Eyed Children. Now we're getting dark. In Britain, they had

274
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:16,080
 Operation Hydrant, and that was where the police basically laid out cases against 1400 people

275
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,800
 for charges of sex abuse, pedophilia, child porn, like I said, this gets dark. That's how Jimmy

276
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,760
 Seville got wrapped up. He was the big children's show presenter, top of the pops, all that stuff.

277
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,120
 He got wrapped up in Operation Hydrant. And while Operation Hydrant was going on, in Britain,

278
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,080
 you have the anonymity clause, where basically you can make it so your name's not available. The

279
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
 press won't go out to try to find your name. One woman said, "Nope, you can print my name. I'll

280
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,000
 totally go on the record for this. I'm going to work with the police." Her name is Esther Baker.

281
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,920
 She said in the 80s and the 90s, from about age 6 to 11, there was a high-profile politician

282
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:01,600
 who was abusing her, along with other connected people who were abusing her. She said, "Not only

283
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,000
 were they abusing me, but the police would watch. They'd bring out police guards, and they would

284
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,280
 secure the area, and they would take me out to Canock Chase and abuse me." Now, there's been

285
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,080
 stories like this labeled against Dick Cheney. You'll see people come forward and say this stuff

286
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,880
 about powerful people all the time. This story here, she said this, the police had 33 hours of

287
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,240
 interviews with her, along with 18 other hours of evidence tracing. The police said, "We are not

288
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 going to name which politician she's talking about, which judge she's talking about, but we will

289
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,400
 confirm that they are people that were targeted in Operation Hydrant." So we will confirm that.

290
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,200
 We're still looking into that. As of this day, no additional charges have been filed because

291
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,520
 of her testimony, but the police, that could mean one of two things. The police could say,

292
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,920
 "Statue limitations has passed." It could mean that we don't really believe her story, or it could

293
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,520
 mean this dude already got so many charges against him. He's wrapped up. He's going to jail, things

294
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,840
 like that. It can do all sorts of things, but she goes, "I'm going on the record. I'm saying this."

295
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,440
 She says at one point she escaped, and she's running through the woods of Canock Chase,

296
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,760
 and a police officer runs after her, grabs her, and is leading her back, and she's pleading with

297
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,000
 the police officer, "Let me go," and the cops just like, "Can't. Gotta do this. Takes this girl."

298
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,920
 Officer who's supposed to protect her, she said too, when one of her abusers was a judge, she goes,

299
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,160
 "I was always taught that the law system was basically granted by God." These are the people

300
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,920
 who are supposed to watch over and keep order in our society, and I have this judge, and I have

301
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,880
 this high-level politician. She named these people, and the police go, "These people are being investigated

302
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,120
 currently. They've been wrapped up with Operation Hydrant." But they wouldn't say it, and the

303
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,440
 newspapers weren't saying it, but she's totally on the record. As that I could see, there were no

304
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,760
 actual charges filed, but she was specifying Canock Chase as this area. It's an evil piece of land

305
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,560
 that is drawing evil people towards it, and whether it's evil people in the fore—forget

306
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,920
 the doggers. They're not evil. Again, that's just kind of a goofy fetish I wanted to start the

307
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,160
 episode off with. You have almost like a vortex of darkness in this area, and it's keeping supernatural

308
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,000
 forces in it, and it's a track out of all the places you could go. Why would these people choose

309
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,520
 Canock Chase to go to? There's actually a real reason for that, and we're going to wrap it up with

310
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,760
 probably the darkest story to come out of Canock Chase, and people who know the area were probably

311
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,040
 waiting—not waiting, you're not like, "Oh, yay!" But probably knew this one was coming.

312
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:45,600
 December 1st, 1964, nine-year-old Julia Taylor is kidnapped, assaulted, strangled, and left for

313
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,920
 dead, and as someone riding their bicycle through Canock Chase comes across her. She would have

314
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:59,120
 died due to exposure. She couldn't move. She was so weak, but she's saved. September 8th, 1965,

315
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,880
 Margaret Reynolds, six years old, goes missing. December 30th, 1965, Diana Tift, five years old,

316
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
 goes missing.

317
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,160
 January 12th, 1966, both of their bodies are found in a ditch in Canock Chase.

318
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:30,400
 August 19th, 1966, Christine Darby, seven years old, goes missing. Found three days later in Canock

319
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,880
 Chase, dead. Massive, obviously massive police presence trying to figure out what's going on.

320
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,400
 They're searching. At this point, these are known as the Canock Chase murders, or the A24 murders.

321
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:51,840
 Having these very, very, very painfully young girls being kidnapped, assaulted, and killed.

322
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:02,640
 150 detectives hit up 39,000 homes, interview over 80,000 people. They have an ID on a car.

323
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,760
 They check 25,000 vehicles. Still nothing. November 4th, 1968, girls walking through her

324
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,760
 neighborhood. A car pulls up, tries to pull the girl into the car. She breaks free. A neighbor

325
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
 sees what's going on, calls up the police, gives the license plate number. The license plate number

326
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,400
 ended up being wrong. The neighbor mixed up the last two digits, but the police go, "This is

327
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 something." And they started just going through the numbers, trying to figure out who could belong to.

328
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,880
 They find Raymond Morris. He'd actually been interviewed after the first two attacks,

329
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
 and his wife said, "Oh no, no, we were out to lunch that day. He couldn't have done that."

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,880
 But that was a lie. His, Raymond Morris' own brother, when those first two girls had gone

331
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,840
 missing before the bodies had been found, Raymond Morris' own brother went into the police department

332
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,840
 and said, "I think my brother did it. I think if anyone I know could pull off something so disgusting

333
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,320
 to take little girls, because again they hadn't been found, they're always hoping for the best

334
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,040
 that they're going to be found. But I think my brother, imagine that. Imagine having someone so

335
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,720
 sick in your life that you read on the newspaper and you're like, "I know who did that." Mixed with

336
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,040
 the torment of having to turn in your own family member, Raymond Morris' brother was like, "I got

337
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,280
 to do this." He goes to the police and said, "My brother, Raymond Morris, if anyone could do this,

338
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,320
 this is him." The police took his report and then misfiled it. So he was allowed to go on

339
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,120
 and take the life of another girl, and this is one of those killers that he has been tied to

340
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,200
 three murders, but you just never know. His, after his trial, his jury deliberation was two hours.

341
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:45,040
 He was guilty of sin, died in prison. You could say that his murders created the evil in those

342
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:51,040
 woods, or that he committed the murders in those woods because the evil drew him there in the

343
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:59,200
 first place. But I think those woods hide something, whether it's a malignant force that was created

344
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,440
 from the blood of innocent people, or something that is so dark and so deep and pervasive, it existed

345
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:14,400
 there before mankind did, just waiting for evil to be acted upon it. Now serial killers and abusers

346
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,040
 are far scarier than a black-eyed child or a pigman, but the fact that all of this stuff could

347
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:28,480
 coexist in such a small piece of land should show us that while some places look beautiful and inviting

348
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:37,840
 and peaceful, so does a Venus flytrap. You don't know you're in danger until it's too late.
