1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
 A dangerous ritual tries to get safe.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,960
 One of the earliest modern vampire legends strikes fear across Europe.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,320
 And then we take a look at a case of a man walking through the woods alone.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,640
 And when something unusual happens to him, does he meet a ghost?

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,640
 Or does he enter an alternate reality today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,240
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,720
 Day 3 of Vampire Week, episode 3 of Recording It in a Day.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,840
 I've recorded three episodes in a single day before.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,040
 Never recorded four, so we'll see how these next two go.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,640
 This one I should be fine on. I just took about a half hour break,

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
 opened up the windows, got some fresh air, cracked open a diet A&W root beer.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 Should be ready to go here.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,480
 Let's go in and get started with our first story.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Now for our first story, we are traveling.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,080
 Let's take the rabbit rowboat. We haven't used that thing in a while.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
 Let's hop in the rabbit rowboat.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,920
 We are going to row all the way from Hood River, Oregon to Spain.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 Simple trip. People do it all the time.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
 You take an ore, I take an ore. Let's start rowing.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
 We're going to be so yoked by the time we're done.

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,520
 Just super muscular. Just one side of her body though.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
 I've been using a walking stick to get around. I kind of ditched the crutches.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
 My foot's still injured.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
 Been using walking stick to get around.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
 And I swear my left shoulder is just getting bulked out.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
 Because the stick I found, the stick itself has to weigh like 10-15 pounds.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
 Ah, that might be an exaggeration.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,520
 I'd say probably between 5 and 10 pounds.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
 And just walking for like a mile with it.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
 You're really working out. And I can't like switch arms

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
 because the injury is on my left side.

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,600
 So we'll see what monstrosity I end up becoming.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,880
 But anyways, we're going to row all the way to Spain.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,800
 So we go around South America.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,480
 We almost said South Africa.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
 Caught myself.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
 We're going to go around South America.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
 Travel up to Spain.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,840
 We're going to a place called Matel El Pino.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
 Matel El Pino.

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,560
 This is one of those towns that does the running with the bulls.

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
 Might be the only town, I'm not for sure.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,760
 But anyways, bulls.

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
 I thought Madrid did running with the bulls.

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
 But anyways, this town either also does running with the bulls

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
 or is the only place it is running with the bulls.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,240
 You're like Jason, just do your research.

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,560
 We're walking around Spain.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
 We're wrestling each other.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
 No, we're wrestling each other.

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
 We're using our strong arms to win arm wrestling contests.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
 Going over the top.

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
 We're in Spain.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
 Now they recently have said, listen guys.

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,120
 This running with the bulls is inhumane to the bulls.

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,920
 Because we make all these bulls run down a hill.

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
 And they hate it apparently.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
 But even though we can't talk to them, I'm sure they love it.

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
 I'm sure they look forward to it every year.

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
 Because they get to gore slow people and they get to run.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
 What animal doesn't like running?

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,480
 And then a snail or a fish or anything being pursued by a lion.

66
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
 But animals just love running.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
 But anyways, they said animals don't like it.

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
 They don't want to run around.

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,880
 They want to be like Captain Cajun or something like that.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,560
 So I guess there's probably an in-between between imprisoning them,

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
 making them run down a hill.

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,600
 Anyways, the point is that the city goes, it's inhumane to the bulls.

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
 So, but people still like running down hills.

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
 So we still want to have something.

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,600
 So some marketing exec, some genius comes up with the idea.

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,360
 What if we just change one letter?

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,000
 And they're like, running with the bulls?

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
 And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
 That's the wrong letter.

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,960
 What if we change the bulls to bulls?

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,040
 Everyone's like, what are you talking about?

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
 He's like, hold on, hold on.

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,680
 Pulls out his pie chart.

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,200
 That's a Venn diagram.

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,520
 Here's the people who love running.

86
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,880
 Here's the people who are afraid of bulls.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,480
 So there's an intersection there.

88
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,240
 And they're like, yeah, that is pretty good intersection.

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,160
 Who isn't afraid of bulls?

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,920
 So the city decides to have a running of the bulls.

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
 And they've been doing it for a while now.

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,480
 Here's the thing.

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,160
 So it's not like you're running down a hill

94
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,000
 and they're like throwing marbles after you.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,040
 It's not like you're running down a hill

96
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
 and they're just throwing bouncing balls after you.

97
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
 They made a foam bull.

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
 So you're like, oh, that's pretty dope.

99
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,720
 You know, I can outrun a ball of foam.

100
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
 It's nine feet tall.

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,240
 So nine feet in circumference would be a better way to put it

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,040
 since it's a ball.

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
 You're like, it's kind of big for a giant ball of foam.

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
 It weighs 600 pounds.

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
 So yes, it is made of foam and that's cool.

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
 But if it hits you, it's not going to be like,

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
 oh, you want to take a nap.

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
 It will kill you.

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
 It will do serious damage.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
 And it's the same thing.

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
 You get on the top of the hill and they roll this ball after you.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
 It has the painting of a bull's head on it.

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
 And you run down the hill and this ball is coming after you.

114
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,160
 And it's funny because they thought about the first one.

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,640
 They said, hey, maybe we should give everyone a helmet.

116
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,760
 And the organizer said, no, no, because if we give them a helmet,

117
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,280
 then people will think, well, I can just get hit by the ball on the head

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,000
 and it'll be fine.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
 It looks like someone's rolling a styrofoam ball after you.

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
 There's a lot of video footage of this thing.

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
 So if they go, if we give them a helmet,

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
 they'll think the helmet can actually protect them from this thing and it won't.

123
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
 We don't want to give them helmets because it will kill them if they stop.

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
 And they're actually told at the beginning of the race, this is a quote,

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
 if there is no escape, that's what you always want to hear before you get involved

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
 in any sort of sport or game.

127
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 If there is no escape, that is a reality.

128
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
 If there is no escape, it's better to lie down and let the ball run over you.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
 Okay, guys, let's go.

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
 Woo.

131
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,800
 And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,520
 Can you repeat that?

133
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,920
 The problem is that people do think, oh, it's a giant foam ball and they're running.

134
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,520
 And they're like, I'm tired.

135
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
 I can't run any further.

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
 Now, if there were bulls chasing them, they know that if they stop,

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
 they're going to get gored or trampled.

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 There's a real threat with the bull.

139
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
 But people see the foam ball coming and they're like, I'm tired.

140
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
 I'll just let it hit me.

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,640
 People have been in comas from this thing.

142
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
 This one guy had to get airlifted out.

143
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
 He suffered massive brain damage.

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,920
 That one is on video, unfortunately.

145
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,640
 I saw that one.

146
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,440
 He just stood there and the ball hit him.

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
 And then the ball keeps going down the hill and he's just laying on the ground.

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
 Like it smashed into him.

149
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
 One guy had a bunch of ribs.

150
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,480
 He wasn't eating ribs.

151
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,360
 He's like, delicious.

152
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
 The ball rolls past him.

153
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
 He had broken ribs.

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,880
 So yeah, it's funny because they're trying to make it less inhumane for the bulls.

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
 And they did that because they're not involved at all anymore.

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
 But now it's actually more dangerous for the humans because they don't perceive a threat.

157
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,480
 And I know you guys are thinking, well, they're stupid for standing in front of a giant ball

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,200
 in the first place.

159
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,720
 But again, I think if you saw a giant ball of cotton candy rolling down a hill,

160
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
 you'd be like, this is delicious.

161
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,600
 If you wouldn't realize that it weighed a ton.

162
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 Like a ton of cotton candy is still a ton of something hitting you.

163
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,960
 And it does look like just a giant foam ball.

164
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,160
 At one point it hit a barricade and exploded halfway through the race.

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
 And I think again, that made people think, oh, it's just nothing.

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,240
 But it can kill you.

167
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,920
 And now they're thinking about putting like rubberized bumpers on the wall or something

168
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,240
 like that.

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,120
 But it doesn't matter.

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,840
 I think they're going to have to either cancel it or go back to, you know what they should do?

171
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
 They should do running of the breeze where people just run down the hill

172
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,760
 and you have giant fans at the top of the hill and you just try to beat the wind.

173
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
 That'll be the safest way to do it.

174
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,320
 I wouldn't do it anyways.

175
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,800
 I wouldn't do it if I just don't like running at all or down a hill or being pursued by anything.

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
 But running of the balls, if you ever want to go to Spain, that's what you're up to now.

177
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
 Now our next story is part of Vampire Week.

179
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,560
 Vampire Week was inspired by a list of emails I got from Mason Nordbeck.

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
 He's a Patreon supporter.

181
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
 I've been talking to that.

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
 He's been listening to the show for a long time.

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,040
 I've exchanged a ton of emails with that dude.

184
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,000
 He's a good guy.

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,920
 But he sent me all these vampire stories.

186
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,720
 Now this is a story that I discovered while I was perusing his vampire stories.

187
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
 He didn't specifically inspire this one, but he inspired the week overall.

188
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
 So thank you Mason for giving this week that I have to record in one day some structure.

189
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,960
 We're going to hop back in the rabbit rowboat and apparently we're going to hope that there is a river

190
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
 leading from Spain to Serbia.

191
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
 Otherwise we're going to have to pick the rowboat up and carry it over land.

192
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,360
 Actually we'll do that because that way we'll lift it with our opposing arm and get that one strong

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,680
 as well.

194
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,920
 So by the time we get to Serbia we're just these hulking figures walking into town.

195
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,680
 And along the walk we also went through a time tunnel and we ended up in the year 1725.

196
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
 We're headed to the town.

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
 Tell me this town doesn't sound like a carabare.

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
 Tell me this town doesn't sound like a name of an 80s cartoon.

199
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,520
 We're headed to it's a village actually, but we're going to Serbia.

200
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,640
 We go into the village of Kisi Lava.

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,560
 Kisi Lava.

202
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,000
 Wasn't there a show called Kisi Fur or something like that?

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
 There was like a little animated bear dancing around.

204
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,320
 It was like a Teddy Repskin ripoff or something like that.

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,360
 Kisi Fur.

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
 But anyways this is Kisi Lava.

207
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
 That is that's adorable.

208
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
 That is a town that you just kind of want to go and propose in, but not back then.

209
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
 Not back in 1725.

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
 It was a horrible place to live in.

211
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,280
 Austrian Empire Turks weren't getting along or they were.

212
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,600
 I'm not really good on ancient European history, but

213
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,680
 the land, Serbia was being traded off between rival empires and Austria finally takes control of it.

214
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,360
 And they say, "Hey, we're going to put out a bunch of dudes and women because we don't just want dudes out there.

215
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
 We're going to make a bunch of people go.

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
 We're going to offer a bunch of people land out in the middle of Serbia.

217
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
 So they start farming there so we can like have a claim to it."

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,280
 And eventually this like the land keep did keep changing hands between these empires, but

219
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,200
 it was kind of like a village that sprung up apparently.

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,280
 There could be European history experts you're pulling hair out right now.

221
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,320
 I could be totally off on that, but from my notes, that's what I got it.

222
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,600
 In Kisi Lava, there was a dude named Pitar Plogojawitz.

223
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,160
 Plogo... I think I had to write the first time.

224
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,200
 Plogojawitz.

225
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,520
 Pitar or Peter.

226
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,240
 We'll call him Peter.

227
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
 Because he's here.

228
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
 So Peter, he's like, "That's not my name. My mom named me Pitar."

229
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,520
 And I was like, "Listen, you're not going to want their name in 300 years.

230
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,400
 It sounds ridiculous."

231
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,680
 He's like, "Okay, fine."

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
 And then he goes, "How'd you guys get so buff?"

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
 And we were like, "Oh, we had a rowboat."

234
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,200
 And we show him.

235
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
 We do a training montage.

236
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,520
 He's like working out on the rowboat and then he's carrying it around.

237
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,480
 And then we're like jumping all in the air at the same time, freeze frame.

238
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,160
 So anyways, Peter is all swole up like us now, but it doesn't help him because it's 65.

239
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
 He passes away.

240
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,480
 He passes away because he was just working out too hard.

241
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
 His heart gave up.

242
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
 And we're like looking at each other.

243
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,080
 We're like, "Uh-oh, is that going to happen to us?"

244
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
 Peter dies.

245
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,280
 Three days later, his son's sitting at home, just chilling, watching,

246
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,560
 watching me at Flix because they don't have anything.

247
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,840
 It's like, "Sons at home, he's doing absolutely nothing."

248
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,640
 And here's a knock on the door.

249
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,520
 He's like, "That's weird. It sounds like someone's just knocking on a table."

250
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,200
 That didn't sound like someone knocking on the door.

251
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
 He goes and gets the door.

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
 It's his dad.

253
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,240
 He's like, "Dad, you look so good.

254
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,480
 You put on so much muscle mass in the past couple of weeks.

255
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
 He's like, "I was working out."

256
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
 And then the son goes, "Wait a second.

257
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
 You died three days ago."

258
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
 And Peter goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
 About that.

260
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,520
 I'm hungry.

261
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,760
 You got anything for me to eat?"

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
 And the son goes, "Uh, yeah, sure.

263
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,960
 I got like some beans and sprouts and carrots and stuff like that

264
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,840
 because we're peasants in 1725 Serbia."

265
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,360
 Dad's like, "That's all I ever wanted."

266
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,600
 So he goes eat some peas, beans, whatever, whatever they have back then, and leaves.

267
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
 Now the son tells everyone in town the next day,

268
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 "You won't believe what happened."

269
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,760
 Townspeople are just silent.

270
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,280
 They're like, "We have no imagination.

271
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,360
 We're peasants in 1725.

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,680
 Everything is stuff we don't believe can happen."

273
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
 And the son's like, "Yeah, yeah, I know.

274
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
 I'm on board with you on that."

275
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
 My dad showed up at my house last night and ate food.

276
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
 He came to my house and asked if I had food and I gave him some food.

277
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,120
 The townspeople are like, "That's terrifying.

278
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
 That's absolutely horrifying."

279
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,080
 The son's like, "I know.

280
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,600
 I'm afraid he's going to come back tonight."

281
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,840
 So son stays up all night, has a little meal set up,

282
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,800
 has a little mixed bean, three bean salad, some dip.

283
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
 Dad doesn't show up.

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 The son's like, "Eat the beans."

285
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
 Goes to bed.

286
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,800
 But the next night, dad shows back out of the house and says,

287
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
 "Son, I'm hungry again.

288
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,800
 Can I eat some more of your delicious beans?"

289
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,320
 And the son, for whatever reason, says, "No, dad.

290
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,840
 I'm not going to feed you tonight."

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
 And the next morning, they found the son's body.

292
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,120
 So let me step back from the story here for a second.

293
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
 That story is almost considered a separate fable to the main story.

294
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,680
 And it kind of makes sense because how would they know what the final conversation was

295
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
 if his body was found the next day?

296
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
 From a skeptics viewpoint, that doesn't make sense.

297
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
 We wouldn't know what they discussed.

298
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,280
 It would just be, "Dad shows up one night, eats some food.

299
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,960
 Dad doesn't show up the second night.

300
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
 Third night, the kid's dead."

301
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,680
 Like, you wouldn't know if he showed up or not.

302
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
 There's no one to tell that story the body said.

303
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
 But anyway, so that story is kind of seems to be added on to the main story.

304
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,960
 The main story is this.

305
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,560
 I like that little prologue, though.

306
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
 What happens is, is that Peter does die.

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,280
 That's a historical record.

308
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,160
 I'm sure he had a son.

309
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,480
 I'm sure he's going to make that part up.

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
 But anyways, he dies.

311
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,640
 And people in town start getting sick.

312
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
 Like, deathly sick.

313
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
 Like, they're going to die.

314
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
 And they would say on their deathbed, they'd be like,

315
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,360
 "Come here. Come here, son.

316
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
 I want to tell you a story."

317
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
 They're like, "Oh, cool.

318
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,840
 You want to tell me about Kissy Lava and the magical rainbow adventure?"

319
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,200
 And he's like, "No.

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
 The other night, the night I got sick, son,

321
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,280
 I was sleeping in my bedroom and a man walked in."

322
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 And it was Peter.

323
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,120
 He was just a dude.

324
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,360
 He wasn't my grinder request.

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
 It was Peter.

326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
 And it sounds like grinder request like stone grinder.

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah.

328
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
 I requested some stones to be grinded

329
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
 because I'm a peasant.

330
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,800
 And that guy comes late at night, too.

331
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,840
 But no, it wasn't that.

332
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,360
 It was Peter.

333
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,520
 That guy had been dead already.

334
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,080
 He'd come into my house late at night.

335
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,440
 And he strangled me.

336
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,200
 And then I woke up.

337
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
 I thought it was a horrible dream.

338
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,320
 And then I got super sick.

339
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,760
 And now I'm dead.

340
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
 And the family would be like, "Oh, no."

341
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
 And other people in town would be like, "Come here, daughter.

342
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,160
 I'm not going to do the story again."

343
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
 But other people in town were falling sick as well.

344
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
 And they would say on their death bed,

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
 "I was sleeping.

346
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,840
 Peter came into my bedroom and strangled me.

347
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,360
 And I woke up and everything was fine until I became deathly ill."

348
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
 Within eight days of the first sighting of Peter

349
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,280
 walking around town strangling people,

350
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,960
 nine people died.

351
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,720
 So this isn't like, "Oh, no.

352
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,120
 This guy got some like, wasting disease.

353
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,160
 He got the consumption and a bunch of other old,

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
 timey diseases and he dies after six months."

355
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
 Like, people are getting sick and dying

356
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,400
 in a very, very short amount of time.

357
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,200
 People are flipping, "Oh, and there's another weird segue."

358
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,920
 Apparently, he's going around, he's strangling people.

359
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
 Is a dead man.

360
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,320
 And then he goes to his wife's house,

361
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,120
 he's already been to his son's house, asking for food.

362
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,800
 He goes to his wife's house,

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
 revenant walking through the village.

364
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,560
 Spooky fog everywhere.

365
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,240
 Where, knocks on his wife's door.

366
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
 Wife opens the door and he goes,

367
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
 "Where are my shoes?

368
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
 Where are my shoes?

369
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
 Where are my shoes?"

370
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,440
 And that story is repeated in almost every version

371
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,320
 of the Peter story.

372
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,080
 Like, the story about the son feeding

373
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
 appears in some of the versions I've read.

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
 But all of them say that one night,

375
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,560
 he knocked on his wife's door, asked for his shoes.

376
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,440
 We don't know if she gave him the shoes.

377
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
 Which I'm kind of curious about.

378
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
 Like, why not just give the guy his shoes?

379
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,000
 What we do know is he came to the house

380
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
 and said, "I want my shoes."

381
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,520
 And she moved away.

382
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
 She left town.

383
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,120
 Which seems like a bit of an overreaction.

384
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,600
 Like, just give him his shoes and then just stay in town.

385
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,960
 But, she leaves town.

386
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,800
 So the wife just bounces out.

387
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,760
 He's like, "My shoes!

388
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 She was the only one who had my shoes!"

389
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
 He's just walking around barefoot everywhere.

390
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,320
 That's why he's strangling people.

391
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 He's like, "Maybe someone else has my size of shoes.

392
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,600
 They'll be buried in them."

393
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
 I guess he could just steal them.

394
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,080
 I mean, he's a vampire.

395
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,040
 But anyways, so the townspeople are freaking out at this point.

396
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,080
 They're like, "He's a vampire.

397
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,880
 This guy's a vampire."

398
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,200
 Now, vampires weren't really well known

399
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
 in Western Europe at this time.

400
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,520
 It was considered this old peasant myth.

401
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,760
 The stories of vampires went back centuries,

402
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,560
 but it was just considered like this real bumpkin thing.

403
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,640
 Even in Eastern Europe,

404
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,920
 it was something that the hillbillies of Europe believed in.

405
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,840
 And there was a dude.

406
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,240
 He was the imperial provisor from Bald.

407
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,960
 From Bald.

408
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
 What horrible name.

409
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,000
 And I don't know if that's his first name or his last name.

410
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,280
 He's always referred to as Imperial Provisor from Bald.

411
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,360
 So anyways, from Bald is in town.

412
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
 He's taking care of business every day.

413
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
 Taking care of business.

414
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,360
 They're like, someone's like, picks up the phone.

415
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,400
 He's like, "Hey, hey, Bachman Turner overdrive.

416
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
 You want that new sound?

417
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
 Listen to this."

418
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
 And the guy's like singing it.

419
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,400
 And then he realizes phones haven't been invented.

420
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,680
 He's just talking to a banana,

421
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
 which aren't even in Eastern Europe.

422
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 But anyways, anyways,

423
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
 the guy's totally just a lunatic.

424
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,320
 So anyways, the guy's taking care of business every day.

425
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,760
 And the towns people say,

426
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,400
 "Hey, listen, man,

427
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
 you got to do something about this vampire dude.

428
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,840
 Like he's killing all these people."

429
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,720
 Now, from Bald is like, that's not true.

430
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,320
 I don't know if they're saying it's vampires.

431
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,520
 They don't exist.

432
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,120
 But if they do exist,

433
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,320
 what you're asking me to do is to disinter a body

434
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,080
 and do some voodoo on it.

435
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,760
 And I don't have the authority to do that.

436
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
 Like I have to get permission from my bosses

437
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,800
 to desecrate the dead.

438
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,080
 That's totally ridiculous.

439
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,360
 And the towns people said,

440
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,640
 "Okay, dude, you have a choice."

441
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
 Because again, it's not like you could just pick up the phone.

442
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,040
 They had to send like messengers on horseback

443
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,360
 and they had to like outrun wolves and stuff like that.

444
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,280
 It would take months to get this message.

445
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,920
 Towns people said,

446
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,160
 "Listen, either you go with us to disinter the body

447
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
 because we don't want to do it by ourselves,

448
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,160
 or we're all going to leave town."

449
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,040
 And from Bald,

450
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,480
 that's the reason why the people are there

451
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,040
 in the first place.

452
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,480
 They're trying to take back the land.

453
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,560
 Fine, I'll do it.

454
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 So from Bald actually goes and ropes a priest into it.

455
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
 They go to the guy's grave and they dig it up.

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
 And that's when we get the classic idea of like disintering a corpse

457
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,120
 and finding the traces of a vampire.

458
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
 They said he was undecomposed,

459
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,720
 which technically I think the term is composed,

460
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,760
 but they find his body and it's totally fine.

461
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
 He has a beard.

462
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
 He has new skin and nails.

463
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,800
 His fingernails are a bit longer.

464
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
 And he has blood on his mouth.

465
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,160
 And the towns people at this point,

466
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
 they're not scared anymore.

467
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,640
 They're outraged that there's vampires in their town.

468
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,000
 Like someone gets a steak,

469
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
 they put it right through his heart

470
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,080
 and they said fresh blood comes out of his mouth and his ears.

471
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
 And then they're like, "Okay, this is super gross."

472
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
 They pull the body out, they burn it.

473
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
 Now this story got picked up by newspapers in Western Europe.

474
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,120
 And it was just kind of like,

475
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,480
 "Look at these crazy bumpkins.

476
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
 They believe in vampires.

477
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,960
 What a bunch of yokels."

478
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,000
 And it started what's known as the 18th century vampire controversy.

479
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
 Because even though the original thing was,

480
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,280
 these people are stupid,

481
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
 it exploded in Western Europe.

482
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
 And all of a sudden you had like,

483
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
 all of these learned people

484
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
 who are all about the age of enlightenment

485
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
 afraid that vampires were real.

486
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,920
 Now there was one other story in Serbia

487
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,600
 that took place about 10 years earlier.

488
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
 A guy named Arnold Paol,

489
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
 which is kind of a similar story.

490
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
 I thought this story was more interesting.

491
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,680
 It's kind of the same along the same lines though.

492
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,280
 But so those two stories separated by about a decade,

493
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
 being reported in the media,

494
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
 it caused people all over Europe

495
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,800
 to really believe that vampires are real.

496
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,440
 And they say that a lot of the legends we have of vampires,

497
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
 specifically the fact that you could open up the grave

498
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,400
 and see that they're still fresh and they look young.

499
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
 And you got to stake them and all that stuff,

500
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,480
 come from those old Serbian legends,

501
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,920
 specifically those stories.

502
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,520
 And what's weird is as I was looking into this,

503
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,160
 there is actually an other practice that involved it.

504
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
 Because I thought,

505
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,880
 what's the logical reason why blood's coming out of this guy's mouth?

506
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,440
 Like I thought,

507
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,800
 I don't think they're making that detail up.

508
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,320
 What could actually cause that?

509
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,800
 There is a thing called purge fluid,

510
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,880
 which is the name of my new punk rock band.

511
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
 Purge fluid is basically all of the,

512
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,560
 it's not necessarily blood,

513
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,960
 but it can be easily mistaken for blood.

514
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,080
 It's pus and goo and some blood,

515
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
 much of other disgusting stuff.

516
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
 And when you press on bodies, it pops out.

517
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
 And the fingernail is getting longer,

518
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
 it's because your skin starts to get tiny.

519
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
 Same thing with the beard.

520
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
 Your, it doesn't get tiny.

521
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,160
 Your skin doesn't become like a little munchkin.

522
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,680
 But it gets tight on the skin.

523
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,360
 So beard follicles will pop out,

524
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
 your nails will get longer and stuff like that.

525
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
 But anyways, this whole thing with purge fluid,

526
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,680
 they actually used to use that to tell if people were murdered.

527
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,000
 Well, they knew they were murdered because they had stab wounds in them,

528
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
 but they had it for hundreds of years

529
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,200
 from like the sixth century to like the 18th century.

530
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,080
 They had this thing where if they found a dead body,

531
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,600
 that was murdered,

532
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,680
 they would make the murderer touch it.

533
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,800
 And if purge fluid,

534
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,400
 if the body started bleeding again,

535
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
 that means he was the murderer.

536
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
 And sometimes they would test it

537
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,320
 where one person would touch the body

538
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,280
 and then nothing would happen.

539
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,040
 And then another guy would walk up and touch the body

540
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,240
 and it's all, "Pfft!"

541
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,360
 But just stuff comes out.

542
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,240
 And King James, the guy who wrote the Bible,

543
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,200
 he didn't write the Bible,

544
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
 but King James,

545
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
 famous for having the King James translation of the Bible,

546
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
 he said that it was God's way of supernaturally pointing out a murderer.

547
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
 Instead of just like a lightning bolt

548
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,240
 coming out of the sky and frying the guy,

549
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
 they knew it shouldn't happen.

550
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
 If you had a body, there should be no fresh blood in it.

551
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
 But if you had a body and a murderer touched it,

552
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,640
 it would bleed.

553
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,920
 So it's weird because it was a known phenomenon at the time,

554
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,040
 but it was only attributed to murder victims.

555
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,200
 So the fact that you had someone who died

556
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,160
 just because of old age or just getting sick,

557
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,600
 also bleeding at the mouth,

558
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
 they had to go, "Well, he wasn't murdered,

559
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,080
 so he must be a vampire."

560
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,560
 But really though Arnold Powell,

561
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,360
 that story,

562
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,920
 and then this Peter Blojowicz,

563
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,200
 they really started what we know of the vampire legends

564
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
 because that really all just kind of came from Europe.

565
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
 Very, very interesting story.

566
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
 Was he a vampire now?

567
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,640
 I mean, forgetting the purge fluid stuff.

568
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,760
 Why were the people having that dream of him coming in,

569
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
 or was it a dream?

570
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
 Was it?

571
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
 Okay, probably was a dream,

572
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
 but it's just interesting these people were having

573
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,160
 these encounters with this spirit,

574
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,040
 the very least,

575
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,480
 or vampire at the very most,

576
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
 and then them dying in a very short order.

577
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,520
 To lose nine people in eight days is quite a lot.

578
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,880
 And most importantly,

579
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
 which my question is,

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,680
 why was he just asking the sun for food?

581
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,120
 Why was he then drinking from the sun?

582
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
 Was the sun lying?

583
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,040
 Was the sun actually providing him with like lamb blood

584
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,760
 or something like that?

585
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,400
 And they're like,

586
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
 "Your dad came to eat a three bean salad."

587
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880
 And he's like, "Yeah, three bean salad."

588
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
 And he really has so much as sheep guts in his yard.

589
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
 Bizarre.

590
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
 But yeah, that's really where a lot of those legends come from.

591
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
 18th century vampire controversy.

592
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
 That is also a great name for a band.

593
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,560
 This is the band name episode.

594
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,240
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

595
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
 Now, last up story is one of those stories

596
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
 that is one person,

597
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
 single witness,

598
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,600
 never been documented again.

599
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
 So he's either making it up,

600
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
 someone else made it up on his behalf,

601
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,160
 really vent that he misinterpreted or it's true.

602
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,600
 Let's take a look at this story here.

603
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
 Very super vague, super vague story.

604
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,760
 50 years ago,

605
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,200
 that's all the information we have.

606
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
 I don't know when the article was written.

607
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,440
 This is from a website called Supernatural Magazine,

608
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
 which surprisingly is not about the hit shows, Supernatural.

609
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,200
 That show's ending.

610
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,760
 That's crazy.

611
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,560
 I should catch up on that.

612
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,200
 I should catch up on the eight seasons I haven't watched.

613
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,760
 I don't know if it's like season 14 or something like that.

614
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,720
 Supernatural Magazine.

615
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
 50 years ago,

616
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
 there was an unnamed man,

617
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
 there was an unnamed man

618
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,680
 walking through Wisconsin.

619
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,120
 So super vague, super vague.

620
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,160
 Now, the guy who's writing the article says that he had a friend

621
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,680
 tell him this story.

622
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,240
 And he goes,

623
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,320
 "I didn't want to reveal this guy's name."

624
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
 And that's why I think he goes,

625
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
 "It's a forest between here and here.

626
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
 I think you don't want to give any details

627
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
 that could possibly identify this person."

628
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,320
 But supposedly this is a really remote forest in Wisconsin.

629
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,480
 So this dude is walking through the forest, right?

630
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
 He's hunting.

631
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,400
 He has his rifle chilling, birds chirping,

632
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
 flowing him out of the sky.

633
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
 He's like, "Oh wait, no, I'm not here to hunt deer.

634
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
 I shouldn't just shoot everything."

635
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
 Shoots a rabbit.

636
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,840
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, I'm not hunting rabbit either."

637
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,040
 So I'm through the forest and he sees a stump.

638
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,000
 He goes, "I'm going to sit on that stump.

639
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
 I'm going to put my rump on that stump,

640
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
 like an Octosiex character,

641
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
 and look at this lump."

642
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
 And he sits down on the stump.

643
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
 And as he thinks of good hump,

644
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
 he puts his rifle on his lap.

645
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,280
 That's never an "A Dr. Seuss" book.

646
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,000
 Should be though.

647
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It'd be awesome if you just have a guy walking around Whoville.

648
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
 He's like, "I have to clean up the streets.

649
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,560
 I have to clean up the streets of Whoville."

650
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,160
 So anyways, anyways, anyways.

651
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,960
 So Dr. Seuss here is sitting on this lump.

652
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
 Damn it, he's sitting on a stump.

653
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
 Dr. Seuss is sitting on a stump with his rifle, right?

654
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,040
 And what was weird?

655
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,960
 I should have said this detail earlier

656
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,400
 before I got into that stupid thing.

657
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
 He's walking through the Dr. Seuss,

658
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,440
 he's walking through the woods.

659
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
 He sees this stump.

660
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,720
 I'm backing up that far.

661
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,320
 And next to the stump was a four feet plank of wood.

662
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,680
 And he goes, "That's weird."

663
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,600
 Because he was in a remote area.

664
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,480
 He's not on a trail.

665
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,200
 He's hunting deer.

666
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,640
 He's not walking around hikers.

667
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,040
 He sees a stump that's perfect for sitting.

668
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,320
 And he sees a four foot plank sitting next to it.

669
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
 He goes, "That's bizarre.

670
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,520
 Someone must have been here before me,

671
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
 in the middle of nowhere."

672
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
 Not unusual, but unlikely.

673
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
 So he sits down next to the stump

674
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,040
 and he's thinking about stuff.

675
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,360
 He's thinking about his plans against Toofill.

676
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,120
 And then he hears a "BAM!"

677
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
 And he flies off the stump.

678
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,760
 He said he fell back several feet.

679
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
 And he just lands on his back.

680
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
 And he's in shock.

681
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,080
 And he goes, "The first thing I did was check myself for wounds."

682
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,720
 He goes, "I thought that somebody had shot me."

683
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,280
 So he's laying on it and he started feeling around his chest.

684
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,960
 I've done that too.

685
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
 Like when I lived in bad neighborhoods,

686
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,360
 whenever I heard gunfire, I have this thing

687
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,200
 where I look at each of my hands.

688
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,400
 I look at each of my feet.

689
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,280
 This is what happens when you grow up in bad neighborhoods.

690
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,360
 You have to do stupid garbage like this.

691
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
 I'd hear a gunshot.

692
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,600
 Because a lot of times you can get shot.

693
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,560
 You won't even know it.

694
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
 I look at my hands.

695
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,720
 I look at my feet.

696
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
 I look at my shirt, my chest.

697
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,680
 And then I close one eye and then I close the other eye.

698
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,960
 And I go, "Okay, I'm not shot."

699
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,560
 That's what happens when you spend 30 years in the ghetto.

700
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,160
 That's what happens.

701
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,960
 You just build weird survival technique things like that.

702
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,280
 Because you can easily just be like, "Oh, that was cool."

703
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,720
 And then you just bleed out.

704
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
 Because you're in shock.

705
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,680
 You got a bullet right through the eyeball or something like that.

706
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,600
 So anyways, he does the same thing.

707
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
 He starts feeling around his body.

708
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,640
 He's not shot.

709
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,600
 He realizes he's not shot.

710
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,840
 Then he thinks, "Maybe my own rifle went off."

711
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,920
 Because the sound was so close.

712
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
 So he checks his rifle.

713
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,120
 No bullet has been discharged.

714
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
 Pax's gear up gets out of the forest.

715
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,960
 Now, he tells his friend, the guy who's writing for Supernatural Magazine,

716
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,240
 "Do you know what this could be?"

717
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,880
 And the guy who wrote for Supernatural Magazine said,

718
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
 "He had two theories.

719
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,920
 One of them I didn't really get."

720
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,960
 Well, I got it.

721
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
 I just didn't really buy into it.

722
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
 But one of them was that it could have been,

723
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,040
 and this is an interesting one, a ghost reenactment.

724
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,920
 So what he may have been going through is basically reliving a haunting.

725
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,560
 Imagine that someone had been there before.

726
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,840
 Because someone had been there before.

727
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,960
 They found the plank of wood.

728
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
 Guy goes out, sits on the stump.

729
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
 He is killed there.

730
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
 He is shot and killed there.

731
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,400
 And his psychic energy remains in that lonely dark forest,

732
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,560
 day and night, day and night, day and night.

733
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,440
 For who knows how long.

734
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,240
 And then one day a guy comes and he sits where that man sat,

735
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,680
 and the haunting replays itself.

736
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,240
 There's a couple of questions with that one.

737
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,760
 Does that haunting play itself?

738
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
 Like, is that bang?

739
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
 Do you hear that bang every once in a while?

740
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,560
 The haunting play itself out?

741
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,720
 We would never know because it's such a remote part of the forest.

742
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
 Does it require a trigger?

743
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,400
 Does it require another hunter to be there for it to play itself out?

744
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,720
 Does sometimes a rabbit hop on the stump and just fly across the forest?

745
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,800
 He's like, "Oh, what the hell happened to me?"

746
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,320
 Checking his little paws.

747
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
 And I know I'm fine.

748
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
 And then his other theory had to do with like spirit wolves or

749
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,480
 Bigfoot or something like that.

750
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,680
 Like, it was some sort of...

751
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,000
 I didn't really pay attention.

752
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,440
 I went, I read a couple of paragraphs and I was like, "Yeah, I don't believe in that."

753
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,880
 But, but then I came up with my own theory.

754
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
 Which is, I think the ghost one's probably most likely one.

755
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,560
 This one's interesting too.

756
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,240
 We've talked about quantum realities before, where people die in one reality

757
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,560
 and they just shift into the next one.

758
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,080
 What if he was sitting on that stump in his reality

759
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,040
 and really did get shot and flies off the back of the stump and died,

760
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,480
 but he came into our reality where he didn't die.

761
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,840
 The idea of quantum immortality is whenever you die,

762
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,200
 you simply, you can't perceive a universe you can't perceive.

763
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
 So whenever you die, you shift to a universe where that didn't happen.

764
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
 And then you're like, "Whew, that was a close one."

765
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
 I almost got crushed by that elevator, but I didn't.

766
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
 I jumped out just in time.

767
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,560
 And then I saved my girlfriend from the evil terrorists

768
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,680
 and we got a helicopter flew away, credit started rolling.

769
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,200
 Like, you can't experience a reality where you can't experience anything.

770
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,360
 So that's the idea behind quantum immortality.

771
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
 So that could have been the case too.

772
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,400
 He could have been sitting there taking a stray slug right through the chest

773
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,120
 and then flew backwards and in that action entered a reality where he didn't,

774
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
 where he had avoided that fate.

775
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,120
 I think it's a little more comforting because it's that thing.

776
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,240
 Like, people don't really die,

777
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,040
 they just kind of continue experiencing things in their own way.

778
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,320
 I always think that's kind of an interesting way to look at death.

779
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,800
 You may mourn the loss of that person,

780
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,080
 but that person has moved,

781
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,800
 like that person has moved on to another...

782
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 That person doesn't even know they're dead,

783
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,360
 is what I'm saying.

784
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
 They're continuing to live their life,

785
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,040
 which I just find quite comforting rather than thinking they're in some ethereal dimension where

786
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,640
 any, like, there's no time or gravity or anything like that.

787
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,320
 Like, that's way more trippy than thinking,

788
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,960
 "Oh, no, no, that dude just went into another reality."

789
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,520
 And he ate it.

790
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
 He's out of slurpees right now.

791
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,400
 He's totally fine.

792
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,000
 So, but I think the creepier version is the ghost one.

793
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
 Because not only is it creepy that a guy could trigger a haunting like that,

794
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,640
 but I've talked about this several times on the show.

795
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,400
 I find the absence of humanity terrifying.

796
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
 I'm very pro-human.

797
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
 I'm very pro-civilization.

798
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
 And sure, yeah, you can walk up a mountain looking around and be like,

799
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,480
 "Oh, that's kind of cool. There's a valley and a bunch of trees and some frogs and stuff jumping around."

800
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,680
 But I don't like to be in places where there aren't humans.

801
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,600
 It's weird because I'm actually quite an introvert.

802
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,720
 Like, I like being by myself in a city.

803
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 I never want to be by myself in the middle of nowhere.

804
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
 That's absolutely terrifying to me.

805
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
 Not being...

806
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,120
 Not knowing there are other humans,

807
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
 or not knowing there is civilization around me.

808
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
 When I play Minecraft,

809
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
 when I play Minecraft,

810
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
 the first thing I do is find a village.

811
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,240
 I can't play a Minecraft game where I'm sitting in the middle and there's no one around me.

812
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,360
 Like, I need to know that there are people in the...

813
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,880
 And then they all get slaughtered.

814
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,880
 I always make some horrible decisions and the village is destroyed by creepers or villagers or something like that.

815
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,400
 But there has to be a village.

816
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
 I don't even like playing the game until I...

817
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,280
 I'll go...

818
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,680
 Row...

819
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,480
 I've rowed a boat for it, like 45 minutes once.

820
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,400
 Trying to find a village.

821
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,960
 So, yeah.

822
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,720
 The idea of a spooky...

823
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,640
 Let me get back to the story here.

824
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,280
 And not mine.

825
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,480
 That was embarrassing.

826
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,960
 Let me get back to the story here.

827
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
 So, the idea of the woods is creepy.

828
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,680
 The idea of haunted woods is even more creepy.

829
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,480
 But the idea of, like, knowing right now,

830
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,520
 you're sitting at home,

831
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
 you're at work,

832
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
 you're driving in your car,

833
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,560
 and somewhere out there in the vast wilderness of the world,

834
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,040
 there's a haunting happening

835
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,600
 that nobody can even see.

836
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,040
 Because it's just like *pfft*

837
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,400
 Every so often, just in the woods.

838
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,600
 Like, let's say he didn't trigger it.

839
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,560
 Just every so often,

840
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
 in the woods in the middle of the day.

841
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,840
 *pfft*

842
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,400
 Birds go back to chirping.

843
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,320
 Dear walk by.

844
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,400
 That's terrifying to me.

845
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,600
 A haunted house is less scary

846
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,080
 than almost just a mindless haunting experience in the middle of nowhere.

847
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,760
 But getting violently thrown off a log

848
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,280
 is quite dangerous.

849
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,800
 There's a chance it wasn't just a residual haunting.

850
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,600
 There's a chance that it wasn't an alternate universe.

851
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,120
 There's a chance that something happened there.

852
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,080
 Some sort of ghostly or even demonic presence

853
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,400
 in that remote wilderness of Wisconsin.

854
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,920
 That wasn't a playback of a previous experience.

855
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,640
 But an introduction of a new one.

856
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,320
 It's quite possible he could have been

857
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,600
 throwing off that stump,

858
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,640
 hit his head,

859
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,520
 and laid there in the bushes until he slowly died.

860
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,120
 No one would have found him.

861
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,800
 He was in the middle of nowhere.

862
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,320
 And whatever caused that event in the first place

863
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,640
 got its own trophy.

864
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,680
 A new ghost to walk the woods.

865
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,480
 A decomposing body in the middle of nowhere.

866
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,400
 A missing hunter.

867
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,640
 And now you have two entities in that forest

868
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,520
 waiting however long it takes

869
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,160
 for someone else to take a seat on that stump.

870
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,600
