1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 A crazy subway attack in Japan has everyone thinking, "What type of society do we live in?"

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
 Then we discover a microwave that has a unique setting.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 It can tell the future.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And finally we take a look at the bizarre and terrifying science behind the question,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 "Do deaf schizophrenics hear voices?"

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I hope you guys have tuned in for our Halloween special.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 That was it.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 That was all that special about it was that intro.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is not same super Halloween-y.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 This whole month hasn't seen super spooky to me.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 So this episode will be as haunted and Halloween-y as the rest.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And speaking of Halloween-y, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 one of our newest Patreon supporters, he's totally dressed up.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 He thought this was going to be a huge occasion.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Sorry, it's not.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Keen.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Give a round of applause to Keen.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Whoa, awesome outfit, bro.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Keen, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, it totally understands.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But yeah, there's just something weird about it.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And almost to amplify my concerns about is this how Halloween's are going to be in the future?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Or is this just a one-off weirdo one?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 The last Halloween was more Halloween and we were locked inside of our houses.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Last Halloween, you couldn't even go anywhere.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And this seems less Halloween-y than that.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Although I guess global pandemic does count as a Halloween scare.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 But Keen, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We are headed all the way out to Japan for a breaking news story.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 [Demonic sound]

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Keen is flying us all the way out there.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 When the slowest vehicle, even though this is a breaking news story,

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 this is pretty much going on right now.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Everything's still pretty fluid.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But in Japan, in a train station in Tokyo, we're more safe and detergible.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We're above it.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 All this reading the newspaper.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But what was happening in the Tokyo tunnels was terror.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 This is what happened.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 They haven't released this guy's name yet.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But it's Halloween in Japan.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Everyone's getting ready to go to different Halloween parties.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Train.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugg

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 [Demonic sound]

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And it's possible that someone snapped the photo of him because he was so weird

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 before this even started.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 They're like, "I got it."

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 When this guy starts to massacre me, I want to have evidence.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But I have to say this.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 If the subway doors opened up and the police snapped a picture,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 or probably took video, right, it's not like they still have to have the camera,

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 but this guy is chilling.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 This guy looks like a real-life joker, not just in costume.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 But apparently what he did was he was running through the subway train with a knife

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and he began stabbing people.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So this guy was walking around the train.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 He was stabbing people and then he was spraying fluid,

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 which originally was reported as some sort of acid, which I thought.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Listen, Dead Rabbit Radio does not encourage acts of mass violence in any way, shape, or form.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 At all.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It's atrocious.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I think if this guy just as a joker hopped out with a knife and started stabbing people,

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 that's joker-ish.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Joker would use like a butcher knife and things like that.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And then he started, he goes, "Smell my flower!"

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And acid is now shooting out of him.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 That would be so insane.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Not just literally.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Not just literally.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He's only an insane man would do that.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But if a guy, if a guy dressed up as a supervillain started using supervillain weapons against the population,

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 you couldn't help, but I'm trying, I'm trying to use very, very careful words

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 that will not get this episode demonetized or simply just removed.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You have to...

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 There's an artistry to it.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I'm not saying it's good art.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 For moral reasons, I'm not saying it's good art.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 If somebody jumped up and started using...

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Because anyone can walk around with like a butcher knife.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 That's nothing.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 But butchers do it every day.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 But if you also were shooting acid, well, I guess I guess I'm kind of going off on a tangent.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 He didn't use acid.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I was super disappointed.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 When I was reading the news, I was like, "Aw, man!"

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 He didn't use acid.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I was making a little pennant that said Japanese joker.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I was going to be his biggest fan, but he didn't use acid.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 What he used was less supervillainy, but it's actually far more terrifying.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So I was disappointed that he wasn't like a supervillain.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 He was spraying gas or some sort of lighter fluid, and then he lit it on fire.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So he's stabbing people and trying to set people on fire.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And there's photos of people trying to jump out of the...

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 No one was killed!

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 No one was killed through all of this.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 17 people injured, but no one was killed.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And here's a tip from a journalist.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 When we say 17 injured, that literally means someone who jumped out of the subway

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 and stubbed their toe or kind of twisted their ankle to limbs missing.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's super misleading.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Probably know these 17...

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 One of them is in serious condition, but even that is a trick.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You can be in stable condition and have all your arms and legs have been ripped off by Dr. Octopus.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But you're stable.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 You're not going to die.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 But so when they say like 17 people injured, that could literally be anything from

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 twisted ankle to life-changing injury.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I got him! I got him!

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 His face burned off.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He's like, "No! Now I must become a supervillain as well."

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 They're like, "Johnny, no, you can come work for the firm.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It's a call center."

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 "No! Anyone have a coin?"

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Yeah, and it's funny because I read that article, and I was not his number one fan.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I didn't get a crush on him or anything like that.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But I did go, "That's interesting.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And isn't that what we were always promised?"

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 This is my Halloween hypothesis here.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 This is what we were always promised.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 We are--when all these horror movies started up in the 1980s, 70s what have you.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees and Freddie Krueger and Chuckie and all these knuckleheads

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 showing up on the scene entertaining us or scaring us.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I was terrified of all those dudes.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And we were always told by like the parents, teacher council or whoever, Tipper Gore,

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 the government, media, whatever, that these movies were going to cause a bunch of copycat killings.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And I remember as a kid being like, "Oh no, someone's going to dress up like Jason

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and like kill a bunch of people at a camp."

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And it never happened.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It never happened.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And for decades we were told there's a link between violent movies and violence in real life.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And you could say, "Well, this guy--"

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Because you're like, "Jason, what a second. Didn't you just cover last week?"

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I think it was last Friday.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 A woman who watched Jeepers Creepers one too many times and then chopped off her mom's head.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Yeah, but this is what I'm getting at.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 She didn't kill her mom. She wasn't the creeper.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 She didn't dress up like the creeper and stalk her mom.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 She stabbed her a bunch of times, which I mean, it's still totally horrific, right?

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But we were-- I thought by now we'd have real life villains.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I thought like Unabomber.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I remember the Unabomber popped up.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I'm just to be clear, I'm fully aware that the FBI and the CIA both listened to this podcast.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I'm very well aware of it.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 When the Unabomber first popped up, I was not a fan of his work.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I was not making a pinnant that said, "Unabomber."

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 "Unabomber," I go, "He's going to be our first supervillain."

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 But again, not a fan.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 My point is, is like, I thought we would have more supervillains by now.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I definitely thought we'd have more serial killers killing people like in movie ways.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Like who cares if you're a serial killer and you're driving up and down the freeways of America, snatching stranded hitchhikers?

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Okay, the people who care are the hitchhikers and their families.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 But I mean, on a global scale, that's boring.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 People have been doing that since the highway has been invented.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 If you're a budding serial killer and you happen to like Freddy Krueger,

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 why would you then just go off and, you know, shoot people in the face?

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 You should kill people as if you were Freddy Krueger.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 You should go into their dreams.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You should be horribly burned by their avenging parents and then go into their dreams.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Or if, I mean, think, okay, if I was really into the Friday the 13th movies, like Super In-A-Wom,

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 and I watched them over and over and over and over again,

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I would, hypothetically here at Law Enforcement,

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I would go to a summer camp and kill a bunch of people there over the course of a weekend.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 I wouldn't then just become, oh, I'm the, I'm the sprinkle killer and I kill people in Sprinkle Springs, Arizona.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 That's not cool, right?

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Just to be cool, I'm just gonna say this, no killing, no, no taking of human life or crime,

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 mass casualty or otherwise is cool.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's not cool.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 None of it is cool.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But like, if you're going to be inspired by these movies,

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 then basically I'm saying let them inspire you.

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 If you are being inspired by this movie, I would suggest not watching them anymore.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 They're rebooting Jeepers Creepers actually.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 But that's just a piece of movie trivia.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I'm not hoping, again, that people begin to don the skin of their victims and fly around.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But at the same time, that's kind of what we were told in the 80s and the 90s.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And that is why I think Halloween is so lame this year.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Because I wanted, I always had these expectations of the awesome Halloween's and every Halloween's been pretty awesome.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And even last year's, where we were locked in our house and government troops had a mess outside of our homes,

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 locking us inside, couldn't go out.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And now this, it's lame.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 So Get Your Act Together Halloween, that was a haunted Halloween rant from Jason Carpenter.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And also apparently Japanese Joker.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 We'll see if, like, eventually they're going to reveal his name.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I'm curious about more information.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I'm sure there'll be some YouTube videos of him talking about we live in a society and blah blah blah blah.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But yeah, little disappointed you didn't use acid, bro.

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 That would have been very Joker-ific.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 You know, fire, whatever.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There's so much people there, like, "Oh, burn there like Jason. Please.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The fire was bad enough. Do not encourage him to come back with acid."

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Keen, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 We're going to drive away from Japan.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 We're going to take an underwater tunnel and we're going to end up all the way back in a small town in the middle of America.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 It's one of those domed glass tunnels so you can look and you can see, like, fish and stuff.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And it's like, that's a long drive from Japan to America, but it's cool.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Like, whales are swimming by and they're, like, giving high fives to, like, dolphins.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Crushing the dolphins bones are like, "Ahh!"

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 That's the way killer whales say, "I hate you" is by giving you a high five.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 We're in the small unnamed American town.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 We're going to meet a young mother.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 She buys a little house and she's standing outside the house and she goes, "This is dope.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Like, this is our house now, little kid. I have not named you yet. I was going to buy a house first.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Let's go inside and check it out."

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And then a couple months later, this little hairless dog is walking down the street and she could, let's name this woman Nancy.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 She could tell that the dog needed a place to go.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So she adopts this dog. What's better, what a better way to start off a new house with a new dog?

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Is that a thing? Is that a thing we will do? I don't know. I've never had neither. I've never had a dog or a house.

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So, they named this little puppy Crypto. What happens is, over time, Crypto seems to have some major health problems.

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Some of them are minor. Some of them are just like, "Oh, my arm hurts."

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Which, which, which is a proper dog. A dog that doesn't have arms.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But my little paw hurts. And the major things was Crypto would have these long bouts of illnesses.

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And sometimes it would go on for a couple months and then Crypto would get better and then he'd get sick again.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And you'd be taking him to the vet and all this stuff and that's like, I don't know.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That'll be $300, please. And this went on for a while. They could never figure it out.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 When I say for a while, it's like four years. Sick and then healthy and sick and then healthy.

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And around this time, her boyfriend ends up moving in with Nancy and he has his own kids.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 So now you have this happy little family and in the middle of this happy little family is Crypto.

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 [Crypto barks]

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Now, I want you guys to be aware this is a paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And considering the amount of time I'm giving Crypto in this story should kind of let you know where this is going.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So, I figure I'm not gonna... I don't want it to come out of the blue, but anyways...

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 One day Nancy's in the kitchen making lunches for the kids and she's like, "Paint butter and jelly and jelly."

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 All of a sudden a loud noise emanates from the microwave.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 The fan, like the cooling fan just turns on out of the blue.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 [Cries]

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Then it shuts off and her microwave display says, "One new message."

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And she goes, "What? I don't get messages on this thing."

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I mean, I don't have anything in any microwave I've ever had.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It's not like I used to, but this one's broken. How in the world does this microwave have a message?

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And she had had this microwave for a while and that was when she noticed that in the instruction booklet and on the microwave itself,

240
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 there is a message feature.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 This is... this actually to me was the most unbelievable part of the story. I looked this up and there is the user manual for this type of microwave.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It is Spacemaker XL Microwave Oven.

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It allows you to record short audio messages.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 You need to go get bananas. You record these little messages and then you can play them back.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But she didn't even know this feature existed.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It said, "One new message." And it hadn't been there just a few seconds ago.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 So she's looking at it. She sees the button that allows her to play the message.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And it's static.

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 [Shhhhh]

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But underneath the static she can tell someone else is talking.

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 She can hear a voice. She can't understand it, but she can hear some things there.

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 She played it a couple of times. Super frustrating. She figured, "Whatever, I got sandwiches to fix."

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But later on when her boyfriend gets off work, she tells him about it and he listens to it and it's nothing but static.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Sounds like someone's talking in the background.

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So he listens to it again.

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And again.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And again.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And again. And she says he becomes obsessed with this.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He would just sit in the kitchen and listen to it over and over and over again.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 She said, "This was a very interesting detail to me that made this story very believable."

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 She said he listened to it tens of times a day.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And I thought, "That is reasonable."

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 If she had said hundreds of times a day or he'd get off work and all he would do is until late in the early morning listen to it.

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You'd be like, "Okay, this is obviously not true."

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Or, "This guy has no friends, no hobbies."

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But tens of times that makes sense.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Listen to it 10, 20 times in a day.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It's still pretty obsessive, but it's not overly obsessive.

269
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But as far as she could tell, he was obsessed with this message.

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And he would play it over and over again.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Now he started to determine something.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 He goes, "It sounds like a male voice and it sounds like someone speaking in a deep Southern Droll."

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And what they knew about the previous owner was it was a woman.

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So it wasn't the sense that maybe they weren't really thinking ghost at this point.

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Like the previous owner showed up and was turning on the microwave.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I don't even know if they were thinking ghost at all at this point.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 They could tell the voice was male and had a Southern Droll and that would be weird.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But maybe a radio communication, but the previous owner was a woman.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So you can chalk her ghost out of it.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 A few months later, after this recording was left, crypto begins a steep decline in his quality of life.

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And he's gotten so sick they decide to put him to sleep.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And that day, after Nancy took him to the vet and had him put to sleep, she was completely heartbroken.

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 This was her baby for years and years and years.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And she is sitting at home and she's grieving over the loss of crypto and her boyfriend gets off work.

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And the very first thing he does is he goes into the kitchen to listen to the microwave message.

286
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And she had had enough of this. She thought out of any day at all, "He needs to be here with me."

287
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And she gets up to tell him. She's going into the kitchen to tell him,

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "Quit playing with the stupid microwave for one day when all of a sudden her boyfriend meets her halfway and stops her."

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I know what it says.

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 He took her into the kitchen and they hit play.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And clearly, she said clearly she could understand what the message had said.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 The static was still there, but there was a clear, deep male voice speaking in a southern drawl,

293
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 cutting above the static and it said, "That fella right there is gonna die soon."

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 She freaks out and she goes, "I regret it."

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It was a bundle of nerves. I just put crypto down and now I'm listening to this message.

296
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 "That fella right there is gonna die soon."

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 She goes, "I reached over and I deleted the message."

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 She said a couple months later the microwave stopped working all together and they bought a new one.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I found this story online written by Fox Glovingly.

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So Fox, thanks for posting this really, really interesting read.

301
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And obviously, the two big questions to come from this is why would you build a microwave that takes a message?

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And where do I get one? But the other two questions are why?

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I think the most important, because here's the thing, as paranormal researchers,

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 the idea of a ghost leaving a message or white noise, anything like that is kind of part and parcel with,

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 there's whole parts of the ghost hunting industry that only focus on white noise.

306
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That's their research and that's their proof.

307
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Is bringing in these spirit boxes or bringing in these recordings and listening to it and trying to figure out the voices.

308
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So white noise is the idea of a ghost speaking and it being picked up on something.

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 That's not out of the realm of normal paranormal research.

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 What's interesting about this one was, one, nobody was recording it in the first place.

311
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 The microwave turned itself on and recorded it. Did the ghosts do that?

312
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 We talk about white noise as people purposely going in a haunted house with recordings to pick up voices in the static.

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 That wasn't the case.

314
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 There's no suggestion that these people were having any issues with ghosts before this started.

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 So the white noise being picked up, that's fairly normal in our world of research,

316
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 but them turning, them purposely activating a recording message to leave something.

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And why weren't they able to hear it earlier?

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 If we accept the existence of white noise, white noise is hearing static

319
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and someone goes "rumble me" and they go "DUDE, he's saying rumble me.

320
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He's saying that you and me need to fight paranormal investigator versus paranormal investigator."

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 But this was not intelligible at all for a long time.

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 They couldn't understand that.

323
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 We're talking months.

324
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But then the day that crypto was put down, you can hear it clear as day.

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 You could nibble this case away, right?

326
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 You go "well that's a little suspicious that she deleted it right away,

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 but if she had saved it, would you have believed it anyways?"

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 A skeptic is going to be like "well anyone could have left that message."

329
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So even if she had saved it, I don't know how much evidence that would have been.

330
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 It would have been nice, obviously, but I can understand in her emotional state she's got rid of it.

331
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 But why, we can say that the ghost or some sort of spirit may have been trying to pass on the message,

332
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 but why weren't they able to hear it until it already happened?

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 That's such a fascinating little sight, and there's no answer to it.

334
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 There's really no answer to it.

335
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I guess you could say maybe there's some, I mean, if I had to make something up,

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 some sort of time phase differential that had to be worked out.

337
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And when the spirit said it, it had to wait for a certain time period.

338
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But then again, I mean, I'm just making up science fiction stuff, right?

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And that is fun in a science fiction vein, but in this story it's just a creepy story.

340
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And when I read it, I was thinking, and this is a common thing.

341
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 There's actually a lot of people who believe this.

342
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 The dead are speaking around us all the time, like where you're sitting at right now.

343
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 There's probably at least two or three dead people hanging out.

344
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You're like, "That's why my room's so messy. It's not me. It's all of the damned souls."

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 No, but I mean, like, when you're in your kitchen all by yourself late at night,

346
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 we figure that, but who's to say there's not some woman standing behind you with, like, soaking wet hair,

347
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 and she's just staring at you and you'd have no idea.

348
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 She would have had no idea that there was some old country ghost standing there

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 in the kitchen going, "That fella's gonna die there soon."

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 If she didn't have a microwave there, recorded messages.

351
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But that ghost still would have looked at that dog and still would have made that statement

352
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and then went on about its business.

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So what is constantly being said, what is constantly standing behind us in the darkness,

354
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 who knows, a creepy mystery that will probably never be solved.

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Why weren't they able to hear the message until after the dog died?

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And it wouldn't have changed anything, would it?

357
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Even with someone saying, "That little fella's gonna die there soon."

358
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Crypto still would have had that decline in health.

359
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So just a bizarre story, a ghost speaking from beyond the veil,

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 a time traveler, a haunted microwave, just so many bizarre components.

361
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It really has earned its place in the world of high strangeness.

362
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 We don't have enough time today to talk about the deaf people, whether or not they hear voices.

363
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Super intriguing topic. We're gonna save that one till tomorrow.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So there's a little hook for you.

365
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 You probably could have guessed it because this episode wasn't titled something like,

366
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 "How do deaf hear voices in their head?" or something.

367
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's trippy. It's really, really trippy and I want to do it justice so we'll save it for tomorrow.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Also, I gotta change the outro. Now this has become a new something.

369
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I have to change the outro music because the new song I was using got me copyright violated

370
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 because apparently it was a very, very famous music example and I was not aware of that.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 [music]

372
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So there'll be a new and exit music here. Maybe I'll bring the old one back.

373
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I don't know, but DeadRabberRadioGmail.com is gonna be our email address.

374
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 You can also do this up at facebook.com/DeadRabberRadio.

375
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Tiktok, which I will be posting there again soon.

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Tiktok is at DeadRabberRadio.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
